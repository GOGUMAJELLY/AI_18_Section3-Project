 Early Access Review,1
"^  You see that?  Yep. That is how many hours of emotional fun this game has provided for this squid. Literally got me speaking in an old-timey english accent for hours after playing. This game, much like the other art pieces TellTale has provided, connects you to the character. It makes you gain opinions of these characters. It will make you yell 'GOD DAMMIT (character) YOU FRIGGEN DID IT AGAIN!!!' It will make you say 'Dayum that was pretty bad@$$,' and best of all, it will make you frustrated. It will make you  FEEL  like you aren't under the boot of the White hills.  At the time that I am writing this, episode 6 has not come out yet. Episode 5 made me cry for the first time in years. Anyone who says your choices don't affect the game is wrong. The game forces you to make decisions you never thought you would have to make before in only just a few seconds. Those decisions resonate with you for weeks. Those decisions will ♥♥♥♥ you off too. It will make you think through the logic of the game. It will make you think 'They could have just shoved a sword in the chain and both ran through the gate!' or 'Oh my god when chapter 6 comes out I will friggen torture the Whitehills to death.'  I think its the TellTale way. Introduce, bond, eliminate. Lee, for example. They introduced you to his past, created a bond between the player and him, and ... well... spoiler alert.",1
Literally Saints Row 3 but with superpowers. Better in Coop than in single player.,1
"Armello is a very fun game, some strategy, some luck as you would expect from a game like this. Only issue is there is a very long wait time for online matches. If people start playing again will be a much more fun option.",1
Pure awesome sauce!  Takes me back to the days of Supercars on my Amiga 500!  A great mix of skill with insanity,1
"Loved this game when it originally released, having a great time revisiting this world.  It should be noted that the backgrounds, animations, and cutscenes didn't get much update. This is a classic title, and looks like it. But don't let that stop you from playing this game.   It's a fantastic and funny adventure",1
"Had my eye on this for a while. Looked interesting enough so I picked it up on sale. Little did I know. I stayed up way too late several times thinking to myself, 'just one more game...' Not sure if I'll go back through it again, but its definitely a great game and worth at least one playthrough.   JUST ONE MORE GAME.  Sleep Deprivation Simulator 10/10",1
This game is more fun than Universe Sandbox. The side quests are very tough as well :),1

Good game killed by its own devs,-1
 Early Access Review,-1
"Turn 270. Been stealing, pillaging, and keeping to the shadows like any good Forgotten. I'm making a crapton of gold. So much so that I can forseeably pull off a diplomatic victory in a few turns. My people await in anticipation. I hit the 'next turn' button:  ROVING CLANS WIN AN ECONOMIC VICTORY.  All my dreams, all my hopes for my people, gone.   The worst thing was, this was only on newbie difficutly...  Ok, so honestly, this game ROCKS. I'm a fan of games like this generally, played some 500 hours or more on the civ series, and played games like AOW3 too. I've never seen a game quite like this though. It's like they took their last game, Endless Space (which I have not played), and said: 'hmm, lets see what a fantasy version of this would look like.' That game is Endless Legend.  The art style first and foremost, is phenomenal. Everything looks and sounds GORGEOUS. I enjoyed just zooming in and out to survey my growing city. The music is moving and beautiful, and a welcome break from the typical epic soundtrack sound that permeates fantasy games. Also, THE FACTIONS!!! From the suitably dead but noble Broken Lords, to the vibrant Roving Clans, this game has diversity, an important thing in our PC culture. But seriously, all the factions are hugely different, and I've barely scraped the surface.  The gameplay is difficult, maybe too difficult, as I found myself getting stomped on newbie difficulty. However, there's a lot to learn, and I can admit that. There's intrigue (much better than Civ 5's version), amazing diplomacy, and a lot of fun quests that really flesh out the game. The only thing I found annoying was the combat, which I autoresolved most of the time.   Overall, this game is fantastic. I'll definitely be addicted to this game for quite some time.",1
i hate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is fine i gotta make a posititve review to support it,1
"Wins the prize for catchiest intro / credits music EVER  Difficult, fun, cheats like hell! XD love it  Moar puns than you could possibly imagine possible, we are entering the black hole alternate dimention of extreme PUNishment  Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen~ter the PUN~geon. ♪",1
"It's been a while since ive played it, but I think this together with age of empires will be my all time favorite games, the way the mixture between strategy and a form of rpg/dungeon crawler thing this game ended up to be just makes it amazing for me, if you screw up here with hardmode you can really screw yourself up if you save over other files like me but that makes the nostalgia even better. One of the best games ever released in my opinion.",1
"I first saw this game one or two days before its release, since I've always enjoyed games with beautiful music and absorbing stories, the love was instant. Usually a walking simulator is heavily relied on the script and the conversations of the characters, because unlike other games such as a First Person Shooter or an RPG, the only way of telling stories is through those conversations you will be having and it's highly possible that it is also the only experience of gamepaly in the whole process. You won't be dashing crazy, chopping down hollows or darkspawns or the whatever-the-name-is bad people, the only thing you can do is walking around, listening to people, and with a bit of luck, solving problems. Sounds boring, no? It's quite the opposite.  After finishing the game I couldn't help but trying to remember every touching moment and difficult choices I encountered. As Henry, who was not so lucky in his 'old' life, we were able to explore a beautiful forest and experience the life as a firewatch. Then this runaway turned out to be quite eventful. The only person you can talk to in the game is a woman called Delilah, she's also Henry's supervisor. As the story progressed, I found myself becoming more and more attached to her, emotionally, even if I could only listen to her voice through a walkie-talkie. The disappearance of the young girls, the dilemma, the 'June Fire', all these things added to the determination to not having her harmed. It's just like Scarlett Johansson in the movie  Her . She played as a self-aware AI and only by her voice, yet leaving an unforgettable impression. And in the final part of the game, Henry and Delilah discovered a shocking secret lying in the forest that beneath this peaceful look, someone was trying to take advantage of them and hide something that was meant to be known. Delilah brought him comfort every time when he needed it.   This is not only a story about watching over the forest, but also a modern life simulator in a more natural way. It's beautiful, insightful and unforgettable. Shame we couldn't see Delilah in person, hopefully she'll finally move in with Henry at the Boulder, as all of us would tell her in her very own Firewatch. ",1

"Fun, polished, well-thought out and addictive. If you haven't played this already, you're doing yourself a massive dis-service.",1
The ♥♥♥♥♥iest shooter game IN THE WORLD.,-1
"I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it is a short game and you can tell where some places are not as well done as others. It is an 'open' (still fairly linear) world, and I enjoyed seeing the beauty in different places. I liked the story, which is what kept me compelled to keep playing. This game is not for everyone. There are parts where the game can really get a hiccup, especially for people that aren't very patient. I decided to jump off one of the lifts to get an item faster, ony to have the lift stop where I jumped off. I needed the lift to complete part of my mission and I couldn't jump to it, even starting from last checkpoint wouldn't reset it. I had to close out the game to fix it. You sometimes will be warped to different places after cut scenes without any explanation on how you got there. That was more of a personal annoyance than a flaw. I enjoyed trying to get the entire backstory as to why the planet was the way it was.   TL:DR - I recommend it if you can look past it's flaws and just enjoy it for what it is.",1
This game is the best one I have played so far!!!!!  I rate it 11/10,1
This Game is legendary well worth the appriase.,1
"Prototype 2 is a sequel to Prototype and in my opinion it is better and more beautiful than the 1st. The pc port is kinda meh and the reason why I say this is because I got a real huge bug that lets me play for 15 to 20 minutes and then it starts to stutter and lag and it won't stop and then it just crashes and for some reason it won't go away. I've done everything possible and it is still unplayable. Rating for the game (without bug 9/10), (with bug 2/10).",1
  Wow thats is great,1
"Made me nostalgia about the old Space Empire games, so buy this, and its multiplayer",1
"I like this game, when this free!",1
"Please buy this game with caution! I found it to be a great game, indepth gameplay, only bad part was it feels very 'ant farm'. You place buildings in the world, operate them an watch them churn out dollars, to buy more buisness and repeat etc etc etc. I give it a 7 out of 10. Reason for a cautious buy is it still suffers from crashes, the Guild3 will be here in 2016 anyways so save your pennys for that!",1
"(This title was gifted by Zaraki Snakenoman. Thanks for all the support, man. :) )   Aurora Nights  is an astrological 'game' about sight-seeing. I use the term 'game' loosely as it's really more of an educational game about constellations' backstories while also acting as a 'Connect the dots' game. The music also has a pretty nice, ambient song that plays while you play.  There's honestly not much to tell about this game. The only real issues you may have may include the following:    Title screen and intro text are not suited for fullscreen    Star Map may not work properly with your window as you may only see a border area of a constellation    Typos in the encyclopedia    A price ($1) that does not match what you're getting (A title that can be finished in 30 minutes)   Now, it's a nice title that I would recommend for far less than asking price ($1). To be perfectly honest, it feels like a free title, so wait for a sale if you feel you must nab this one. At least at a discount, you will get 3 card drops that may help you get some money back on the Steam market.  5/10 Nicely done, but not worth the asking price.",1
"A fun game with some interesting tweaks to the 'minecraft in 2D' model, with bosses and goals being a very fun way to keep the game interesting. Can be a bit repetitive at times but nothing that is unique to this genre.",1

"It's a grat game and an awesome time pass. Best if played with friends, I play it often with my friends and it's very fun, Plus if you have this game on your android or iOS that just adds to the fun more, making it more addictive than it already is. Everyone who like decent arcade game and wants to have fun with friends and is a Comic fan should try this game.",1
It's a mountain. I don't know what you expected.,1

I LOVE THE GAME ,1
"Fix the Swing Bar Lag-Jumping.......This is My main issue with this game!!!! If the Devs fix this problem 1st i promise you will have more good reveiws and people making purchases. As for the prices being too high to purchase stuff, yes i agree and the platnium thing should be completely taken out of the game,, just use gold whether its 1k gold or 1 mil gold. For example if i put in 2000 hrs into this game playing matches and saving my gold i say i should be able to buy the same club as someone that put in 10 hours playing the game but made a purchase of X amount, just saying 'reward your loyal players regardless if they make purchases' I will say i have not spent anything on this game yet and wont till they fix the 'swing Bar Lag problem' However when i do manage to not get a laggy game i can hold my own and do pretty dam well. Other than that its a great game offers multi player, chat window, graphics are not bad, and offers a challenge. On a scale 1- 10 i rate this game a 7 and would be an 8 if they fix the lag issue...However, i am giving a thumbs Down until the lag issue is fixed because IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. Fix the lag and i will give a thumbs up and rate at an 8....",-1
I never thought it would be so fun to hit a ball with a car.,1
"Pretty darn good.  The strategy is excellent, the F2P is very nice, the arenas are 'build your own deck' so it's even, not who paid the most. Mainly just needs more players.  A couple of things need to get fixed:  1) The units on the board move and fire great. The click and drag of new units doesn't work all that well, and you may find units in the bottom row when they should be in the middle. Theres no reason for them to use a different style to get on the board than to move on the board.  2) Needs to have speeds and autofinish turns. It highlights the units/cards you can play (which is really handy), but if there's nothing you can do it still makes you click end turn. No reason you shouldn't be able to make that automatic. In addition, it needs to have at least three speeds- one where the opponent's turn is almost instantaneous, the current one, and one where when it shows you an opponent's card you haveto click on it to make it vanish. There's some nasty cards out there, and it can be difficult to see what's going on.  As a whole, a whole lot of fun.",1
"In my opinion, the Dark Descent may have been the more terrifying of the two games, but Machine for Pigs told the better story. The community following for this series seems to overlook the story of either game and instead compares the levels of how 'scary' the overall experience is, which I think is a poor way to judge this game. Sure it has the name 'Amnesia' in the title and we may attribute that title to a 'scary game', but I think this is overlooking greater factors in what makes this series unique.  I liked the Dark Descent as the scary, immersive, and atmospheric game that it was, but I do believe it fell short on the story. A Machine for Pigs was not, as disappointing as it was for some people, not nearly as scary as it's predecessor. However, in my time with it I found the game to be just as immersive as the first and it told a much better story than Dark Descent did. This game is not flawless, keep in mind. It is made by a different team than the one behind Dark Descent, and as a result it's more likely than not they did not use the game engine to it's full potential. A Machine for Pigs is not the most well optimized game, suffering from frequent frame drops and screen tearing issues despite having Vsync enabled. I run a GTX 970 and an FX8350 and I was unable to get a stable 60FPS unless I played on the preset 'medium' graphics setting.  To sum up what I liked and disliked about the game, though: PROS: 1) Monsters patrol areas instead of teleporting in and out of the map. Sure, a majority of the encounters ARE scripted, but unlike in Dark Descent if you do happen to die the monster WILL still be there when you load back in.  2) This game has phenomenal and immersive sound design. Best played alone and with headphones.  3) The game doesn't hold your hand through the last hour of the game like the Dark Descent did with Agrippa.  4) There were no plot holes in this story that I was able to pick up on.  5) Removal of the inventory screen, Part 1. Throughout my playthrough of the first Amnesia I must have collected atleast thirty tinderboxes that I never felt the need to use.  CONS: 1) Poorly optimized, screen tearing, frame drops, and I did encounter a glitch where an object I needed for a puzzle got stuck halfway through a wall.  2) Lack of interaction with the world. There are so many locked doors that you can interact with that serve no purpose, but meanwhile the only objects that Mandus CAN interact with are chairs and items needed to solve a puzzle.  3) Removal of the inventory screen, Part 2: Mandus's lantern never shuts off and he regenerates health. Along with this, in the Dark Descent there were items you would acquire from earlier parts in the game you find uses for later on. In Machine for Pigs, there's no need for an inventory screen because any item you need for a puzzle will be in the general vicinity.  4) Removal of the sanity meter. I can understand Mandus possibly not being afraid of the dark like Daniel was, but if I saw a deformed man pig hybrid patrolling an area I would get spooked by it.   5) The game is short. Even shorter than Dark Descent. Like 4-5 hours tops.  Overall, I did like the game for it's story but was slightly put off by the lack of puzzles and the poor optimization. I would give it a 7/10, and I would only recommend buying it during a sale.",1
"Terrible animations, bland sound and game mechanics which are neither deep enough to be enjoyable/skillful nor simple enough to be understandable. The tutorial is pretty bad, and does not explain anything useful that one couldn't work out through normal play. The parry system isn't very clear either. Most of the time it's impossible to tell what's going on, it feels extremely mindless and the actual depth and teamwork seems non-existent. This is a very lazily designed game by the seems of it, and is anything but satisfying to play. If you want something that's not gimmicky, try a proper fighting game, not this garbage.",-1
this game did not work when I bought it. It would load SocialClub very well but then when it attempted to load the game it just said that it had stopped working and then I had to close the program. However it might just be because that my laptop cant handle it and if you have a particually beefy computer then it might work but I am not shure.,-1
"At its current state, the game is nearly unplayable for me. There are some issues like the problem with the mouse sensitivity (or is it mouse acceleration?). And I somehow managed to fall under the bridge due to some bug or a glitch, not to mention the graphical issue as well. I personally wouldn't recommend it until the developer fix those issues.",-1
"While being called 'HD' and being a faithful remake of Age of Empires 2. It really just seems more like Age of Empires 2 with a tiny bit of extra code to integrate with Steam. I would have liked to have seen the textures etc to be vastly improved over what it is.   If you think you'd still play Age of Empires 2, get it, but otherwise I wouldn't bother as it is not an improvement.",-1
Ridiculously difficult to the point of frustration. I'd pick it up again if the mechanics are balanced.,-1
Pros : -- Pretty well made story -- Beautiful art style -- Lots of Scenes -- A fair challenge  Cons : -- None at all,1
"It's okay but please add a few things like a scope for weapons, Knifes and better Mouse controls.",1
"While sure very interesting concept, not sure that it is worth the gigantic price. The game is very simple and I wouldn't say rewarding. It present the capitalism in all it's brutality and I am not sure if that is very entertaining.",-1

"IMPORTANT NOTICE. STOP AND READ BEFORE YOU BUY.   This game uses Games for Windows Live, a terrible DRM that downloads automatically and boots up when you start the game. Games for Windows Live is dying in the near future, meaning this game could become unplayable. It might work fine, but even so, Games for Windows Live is terrible, get the game after it dies if you can.  The only reason I recommend this game is because it IS good, GfWL nearly killed it for me as it took nearly an hour to trudge through all the menus.   As far as the game goes, it's very linear, there are no branching pathes or choices, don't buy this thinking you're getting the next skyrim. Don't get it for the story either, the devs get it out of the way as quickly as possible for the maximum amount of shooting. Story isn't bad, there's just not alot to it. It also ends on a cliffhanger, and there dosen't seem to be a sequel planned.  Get this game for the shooting, because even though it's so linear, it has some of the most fast paced, fun shooting of any fps i've played in a long while.  Get this game to pull a guy 30 yards away from you with your laser whip, only to kick him into a cactus. Get this game to use your shotgun to kill 10+ dudes with a wave of hellfire. Get this game to snipe a dude in the balls whilst he's flying through the air. But most importantly, get this game when it's on sale. Recommended, but not for full price, as it is very short.",1

Really Great Game. Story line was awesome and gameplay seemed fresh for an FPS game. I would highly recommend it if you have the money. 5/5,1
"Goat Simulator is fun, but in astupid fun kind of way. Now, I personally don't have a good enough computer and so I lag horribly, but I still struggle through the intense lag in order to play it. Goat Simulator is basically like one of those games that a group of friends made for fun, but it is still amazing. This game has comedy, great physics, great and immense controls, and endless possibilities despite the map being so small. The map includes a great many things for you to ♥♥♥♥ around with, including a castle with goat followers in it, a dried up pool with trampolines in it, a group of protesters, a goat version of Fight Club, a satanic ritual, a Zero Gravity Simulation area, a construction site, and even includes the office (which is actually just in a house) of the developers. What's more is that you can play an even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game than Flappy Bird called Flappy Goat. If you ask me, this game is totally worth the ten dollars. Buy it if you want hours upon hours of endless and stupid fun.",1
Actually a great game. You can easily spend hours of destroying cities only thinking you spend a couple of minutes.,1
Dressed up as a unicorn and cooked meth...   Nuff said,1

This is also recommended for those that want to fight what used to be their companion (not the Companion Cube). This is also also recommended for those that want more tests. (not to mention that multiplayer mode is very fun),1
"I would have to say, having read others reviews and having my own experience, i would not recommend this game. Im not saying the game itself is bad, i loved what little time i had to enjoy. however that said, it is a game plagued with problems for PC users. Multiplayer is effectively ruined by hackers/modders i saw hackers rampage on a server in the few minutes i had online, thats enough for me. single player just does not work and crashes after 5-10 mins. spent a day trying various fixes but to no avail. i dont intend on re-installing my whole system another time or re downloading 60 odd gigs of data several more times.  for those of you who can run this game, well done. im jelous, but im not wasting time on this.",-1
Overall I enjoyed my time with this game but it is quite short. The full price of $20 is frankly insane but it is worth it if you can get it for around $5.,1
doesnt work right. bought it had to jump thru a lot of hoops just to get it to run then found out that there is no controller support even though the game claims to have controller support. I feel cheated. this is the 2nd or 3rd game (darksiders being the other) that I had problems running on steam and that advertised something that it did not deliver. Im done.,-1
"This game has barely anyone playing. And its hard, like, really hard. Like the first 3 hours of gameplay for me I had a total of 5 kills. However, this game offers epic organic chases that no other game can offer as well as clutch fights to the death. If you can convince some friends to play this together, its a must have. Definitely recommend, PLEASE BUY, NEED MORE PEOPLE ON SERVERS!",1

"One of the best RPGs of all time.  The pacing is great, the plot is gripping, the dialogue is awesome (and often hilarious).   The graphics still hold up amazingly well for a now 17-year title and the sound effects are spot on. Music is subtle and atmospheric. Not memorable, but does a good job in seting the mood.  But what impresses me the most about this game is that it allows for both scripted experience and emergent experiences, as every situation can be remedied through a personally-selected mix of combat, stealth, dialogue.  While the game is not as much of a write-your-own as some other open-world games, it leans on the scripted content to create sequences &amp; events that are truly awesome.  Good luck in the wastes!",1

"'One of the scariest games of all time!' Yeah, sure, whatever man. Not even with the proper setting as the game tells you. (Headphones, dark room). The first 3 jump scares are indeed scary - after that, it get's annoying pretty fast. The story is solid and interesting, but I wouldn't call it 'One of the scariest games'. Bulls***.",-1

Fast, viceral, and fun as all hell (hehe I made a pun).  Note: Have no intention to play multiplayer. I'm just enjoying the campaign.",1

"Great game, has a nice little story and loads of content, coming with DOOM 3, the resurrection of evil DLC DOOM 1 and 2 and a new campiagn, The lost mission. The multiplayer may not be very popular but personaly I enjoy it and I play it quite a lot. The lighting is great. It can be quite scary, it makes an exellent horror game with spooky sound effects, turns and hallways. There will be demons hiding behind the next corner or behind a door making you feel like there will allways be enemys and loads of them. On the down side the multiplayer can be laggy if your not hosting, and it will be common for you to get high ping, like in the hundreds (if your not hosting). But all together it makes a great game and worth your money depending on what type of game you like. This comes with loads of content so it should keep you busy for a while. (7.6)",1
"A hash between a dating sim and a visual novel, Tokyo School Life was really a treat. The three characters are really memorable; Karin with her cocky exterior and a love for food and all things cute, Sakura who is a timid manga lover, and Aoi, a caring and thoughtful karate enthusiast. I loved the art style that was present in this, with a static background and the characters being alive and actually moving, whereas with a traditional visual novel, the backgrounds and characters are static. A lot of times I found myself laughing or cringing at characters, or even becoming concerned about characters. If you have the $15 to dish out on this visual novel, I highly suggest it. And if you have extra money, I also recommend the soundtrack. I still can't get the opening theme out of my head.",1

"Started a new game and immediately lost a fight after the very first move, resulting in me losing the game. In another try, told a lumberjack he'd smell like cheese and in return was offended by his wolf. He called me a snail, which made my team faint so hard that it resulted in me losing the game.  10/10 would lose again.",1
Really good fun and great to play with friends! GET IT NOW!!,1
Full of little things that still suprise me after hours of gameplay.,1
It's great. Take the original Sins (see what I did there?) and add more awesomeness.,1
"Well, I have never played a coaster game that has looked this good! It is so much fun to build and develop even the smallest detail in the parks.  The only problem is I have lost my computer to my 11 year old who can build things just as good as me!  There is so much content here you will easily get hours of gaming and I expect them to support this long after launch it is that good.  You like designing and developing theme parks this is for you!",1
"too broke to buy cs. download this. play it. play the hidden. play zombies. play multiplayer. have fun. reminds me of game i played, called Crossfire, when I was young 10/10 IGN.",1
Most fun I've had for a dollar since your mom.,1
"Race the sun: the game of woah, I almost crashed, WOAH, that was really close, CRAP, I CRASHED. You know those stars they put on top of trees at Christmas? those are your new best friend, and until you unlock them (don't worry, it's the very first thing you unlock), it is literally impossible to get past a certain point. Once you do, the true challenge of skill, daring, and by-the-seat-of-your-pantsery begins. The game is quite beautiful in a simple sort of way, especially if your computer isn't weird about rendering shadows like mine is. Another advantage to seeing the shadows is that you can see low objects when the sun is just barely higher than them, because otherwise, you'll probably crash. Well, specifically, you'd crash into the low object. You WILL crash, but if you hardly have time to see the thing you're crashing into, it feels kinda cheap. Anyway, get this game. If you want to wait for a sale, go ahead, but get this game eventually.",1
"Ok this game is the definition of simple mindless fun, be wary those who get motion sickness though. The simple controls and gameplay are excellent and the music is super catchy, and with the pice at 59 cents it is totally worth it.",1
worth every cent highly enjoyable game.,1
"Strong, replayable 4X game. The setting is an interesting take on human-meets-aliens sci-fi. Factions and titans are fun additions to the existing gameplay. Would definitely recommend.",1
Game Dev Tycoon is one of those games where you think that its gonna be boring and just another simple game but once you start playing you get hooked on the addictive type of gameplay. I was playing it whenever I was not in the mood for more hardcore and bigger games. It really made me think outside the box and try new and exciting combos. I love the wide amount of options this game gives you. I'd recommend it for casual players who like simple games. ,1
One of my favourite games on Steam :),1
I prefer thius game,1
"Excellent for playing with your friends online. The game concept is simple but the weapons, perks, scenarios, and bosses lend enough variety to make it interesting.",1
"Simple, yet fun. I've only had about an hour on it so far but I feel it was worth the purchase. It is quite a challenge to try to get your typing speed up to par in order to be successful.",1
"Item Confirmation Simulator 2015  How i play this game: 1. Install  2. Play 3. Open Armory 4. Accept an item that i bought for my friend (item not tradable bug) 5. Wait for 5 minutes, so i can write this review 6. Quit Game 7. Uninstall  Score : 9.5/10 (If i like this game, i will give 10/10)",1
Its not as bad as they say I mean look at this wonderful game named Voxelized...         YouTube™ Video:  Sam Cooke - Feel It [Live Version]&nbsp;,-1
"If you have friends to play this with, it's amazing. if you don't don't buy ;)",1
This action packed game is one of the best of it's kind.. why? BECAUSE SLIDING! it requires no real 'skill' to master and is therefore quick to master and the graphics requires no beast pc soanyone can play!,1
"This is one of my favorite games. While it can be hard at times, nothing is too dificult. The fact that you don't have to restart the level with every death is also a plus. The music is amazing, and incredibly relaxing. The only problem are the achievements, some of which are incredibly hard to get. Even so, definetly worth playing.",1
"Just Cause 2 is an amazing game, and the Multiplayer Mod creates a better expirence. Despite it being a Mod, it plays and feels like the single-player campaign, just with your friends doing whatever nonsense you please. Despite that, it stinks that it's not an actual part of Just Cause 2, and therefore it's not completely supported by Square Enix and Eidos. However, this is an amazing expirence with friends, grappling onto trees, hijaking planes, and heck, even flying a car into the air is fun.  Graphics: 8/10 Controls (Keyboard): 7/10 Controls (Xbox 360/PS3): 9/10 Sounds: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Fun Factor: 9/10  Average Result: 8/10  I recommend this game to play with friends, and maybe even join random servers to see what else you can do on this Multiplayer Mod.",1
positive suprised! :D,1
Love this game,1
i think the game should change the name to The Patience Simulator 2016,1
Fun I wished more people played it.,1
"This is the well-known BBF sequel which made many players reconsider what game to buy, all thank to Dice. I bought this game for almost 5 euros, when Summer Sale 2013 was going on. This game totally gave me another view upon FPS games, concerning graphics, physics, environment and so on. What is unique about this game is what DICE has been developing for good years&gt;FROSTBITE. A cool thing that makes a good interrelation between Cause and Effect(s). Look for some gameplays/playthrough on YouTube, you will get it easy.           YouTube™ Video:  Bad Company 2 - What We Lost/Gained (Battlefield Bad Company 2 Gameplay/Commentary)&nbsp;",1
"This game is simple and fun, I enjoye the beautiful back grounds with the great puzzels.",1
A beautiful turn based tactics game that stressed me out too much to keep playing.,1
fun easy and not real hard can get into the game easy and it has dragons so why not lol,1
"I don't recommend getting this for pc unless you have a controller to connect and use. It doesn't tell you the pc controls, only the xbox controls and some of the pc controls don't work.",-1
"Pretty good, need to play it more though!",1
"As a former med student I can say this really shows the potential of VR for teaching. Not all the graphics are correct (like Viruses bouncing around, but the anatomical exploration of the body is great. Highly recommended",1
"4,5/5. Atmospheric and terrifying. Gets less terrifying towards the end.",1
Overall its a pretty good game. definately quite a bit different from past RE games though. Not really much survival to it as the game throws tons of ammo at you. Which is quite necessary by the end of the game because alot of the difficulty comes from increased enemy numbers. By the end of the game i felt like I was playing Serious Sam not Resident Evil. Overall i would definately say it is worth a try just for the co-op but unless you realy have to have it right now you might want to wait for a price drop or sale.,1
lol i have no idea about the game just downloading it,1
"Dark Souls is a tough game, there is no doubt about that. The difference between being hard for the sake of being hard and being challenging by testing and respecting the player is more than just semantics. Dark Souls is the latter. Every boss challenges you to think about your tactics and counter-moves. You will die, but with each death you gain that much more insight. Think of it like the movie, Edge of Tomorrow. With each death, you learn, adapt, and ultimately triumph.  The story is told mostly through the environment and item descriptions. You can blindly play through the entire game without grasping the intricate nuiances between the various characters in the game or uncovering their own motivations for doing the things that they do. This is to both the game and the player's benefit. The lore is there for those who search for it, but it never tries to bash your head with exposition like many other games do. The minus would be that players who rush through will never catch on to the amazing backstory of sacrifice and betrayal.  The controls leave a bit to be desired, as at times my controller had some weird problems, like taking certain actions despite the fact that I did not press the button. However, these instances were few and far between and the controls were workable. Having a controller is essential for this game. You simply can not mash your mouse buttons or keyboard to win fights.   The DLC, Artorias of the Abyss, (which comes with this edition) is a great addition to the original game. Completely optional, it dives more into the lore behind the great knight, Artorias. As an owner of the PS3 version who did not pick this DLC up when it was released on the console, it was a real pleasure to play through it.  Dark Souls is an excellent game and I would highly recommend it. Yes, the game is difficult, but it is a good sort of difficult that makes you smile when you finally defeat that boss that killed you dozens of times prior. While there are some relatively cheap bosses, the game is never unwinnable.",1
"Sadly I can't say much about this game, it looks great from the trailer and the videos I have seen. But unfortunately I can't login with my steam account. I still give it a positive because I know it's an amazing game, only the community needs to grow.",1
i love this game,1
"Decent game, if you can get on a server without all the racist cowards",-1
I am going to keep this simple. By reading reviews i though this would be a good fun sim. After only a few hours its just repeating the same repairs over and over again. It gets very boring very quick.,-1
10/10 Would soundtrack again.,1
"Great game! As some may know, it started out as a successful Half Life 2 mod that later turned into it's own game. It's squad based gameplay is riveting. It has a more realistic approach compared to similar games such as CS:GO. And with a superb workshop with high quality submitters that actually listen to what players say about their content, what is there to hate? And with an abundance of servers, there's always a match.   However, this game does glitch out sometimes and may run slow or may not work. For instance, when I purchased this game on sale, the game did not work. After numerous downloads and with no help from the forums, I was left with a broken game. But an update had occured and the game finally worked after months of gathering dust in my library. This is a thrilling FPS, worth a try if you enjoy realism and competetive shooters!",1
"The best city simulator that is out there at the moment. It has it's own flaws of course, but still a game which is easy to lose yourself into",1
You Gotta Play It!!!!!,1
"After playing Killing Floor for hundreds of hours, finishing most of the maps for 50 times, you would expect you saw everything in a Coop vs. AI game.  But this game still amazes me, i still experience surprises and moments where the temperature rises and you want to jump up from your chair because you are so thrilled.  Moments where you walk around a corner, thinking you leave all enemies behind, and suddenly running into a fat Fleshpound still make this game an entertaining masterpiece of video game design.  In terms of longevity this game surpasses all other coop games and most of the competitive games i played so far.  Sure, this game takes some time to show off its full potential, you need to learn which class suits your play style, how the different Zeds react to your fire, which weapons are effective against which enemy and so on.  But if you take your time, you are rewarded with complex game mechanics that compliment teamwork, map knowledge and cleverness so much that you cannot help but enjoy Killing Floor.  'I came for the blood, but I stayed for the fun'",1
Great game if your willing to put hours apon hours on hold to complete one of the larger maps. you will spend days eating and sleeping this game to keep it fresh in your head as you plan what you will do in hours to come.,1
10/10 Loved the game.  - Soundtrack the matched all situations - Really good story - User friendly control - Amazing character development  I was sad that all the endings made me sad and made me have trouble sleeping at night. Other than that AMAZING I would pay for a game like this.,1
Tries to be Supreme Commander. It failed.,-1
"Very addictive game, not for a lighthearted player though. I have spent many hours on this game, and I believe I've only been re-elected twice, and never more than one term... So needless to say this game is VERY Hard!!!",1
1 word: epic ,1
"Yes, yes, 100x yes. This is probably the best indie game I've ever played in my life. Story was fun and thought provoking, the characters were funny and interesting and the gameplay was challenging. Plus, the soundtrack is worth the $10 bucks alone. Go get eett, naow.",1
"love this game man, ♥♥♥♥ me goood",1
"Well i cant get rid of my starter edition to buy the 50% standard edition, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",1
"Just epic , buy it . All im hoping for is some online co-op / pvp and more everything ; I want more ...",1
"This is Joe Danger 2, the sequel to Joe Danger, a very good 2D stunt racer by Hello Games, an independent developer known for making the Joe Danger games. And only the Joe Danger games. Nothing else. Stop talking now. Look, you can do flips and collect stuff!",1
"its not a game, its a simulator very worth to buy tons of free mod ",1
"Unmechanical is good. It's a puzzle game in the form of a linear adventure. This style of game has been done many times before and it's not very original, but it was still fun to play. The only way to interact with objects is a gravity beam used to carry objects and activate switches. The puzzles weren't too difficult, but some did stump me for a minute. The graphics are pretty and the environments were always fun to look at. It took me about four hours to finish the game. I recommend Unmechanical.",1
"For the price of this game, its amazing i got this game for under a dollar and i had a good time playing it. i would recommend this game for sure. 10/10",1
"I don't know if I'd be willing to pay the full $14.99 for this game, but it falls to a mere $2.49-ish during every sale - a price which makes it unreasonable not to have this game in your library. It's your average open world game with rather nice detail. There's tons to see, tons to do, and tons of space. Personally, I have fun playing this game because of the raw destruction. A large part of the game revolves around blowing up structures while running and gunning past waves of enemies, which is a great way to blow off some steam or waste your time.   However, all of this destruction quickly becomes dry and very repetitive. After uprgading your weapons, the enemies stand no chance, even on the highest difficulty, and their AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times. My biggest complaint with this game is the story, however. It is utter crap. It was very poorly designed and the cutscenes nauseated me. I just started skipping them, which I almost never do, as the voice acting is garbage and the lips are not synced at all. To be honest, the only reason I finished the main storyline was for achievements.  Overall, I'd give this game a letter grade of B-. Perhaps that is a generous grade, but I think it's fair. I do enjoy playing the game very much, even if it is repetitive and the story is worthless. I recommend buying it with your leftover savings during a steam sale for maximum satisfaction.",1
"A game that does the source material justice; an exciting and emotional tale of intrigue, violence, misery and hope. It feels just like the HBO series come to life. Well worth it.",1
"I learned the weaknesses of a school IT Dept, how to remotely disable a pro-assisted suicide patient's pacemaker, and the Colonel's 11 secret herbs and spices, all through linux-based terminal commands! Fantastic work, lads.",1
"First of all, it's not a hard game. Second, it's a zombie game (who would have thought). And third, it is a 3D sidescroller. Confused? No need for it. You play in a typical sidescroller manner, embedded in a 3D environment. And that's visually appealing, even if the game lacks of detailed graphic settings. No wonder, it's a console port. And you notice it, unfortunately. Audio errors during cutscenes (in the forums you'll find possible solutions) and clunky controls. The latter is, in some sections where you have to react fast, extremely annoying and really inexcusable for a sidescroller. You can rebind the keys, but the problem here are the character animations. They look good, but they also get you in trouble if timing is necessary. But there are also good sides. As I said, the visual style is appealing, the PC requirements are not very high and you can have quite a few hours of fun. All in all, it could be worse. But it could also be much better if they would have invested a little more work into the PC version. If it's on sale you can give it a try. That's what I did.",1
"All I have to say is, I love Scholastic book orders! (That is where I saw the game for the first time in 4th grade) Probably 100 hours on this game prior to getting it for steam. Is it my favorite game of all time? YES! Not just if your an RTS fan, If you like video games, GET THIS GAME! I can't say anything bad about this game except not enough people play it anymore!  EDIT: If you want to play this game online, look into a program called forged alliance forever. It's a large growing community of sup com players, full of mods and other cool game modes. Just check it out, ton of fun.",1

"I've been running this through wine - specifically playonlinux using 1.7.53-steam_crossoverhack. It works well although the FPS is not great but definitely playable. Increasing/decreasing graphics options does not change the FPS so you can max everything out without worrying about performance.   The game itself is really fun. I'm coming from BL2 and TPS so it is definitely a step backwards but remains a great game. Like all the borderlands games it is built on loot and skills which are plentiful. Really the most frustrating part is not have a mini-map which makes me keep opening up the map for directions.   I really like the Borderlands universe and it is fun exploring this planet again. The opening is set in Fyrestone which is also playable in BL2, only in BL2 it ceased to be an abandoned Dahl village and was instead turned into a post apocalyptic environmental disaster by Hyperion. The game also gives insight to many of the characters you run into in the later games.  Overall, highly recommend it to Borderlands fans and if you are a Linux user it works fine with wine. If you are new to Borderlands it is probably best to start with Borderlands 2.",1

"I have never heard of the Divinity series before but after this game, I believe I'm going to try my hand out on more of them. I just bought the Divinity Anthology and I am currently waiting for it to come in the mail. Divinity: Dragon Commander was enjoyable. This is the first time I've ever seen a strategy game like this. It has included all of my faviorte elements of games I enjoyed today, such as Mass Effect, Risk, the Total War series, and put them together into one big pot. The RTS battles were a bit difficult though, even on casual. With the enemy troops constantly zerg rushing, camera controls being awful, and with not the best computer out there, I found the RTS battles extremely difficult, so I avoided them during the campaign part of the game. The controls in RTS will probably take some time getting use to, especially for new players playing RTS games for the first time. Just using the turtorial alone to get a feel of the game isn't enough, you'll need to pratice a bit with skirmish battles., that and the tutorial is very lacking. I wish they included much more useful tips in it.  Playing as a dragon with a jet pack is really fun in the RTS battles, my only complaint is how difficult it is to handle your troops and micro manage as a dragon. Not to mention selecting them is a bit difficult. I died quite a few times when I attempting to get the hang of things. The dragon can be a life savor though if you're inexperience. Overall, I enjoyed the Risk like board in the campaign mode, and I really enjoyed the politics and how it affected your army, gold, and troop morale. I attempted to play the game as a good character and it was difficult having to pick the higher road when in return you had to sacrifice resources. Sometimes, the high road can hit you badly with its outcomes. This is perhaps the first time I've seen a stratagey game with rpg elements, I really enjoyed the different characters and their personalities. It's important to interact with your generals as much as you can, seeing as finishing their stories will improve your chances on the battle field. I didn't realize unil the end of Act II that your actions can affect the personality changes in your generals, and that there is more than one ending for them, and the princessess that you can marry which makes the replay value in this game high, seeing as the choices you make can lead to different outcomes. With the Imperial pack, there is a chart/diagram that can show you the different outcomes for each character, not to mention some behind the scene stuff, concept rp, and a dlc.  I highly recommend this game for others; this is something refreshing in the strategy genre. There were a few things that I had quirks about, like the rewarding for zerg rushing, how insanely powerful your dragon can become when maxed out and control issues, but overall, I believe the good parts of the game out weigh the bad part. I wouldn't give it a ten out of ten, but it's a lovely game to have in your library. Hopefully, the other Divinity games will be too. For certain, I'll have to make a guide and indepth review for this game in the future.",1

"Amazing soundtracks  Gorgeous graphics   I like the storytelling , coulda been a bit longer. But since you dont have all the economic means i guess its doable.   Would gladly pay 5 bucks for this game  8.5/10   Its free lol go ahead and try it guys",1
What i wouldnt give to re-expirience this game again. that is how good this game is it makes you wish to wipe your memory and go through its torment once more to feel that same sence of achievement again when you beat those bosses.,1
"Game is extremely fun, and also has multiplayer capabilities, and is a sandbox style game for less intense gamers, making it a well rounded game for just $9.99!",1
"God damn I love this game and series but I just can't give it a positive review until FROM realizes that they need to actually improve what is making a masterpiece extremely unpleasant. Like, I don't even know where to start or end.  Nerfing sorceries/miracles and pretty much halfing the amount of spells in the game is a severe blow to this game's class versatility, which was a high point in past games. Playing a magic-user is completely pointless if you want to do any PvP unless you're REALLY good and it's not that reliable in PvE either until late-game (usually around SL 70+), and the miracles in the game are almost entirely pointless save for a few miracles like   Darkmoon Blade, Tears of Denial and the Med/Great Heals  .    Pyromancies still kick ♥♥♥ though    Another point of frustration is how broken and unbalanced certain weapons/armours are and the total lack of attention paid to them. While FROM is 'adjusting efficiencies' (which is already a very vague statement) of perfectly functional and balanced weapons and armour they are completely ignoring the very real scourge of   Dark Sword and Estoc   and broken   read: entirely functional   poise. This was something that they had actually addressed very quickly in Dark Souls II regarding the Curved Painting Guardian sword, which had quite the broken parry.  I'm not even going into how miffed I am with the removal of power-stancing, which was one of the fanbase's favourite parts of Dark Souls II  It seems like FROM is bloated on their cash cow and now sees no point in fixing the negative aspect of what was meant to be the cherry on top of the fantastic Souls series. I understand that Miyazaki and the squad have a 'do whatever' philosophy regarding how they make their games but there's a difference between making the game you want and arguably breaking a game just for fun/leaving it broken and watching the fans rage.  Meanwhile I bought this game and have so much time on it because I can't bring myself to dislike it since it's still an extremely enjoyable game. It's beautiful to look at, the characters are as fleshed out and three dimensional as their progenitors (save for a few exceptions), and as always the story is increasingly depressing and heartbreaking as you find out more about what plagues the land of Lothric, its royal family, and the Lords of Cinder.",-1

"I bought this in the sale and got the sequel with it, all for a very affordable £5. If I paid more, I would have been pretty disappointed, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.  It's actually very fun with friends, and the graphics and sounds are decent. The plot is...sub par, but of course the plot isn't really important in a game like this. Also, the game does seem poorly optimised and will often lag for no apparent reason.   Imagine Left 4 Dead, WW2 Style with tons of Nazi Zombies. In third person. That pretty much sums this game up. Oh, and the kill cam is AWESOME. Watch in full detail how you kill your enemies.  Should you buy it? Definitely yes, but only if it is cheap.",1
this game is very cool.,1
Very different from anything I've played before!,1
The best uruk killing simulator out there!,1
Refunded this game and bought Witcher3 at almost same price  Greatest choice in my life  10/10 refund simulator,-1
Great suite. So many possibilites! I also purchased a digital drawing pad for about $45 and it works great with it. Highly recommend!,1

"I downloaded this game just so I could leave a review. I played this back on xbox 360, and purchased the vip pack, only to have the game shut down less than a year later and no refunds...I liked this game a lot, but decided to basically boycot against it untill now, though I still hate the fact of what happened, I'm still gonna give it another try, all this review is saying is be carefull if you decide to buy stuff here....also during play i've come to realize the skins (which was the best part of the packs imo) are still available, and much cheaper.",1
Perfect for multiple monitors and made even better when combined with mouse macros. 10/10 would recommend.,1
"Everything about this game, is utterly perfect. The plot, the graphics, the characters, etc 10/10 I recommend that you purchase this masterpiece.",1
"This game has a lot of very funny moments. the first 2 hours are amazing, but towards the end it starts to get a bit boring with all the 'stealth' missions.  I used a Xbox 360 Controller, tried using keyboard and mouse but it didn't really work. In my opinion it is well worth the $12 (or $15 after 6th of February).",1
Love it still need improvement,1

"The game is well designed, even when some rules are kinda tricky to understand, the misions are fun to do, specially trying to get the achievements. The art is great and imo one of the strongest points. the music is nice, but kinda distracting if you end turns fast. overall is a good game.",1
This game can be summed up with this line 'That's how I lost my medical license',1
"10/10 PERFECT SCORE Undertale. What a game... no, an experience..... this is. Undertale is the work of genius by Toby Fox with the support of Kickstarter and adoring fans. Previously, Fox was known for his Earthbound Halloween Hack and his work with the Homestuck comics. It is quite clear that Undertale takes much inspiration from the Earthbound (Mother in Japan) series, but not directly ripping it off. To my understanding, this game was also made in RPG Maker, which really goes to show just what that tool is capable of. The visual style is somewhere between NES and SNES graphically. I'd call it 12-bit. Every character from the main folks, to the smallest enemies (hOI!!!!) are loveable. The best way to describe the humor is by calling it 'dad jokes,' the kind that can be corny, but you're still laughing at them. Undertale will DEFINITELY elicit multiple playthroughs from players, as there are NUMEROUS endings dependent on your choices, and the True Ending is pretty tricky to get. The combat is actually optional! That's right, this is one RPG where nobody has to die! And it's how you can avoid these fights that really puts a spin on what we know from RPGs. It's goofy, it's fun, it's got its scary moments, and it WILL make you cry. There's also plenty of challenge for those who seek it, and you may regret seeking it out. This game really captures the charm Earthbound and Mother 3 carried. The kind that makes you happy to be playing, and really draws you in. The soundtrack is probably the best part of this AMAZING title. Every track carefully fits the scene (and even Toby's signature piece, Megalovania, which has appeared in every one of his major works thus far, is in here), and really brings forth the emotions you want to be feeling at that exact moment in time. Never before have I felt so engaged in a scene by the music alone! I downloaded the soundtrack as DLC and now listen to it in my car daily, and remembering where the music plays, letting the memories of my journey flow to me, it brings a smile to my face. Kids, adults, moms, dads, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, grandmothers, grandfathers, friends, family, everyone you know would love this game, and it's the first game to really win my heart over like this. I've never been so captivated by a game before, not like this. I am very very glad I was gifted this game. With that said, this gets the first ever score of 10/10 from me. It is the only game I have ever rated with a perfect score, as I typically do not believe in perfection in game design. But Undertale is, without a shadow of a doubt, my new favorite game of all-time. It is a masterpiece that Toby Fox will go down in history for, and that deserves Game of the Year in my opinion (Sorry Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain and Fallout 4, you just aren't as fun as this), and I sincerely doubt this will be leaving my heart anytime soon. If you haven't played this masterpiece yet, you are missing out on the first game of this year to get EVERYTHING about it right! Majora's Mask 3D was close, but this is right on the nose with how games SHOULD be, and it didn't need VR, motion controls, 3D, or stunning 3D graphics to pull it off. This is an absolute must-have for anyone who calls themselves a gamer, and trust me, you will not regret spending the extra $8 to get the soundtrack bundle!",1
"i played this game with tanner, chummy, spucko and myself and it was a bad time overall, we all got hurt. worst flash game ever",-1
Its...fun,1
"Story line is great and keeps you interested, Some bugs that I wish would be fixed. Also wish there were expansions available to purchase and download. Only played through once but plan to do so again with a different charecter.  Hope this franchise can stay alive!",1
best game for the steam controller,1
10/10... This was just the type of game I was looking for. It runs great on my low spec laptop.,1
A very good game. The story was great! Love the graphics!!  Worth the money too. :),1
"Such shooter, so amaze. Wow!",1
hm in my review id say this its a great game if you like a slow pace game sure the color of the worlds become the same the hype was overselled the living worlds arent quite full of life the space battles are furstarting the multiplayer aspect is noexistent yet it is so gamedevs arent sure if they want friends playing toghter but when you play it you see why 2 or more playing toghter would be pointless with the amount of combat and not being able to build bases and such that is unavabile but in all its a ok game is it the best no is it bad no its meh but for what ive seen so far theres more that could be done and i see room for improvement in my opinion if you want to buy wait till it goes on sale if you dont want to wait be my guest by the game see if it intrest you but dont buy have problems with and then hate it cause lets face it your to lazy to go watch a video or go read about how its fairing on ratings for it so buy it dont just well go for it if its your cup of tea good sir/madam in ending Xx_BURRITOAMIGO_xX,1
"Love original worlds like isometric Fallout games? Love managing fighting critters, like Pokemon? Love the feeling you got clearing out the 'fog of war' maps in the original Warcraft games? Love scifi that's not lasers, and fantasy that's not medieval? Then you're gonna love Geneforge. Tons o' content, lots of skills to play with, and your own fire-breathing velociraptor named 'Shrieksy'. What more could a gamer ask for?",1
"1 piece of advice: Find an outfit, or a regular group of friends to play with. This is a great game with absolutely massive fights. The only downside is trying to lone wolf it makes you feel fairly insignificant. You get a good group of people to play with, and there's no end to the fun you can have, whether it be silly shenanigans, or very competative, tactical play.",1

"After searching hours for a good hack and slash game to play, I came across grim dawn. After playing several hours I was like, 'why is this game so under the radar?!' Looking at top 5 or top 10 lists of the best and hack and slash games of 2016, Grim Dawn wasn't any of those lists. But I am so thankful I looked at the top selling hack and slashes on steam, because I have really enjoyed this game so far...",1

"The game was great, even though it only ran at about 15 FPS on my old computer on minimum. The game however, does suffer from a bad case of Uplay. I can't even play the game on my brand new, faster computer because I forgot my old Uplay account and I have already registered the games product key to my old computer, which now has a blown up motherboard. So even if I make a new Uplay account, the registration key won't work anymore. But the game was good while it lasted.",1
"This is the type of horror game you'd want to play when you're bored, it's late night and you have some friends over. I haven't played too much of it (as you can see), but from what I've seen from a friend and some YouTube videos it's pretty fun, especially multiplayer.  I would give it a 3/10 for singleplayer, and 6/10 for multiplayer.",1

"I can't believe I actually never wrote a review for this game!  This is probably one of my favorite games I play. It's so incredibly relaxing to just truck arround Europe, discovering places and trying to build your truck imperium.  I kinda want to tell more about this game, but I don't know what. I don't really have negative points about this game, it's just all positive! Buy it :)",1
Would be a good game if people was online and server wasn't empty. Graphics are cool movement is great but what I am rating this game on is mulitplayer which I enjoy the most. Dead game guys.,-1

"If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be in the movies with a real killer chasing you, and having incapable friends, family, or teammates, this is the game for you. Be prepared to love the game but hate every person you play with. The player base is my only flaw with this game, everyone you get paired with has a mental illness from the amount of times their parents tried to drown them, 10/10 do not trust anyone your not speaking directly too. Because even when you think maybe I will give this person a chance, maybe they will be a great teammate, they will fail you. This game is why i have trust issues.",1

Also if you buy the game buy it in a bundle with western fronts or the U.S. it allows for better gameplay, campain is intresting and challenging enough. I highly recomend this game to all people who love history and world war 2.",1

"Rogue Legacy is an excellent game, combining classic action-platforming with roguelike game elements. After each death you can restart the game with a descendant of your previous character. The level is a randomly generated after each new start.",1
"7/10    This game is interesting because of it's nemisis system. This is a system where you kill the toughest enemies (warchiefs) and they will be replaced by captins. Normal generic enemies are then promoted to captins. Therefore enemies and bosses get replaced endlessly. This is a feature I really liked about the game.   The game play feels as though someone mixed the Assassins Creed series with the Batman: Arkham series. AC free-running and Arkham-like combat. This gameplay feels smooth and well developed. The upgrades you can earn also make a real effect on the gameplay, it does not feel like you are just upgrading for the sake of it.   The reason I cannot give this game any higher than 7/ 10 is the story. I am a huge LOTR fan, so this was a very important aspect to me, and so was the way that the developers decided to do the combat. From the begining of the game the story builds and builds towards the final boss, that he is the most powerful besides Souron and must be defeated. What an anticlimax. When you finally get to this boss... it is a QTE... and not even a long one, about 5-6 commands. And that is it. All those upgrades you worked for were pointless in the end. No skill is involed in the fight at all. Exceedingly dissappointing.  Overall I have to say that I enjoyed this game right up until the final boss. I felt like collecting all the collectables and doing all the side quests would make me feel like the game was more complete when I killed the boss. Instead I felt as though I had just wasted my time. I would recommend this game if the story does not matter to you. If you are a LOTR fan then I would not recommened as the story just falls flat. The games combat is great and the skills you can earn are fun to use. There is a huge variety of enemies and animals that can be hunted and the nemisis system is wonderful.   Note to any developers: If you are making a game where it's whole story builds and builds toward the final boss, please please do not make that boss a QTE. Some elements are okay, for example, if you have to run up to them and press a command to hurt the enemy fine, but don't make the whole battle a QTE because it's not fun and requires no skill other than that you can read on screen commands.",1
-Can't save (u can now but this is the worst port EVER) -won't detect if I changed my controls so its still stuck on qwerty (I use azerty) -had compatibility issues (fixed that already) -runs like ♥♥♥♥ -looks like ♥♥♥♥  this game was way too overhyped,-1
  This Is One Of My First Games I Have Its A Stratagy Game Where The Main Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy Or By One Of The Many Other Ways Of Objectives!,1
"Extremely fiendishly clever. This one will have you scratching your head like Portal, but this one's FAR trickier. This game gives you god-like power, and then turns it against you and for you and against you again. The solution is never obvious, but re-visit it enough times and suddenly inspiration strikes. Very good game indeed",1
Best Comedy Game ? aahhh... You Win !!,1
"I originally bought this game because it invoked that feeling I got watching a heist movie.  Now it invokes that feeling I get when I watch the CS:GO community be incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing toxic, boring and repetitive.  This game used to be cool, now it's a meme with no more replay value.  I'm done.",-1
"This game is really cute and really fun. It has witty dialogue, an interesting plot, and a solid story line. As a fan of professor layton, I would have preferred more puzzles, but I absolutely loved this game. It actually requires thought and cleverness - two things that most 'detective' games now don't really need. 5/5 I've played it three times and I'm still not tired of it.",1
Its such a sweet story. Its so pretty and nostalgic. You will cry and you will love it.,1
It's a beautiful game. Can go single-player or 3 person co-op. Amazing platformer for an Indie game. You should really check this out.,1
"Terraria is a fun 2D game where you create your own character and explore your world. You can craft items to help you survive, battle, or build. The game is centered on defeating several tough bosses, ranging from somewhat spooky such as the giant mechanical skull, Skeletron Prime, or just silly, like the incredibly large shark/fish Duke Fishron. In order to prepare to fight these bosses, the player must find materials to craft their own gear. They'll go from makeshift wooden armor to the fabled Hallowed Armor, earning and finding weapons on the way. The game has violence in it which most of the time cannot be avoided. Finding some materials and sometimes just surviving means defending yourself against monsters small and large, ranging from floating eyeballs to surprisingly dangerous unicorns. When killed, enemies can splat pixelated blood that isn't very realistic. Most children and almost all teens can handle this. While not supposed to be a learning game, it does have some learning aspects, such as logical thinking. If I want to craft this sword, what items are most likely to make it? Besides that, it's not too inappropriate. The only other thing inappropriate in the game is that the player can craft a keg and brew their own ale and get an effect on their character called 'tipsy.' Besides this, I'd say it's good for anyone with a passion for adventure.  11/10",1
"This game is fun if you're the type of person who finds a hemorrhoid FUN. This makes getting a vasectomy look like a walk in the park. I honestly had to take a break and consider swallowing broken glass so I could physically experience the pain I was feeling emotionally in the hopes that it would help me get better at this damn game.  But seriously, as of this moment only 3 ♥♥♥♥ing people have the achievement, therefor I MUST have it.  (Srs tho; it's fun in an 'I wanna kill a whale' kind of way. You will get angry, but you won't walk away.)",1
bad game not alot of wifus to bang,-1
"This game offers alot action. Teamwork is always of value and when your defending petard bomb cart or buring down a settlement with a good team or friends its always fun.Seige battles not your fancy? Then thrers always areana combat the bloodiest of it all complete with a spike pit and razor sharp spike poles to kick people in and on always fun.With multiple weapons like my personal favorite the pole axe theres some thing for everyone pole arms,great swords,bow,throwing spears etc. this fine product is well worth the price.It will always offer gory fun for those medival fans. 10\10 and remeber my fellow knights FOR THE IRON GLOVE!",1
It's exactly as you'd expect; endlessly replayable and considerably better when played with mates as a team. But it's been out long enough that some people can do moves that you can only dream of.,1
Even if I completed the game time ago I still play it. This doesn't happen with the other single-player based games,1
"Awesome, gore and full of great references",1
"One of the greatest point and click aventure games of its' time. You know how you revist games and movies from your childhood and it's not as great as you remembered? I was afraid of this being the case with The Dig, but turns out that my fears were unfounded when I started playing this.  All my memories of playing this game as a kid came rushing back, and it was like I had everything memorized because I was able to solve everything in the game without even using a walkthough...which is kind of impressive for a person like me. I used to need walkthoughs badly when it came to games like Under A Steel Sky and Monkey Island. So I feel pretty good about that part.  Anyway, the characters and the story in the game is just as memorable as ever, and this is one aventure you won't forget easily. The graphics might be a little outdated to us now, but it's still beautiful as ever.",1
"At Last. A game that feels like Wipeout 2097. They have nailed the control scheme, the atmosphere, the tracks and even have done quite well with the soundtrack to. The speed is addictive. If you spent hours playing Wipeout 2097 back in the day, then this is what you have been waiting for.  In VR it works well but as always, start with the lowest graphical settings to go for that killer frame rate then up it slowly to what your system can handle without any jarring. Personally I tried it on the lowest settings on my 3 year old PC and only the Oculus DK2 but it ran really well with no issues (make sure to up the max frame rate option in game).   As a bonus i felt no sickness or nausea but so far VR has not added too much to the experience but it was nice to get some depth perception that may have helped at little in control. But of course you are not really looking around just facing forward to handle the speed. I found it better to play with the camera view showing just the nose of the craft to give you a point of reference in the VR space and look out for the loops though as I instinctively kept looking up so dont strain your neck with the adrenaline :) It also appears that your progress in VR mode will be separate from your progress in non-VR mode.",1
"This game...my god, this game. What a wonderful, beautiful and generally breathtaking experience! This game, although a fairly small RPG maker game, packs a lot of heart into its roughly 4 hour run time (it took me that long, anyway). 'To the moon' does what a lot of games struggle to do, it creates an emotional connection to its audience that gets stronger and stronger the more that you play, I actually had to stop playing about 2 hours in because I got so down that I needed to cheer myself up for a while. That sounds like a bad thing, believe me, it is not, the game got an emotional response out of me that no other game has even come close to (ok, maybe the Telltale Walking dead series) and I salute that. For what this is, this game is perfect and I congratulate the developer for creating such an amazing experience.  Ok, I guess I do have to come up with a downside, alright....this game does have one big, obvious down side and that is... Dr. Neil Watts; If you have played this game, you will know what I am talking about. Dr. Neil Watts tries to change to overall tone of this ENTIRE game and while, yes, his inclusion in the story does have some importance, I can't help but feel that his character, or at least his PERSONALITY, is not needed at all.  Thank you, Free bird games, for allowing me to experience this masterpiece of a game.",1
"enjoyed it from start, till the end.  in a few words, good story, funny moments, big world to explore, great puzzles, many items to collect, great gameplay, and some good old arcade play.  would buy again!",1
Beautiful visuals all the way through with fun puzzles and a nice story throughout.,1
Good simple game that can get extremely addictive.,1
"I love this game. i really liked the original and i played that one a lot, but i know almost everything about the original so it wasnt as much fun anymore so i picked up Dark Souls 2; scholar of the first sin. it looks good, steady framerate, challeging but not so much that it isnt fun anymore, cool new weapons and spells and much more. If your doubting whether you should buy it or not i recommend you buy it right now it is amazing. the only flaw is that in the beginning a certain area is really hard to do solo, so you can go immediatly to the hardest area and be displeased with the game because it is so hard.",1

"This is one of my most favorite games of all time. The only promblem is that it does work well on my laptop so I haven't played that much sadly (but I have played a crap ton on the xbox). If you play with mods then I suggest FWE (Fallout Wanderer's Edition), Brisa Almodavar, MMM (Mart's Mutant Mod), Fellout, along with a crap ton of others. I highly suggest you get this and love it, if not then well...don't play it...and die....no don't die...just don't breathe (I should mention it was midnight when I wrote this.)",1
Short but good. Quite a fun free-running games with a sprinkling of combat and a fair storyline. I always enjoy a distopian future setting for games so this was a good way to spend several of hours.,1
play the game for 2.5 hours and finished the story..... wow definitely worth the $15   fml,-1
Great game. I love how they removed food production and squalor. AI seems to be smarter from Attila and feels like the battles are more challenging.,1
"Combat is dissapointing after having just finished playing Witcher 2. Very slow camera movement, feels too much like a 'console-port'.",-1
"This version of the game does NOT have the standart campaign, but a risk-like map, where you can conquer different provinces. Despite it's age the game runs without problems on windows 7. The unique aspects of the game still impress today, and building your empire is way more fun than in any other RTS I've ever played.  Mutating your faction through different religion is also good fun. Of course the game has some minor problems, like unit-pathing when moving in formation, but it's not a gamebreaker. Have fun playing this absolute beast of a game :)",1
"Takes forever to beat the COM opponent in the combat training. Particularly hard to aim targets, also very inconvenience to control. It's not designed for most players. Only a few people could enjoy it. For them, the game is a five star game that contains such a explorable universe and the feeling of being the frontier. For the rest of players, this zero star game does not worth 40 bucks. So 1/5 for rating.",-1
"these guys understood what made Alien so terrifying and put all of that in a game, ♥♥♥♥ing hell",1
Pac-man with emojis? Not at all original but pretty neat none the less.,1
"Bought this game a couple of weeks ago when I heard about a UI update, and I've been having a blast. I've bounced off other sandboxy games like Wurm, but this one is holding my attention so far. Lots to do, and a lot of thought has been put into making even the basic activities like mining more fun than just holding down left-click and letting stuff float into your inventory.  The game is also pretty easy to get into and wrap your head around, despite having a ton of depth to it. Can't recommend it enough for space fans, unless you absolutely NEED PvP to have fun.",1
"I would recommend this game to anyone with a superior gaming system. I, personally, forgot to check the system requirements so when I tried playing the framerate was low.",1
This game is in my opinion one of the best games on Steam! Definitely recommend this game.  10/10.,1
made me kill my whole family  10/10,1
"Have never been so suprised by a game ever. Looks like your typical brainless action pumped shooter the first hour of the game. But ended up being one of the most well scripted campaigns with the greatest story of any action game i've played. It's so sad that it was marketed as another boring third person shooter as this game made you think and feel so much. Oh and those ♥♥♥♥ing loading screens. Going from first giving you some typical tips and backstory to some really good philosophical well thought out quotes. Then one that really hit me hardest the 'The US Military does not condone the killing of unarmed combatants, but none of this is real so why should you care?' one.   Any ho, get this game. Greatest campaign i've ever played through.",1
"Decently fun tower game, I haven't even beat it yet and its not really like 'that' great. Good for killing time if you're bored.",1
"Excellent game, excellent arcade. You have nothinng to lose trying this game, it's 100% free!",1
Microtransactions welp I knew this day would come. Welp everyone back on the bus next stop will be Payday 1 if they leave that alone we can go there. Or just keeping riding into the sunset and never looking back. Becuase I'm sure someone will make a game like Payday and when that time comes we can stop the bus and get out and see what it has to offer.,-1
this game is amazing i recommend you buy the dont starve alone pack because it is definetly worth the extra bucks. dlc adds so much more new content so you'll have hours of fun. even if you may die a couple thousand times its fun starting over and getting used to the game and how you play it. 10/10,1
One way to make this game great again = SEA SERVER,1
A game released in 2013 that DOES NOT HAVE 1080P IN THE SETTINGS. I HAD TO EDIT A CONFIG FILE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE.,-1
Damn this game is freaking terrifying! it scared the crap out of me! i diffenelty recommend it.,1
"Being a childhood fan of the game as my older sibling owned the 3rd edition board game, I had high hopes for this. Instead I recieved an unstable and uninventive innacurate rendition seemingly built for barely anything and with little passion",-1
"1$ at humblebundle, worth it!",1
"This game Is literally one of my childhood games My brother got me into it when i was like 6 or 7 I'm 16 now. And honestly This game is a must have but it requires C&amp;C3 to play It has an intense storyline and I recommend it to anybody willing to play! It has bonus New Units and superweapons! It is an awesome game Franchise. Sadly Command and conquer 4 is nothing like it From what i've heard, I prefer This over any other command and conquer in general. If this game had Naval units it probably would have been the best command and conquer ever made compared to Red alert 3. I suggest you try it sometime. Also if you can't play online the old servers shut down But! there is still hope! Go to C&amp;C online and they have servers to where you can PvP against others. Help them by donating to keep the servers up and running!!! KANE LIVES!",1
"  Despite a few bugs and gameplay changes I still highly recommend this game; I mean its still BioShock. The most annoying change that I've found so far is the Vit-Chambers don't autosave anymore, nor does the game when you enter another area. Most frustrating regarding saves is there's no longer a prompt to save when you exit the game. I lost a few hours of gameplay after exiting to windows, which was exacerbated by the before mentioned save change changes. I don't know if these are unique to my game vs others. I've noticed some inconsistancy between players and the bugs/changes they're experiencing.  Another thing, that maybe I just didn't notice before, is self injury via Plasmids. Granted this is something I could have overlooked from the original, but I want to say that, for example, if you electrocuted splicers in water you could immediately go in to loot where as now you electrocute yourself. This doesn't take away from the gameplay though, instead just makes you play smarter - or rather more realistically.   Still a great game 5/7 rating overall.",1
"Okay, the first thing you need to know about FTL is that it is hard. Don't be fooled by the ability to pause the action and the 'Easy' game mode - it isn't. Easy for FTL = Hard for most other games, and Normal? = Nighmare mode; and when you die, guess what? It's game over. No save points, no second chances when you screw up badly - you're finished. ... Okay, granted, I'm no strategy guru, but I'm no slouch either. Simply put, FTL is hard.  Which leads me to the second thing you need to know: FTL is awesome. Ask yourself, how would someone have attempted EVE or Star Trek Online in the early 90s? FTL is the answer. You get to command a starship with all the intricacies that entails in a bonafide arcade sim. Just because it is hard doesn't make it less enjoyable or addictive; it just means when you get that achievement or unlock a ship, it really means something.  Bottom line: FTL is hard, but I think that makes it more enjoyable, not less.  [EDIT]  It's been almost three years now since I wrote this review. At some point during that time, the AE version was released.   Just last week, I decided to pick it up again, since there are still several achievements I haven't completed and ships that I haven't unlocked. I usually played in bursts of an hour or two, once or twice a day.  Just a few minutes ago, I had gotten my stealth cruiser to the flagship, and was, after an extended fight, eventually destroyed (and yes, it was probably due to a strategic error on my part, but not a big one). That was the furthest I had gotten after about 12 hours of play over this past week.  I am writing this addendum to my review simply to explain why I'm not feeling as enthusiastic about this game as I was three years ago. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great game and I stand by most of what I said in my review. It's just that, to get enjoyment from FTL, you have to approach it with the right expectations before you play. Just because it's a 2D indie game doesn't mean it's casual (at least what I would classify as casual). Play it without an expectation of winning in the first five, or even fifteen, runs you start. You just have to work through it, and eventually you will win a run.  I want to say that the game has gotten even more difficult with the AE content, but I haven't verified that difference myself.  Bottom line: FTL is a great game, but hard. I almost can't stress that enough. Adjust your expectations with that in mind.  [EDIT 2]  It's been a couple months, I think, since the previous edit. I, just an hour ago, made my first victory over the flagship in quite some time, probably a year or so since the last time I played prior to the first edit. I wanted to quickly revisit what I said above:   I want to say that the game has gotten even more difficult with the AE content, but I haven't verified that difference myself.  While I still don't have a definite proof of this, I just looked at my game stats, and have at least some evidence of confirmation.  Total games: 102 Total victories: 8 Total victories with AE enabled: 2  Keep in mind that, first, 'total games' includes every game I've started - even ones I just restarted in sector one because I felt like playing as a different ship or whatever. Second, every victory was with a different ship/layout and was usually made atfer three or more failed attempts. Third, the last number isn't shown as part of the stats. I had to look through my top ship scores for that. Fourth, obviously several of these victories were made prior to the release of the AE (though I'm pretty certain at least four of them were not).  This leads me to believe that I'm not just imagining the difference in difficulty with the addition of the AE content. My advice then, for what it's worth, is to only play with AE enabled for unlocking AE-specific ships/achievements. For all the original stuff, leave it off. I think that will make progress towards unlocks a little easier.",1
This game makes me want to kill myself FOR ANY MAGIC FAN DO NOT PURCHASE THE GAME. Thumbs down,-1
"Decent.  Pros: +Good production values. The music and graphics are both competently produced. +Some nice extras (a prequel is unlocked as a bonus upon the game's completion, for example).  Cons: -A few of the hidden objects don't feel fair because of being poorly drawn or inaccurately named, and a few hitboxes for them are problematic, though both problems are rare enough and ameliorated somewhat by the hint system. Still, it's too bad the otherwise well-done QA didn't pick up on these problems. -The voice acting isn't great. It's not terrible, but it's obvious enough that they didn't hire professional actors. (It gets worse toward the end of the adventure.)  Artistic Value: 4 Fun Factor: 7.5 My Score: 7",1
At least they tried.....,-1
my crash mostly about 4 min. in the game in coop.,1
"It advertises being a RPG game but its actually not, there is only a little bit of character (skill) development and not much dialog. The story isn’t that bad actually but nothing memorable, its the usual ”scientific research went work and some special forces have been sent to investigate it”.  Some of the advertised features are little strange, like the ”multiple-choice dialog”, there was not a single dialog where you could choose anything, I think there was totally only about 30 lines of dialog in the whole game, so that about the ”enthralling dialog”.  The skills you can train are mostly useless, I think that only luck and HP were useful enough to put points in.  But otherwise this is still some decent old school turn-based action game, just don’t except any RPG elements in it. Its moderately challenging, the beginning can be frustratingly hard as you don’t get too many ammo and medpaks, so you always need to think every step thoroughly, every turn counts and you can not make any mistakes.  Be warned, it might not work on newer machines. I got it running on my old laptop (WIN7) but it didn’t even start on my new desktop setup (with Win7 also), always crashed on the start. Even on my laptop it still crashed sometimes in battles, it has really bad bug in the second last fight, where it would crash every time I killed the last monster in the battle, and the only way around it was skipping that battle with cheat-code.  6/10",1
"Before I downloaded this app, I was pretty skeptical due to the large amount of false 'dummy' applications that will just let you view certain GPU characteristics without modifying them. However, after I downloaded it and messed around with it and of course reverting to defaults a few times because I didn't want to mess up my graphics card (lol), I found this to be a VERY handy tool. It helps me when I record for YouTube because I can set a goal frame rate and it will help my gpu do everything that it can to reach that goal, and it brings out the best videos! Thank you for making such a great software available to the public!",1

Its awsome i would name it Robber simulation 2 infinty,1
"The story arcs are fairly weak compared to other Elder Scrolls games I've played, and I also feel that this isn't what the online experience is supposed to be. Still pretty fun though.",1
"Simply amazing, A full on 24/7 cops and robbers: Plenty of interesting missions, Ramming into storefront windows and stealing their stuff, mugging people and stealing their stuff, Even going around tagging places with your own symbols! I give it a 9.5/10 only because the community has a lot of modders, hackers, and lag switches.",1
awesome sandbox action !,1
Just finished it! Totally amazing. Still one of the greatest games ever made.,1
does not work stay away waste of money,-1
it is very fun to play with freinds,1
the open world and degrading weapons makesthis game so much fun. i wish i had more time to play every day,1
"My favorite game in recent memory. Seamlessly blends the beautifully-nostalgic properties of Maniac Mansion with the old NES Friday the 13th game, in a sandbox-style engine.  There's *much* more to it than that, of course; I'm merely paraphrasing. The music is absolutely fantastic (as are the sound effects), and even the hub world has an interesting mystery to discover. But seriously, I cannot stress enough just how amazing the atmosphere is in this game.  Needless to say, as a huge fan of old NES horror games, and old newgrounds-esque flash games alike, this game is right up my alley. I cannot wait for the new episodes! 10/10",1
"A very simple cute little game. Everything else is self-explanatory. The demo should take you 10-20 minutes to complete, so check it out!",1
"This game is amazing. Need I say more? It has good enough graphics, hilarious moments, a memorable title screen theme, and more physics than Einstein could figure out on LDS. 10/10. Would play 24 hours again. ",1
Awesome concept and fun gameplay you can also play it really good with a conrtoller and i just love the voice jobs!,1
"Game is not ready yet, I think. That's why no.  I found several UI and gameplay bugs (blinking of UI, declaration of war from unknown player is shown as I declare war from me to me and etc.). AI is primitive, or I didn't understand new AI )) They always declare war to me, every nation. I can be aggresive or peaceful, it's no metter. Can be big or small. Sometimes somenations is more smart, but I played twice and I met two or three or them. Maybe theirs hidden goals are balanced bad from game to game, but it's bad too. And when I kill one or two its warriors (but still have more powerful army, then mine), they ask me to end the war and give me money. And it happens always with all nations.  If telling something good. I like graphics, like districts, like culture, like new moving mechanics (saw someone dislikes it, but it's more logics to move like this). I think, I like most of new features in game mechanics, but the game is still raw.  It will be good, if we will see new update soon, which will make this game better.",-1

"What I can say about Outlast, is that it's an incredibly fun and terrifying experience of the likes I have never seen. With stunning visuals and excellent gameplay, Outlast is a horror game that is welcome to all horror fans. Dashing through a bloody hallway with a deformed patient at your heels is always exciting, oh, and did I mention it has Parkour? A little repetative at times, but still an engrossing and epic experience. Outlast is the most fun horror game I have played, and will continue to play for a long time, horror fans, thank Red Barrels for this masterpiece.",1
This game is ok.,1
"If you enjoy really simple turn-based games, this game is a pretty good place to start. Really old graphics, but I myself have found them very suitable for the game. It's definitely pretty different compared to Disciples III. It brings back a lot of memories for me, from an era of endless PC games. Worth a try if any of the screenshots or the writeup appeals to you. :D",1
"FINALLY I CAN PLAY THE FIRST NEP NEP WITHOUT HAVING TO PLAY THE FIRST NEP NEP AND WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HANDHELD  11/10 WAS WAITING FOR A PORT TO PS3 AND IDEA FACTORY UPPED THE GAME AND PORTED TO PC  on a somewhat serious note though, i was spooked about how the port was gonna be and, for the most part, it seems to be one of the better ports ive seen. whether it be a japanese or western game.  -gwafix options are almost non-existant sadly, but since half the game is VN-style i guess we can let that pass.  -rebindable keys was something i was surprised to see, but sadly it doesnt show keyboard keys onscreen. Like if you bind E to be the X button it will still show the X button instead of the E key.  -its got the english and japanese voices like in all the other games along with several different audio sliders  -judging off the video of the CPUs fighting at the start, i assume the videos are not 1080p and are just upscaled, but the opening video seemed to be 1080p along with everything else.  -the resolution option was weird, it says it caps at 1600x900, but that option is only for windowed mode. fullscreen goes to whatever your desktop resolution is.  -despite being able to rebind all the keys, it might still feel kind of strange. certainly not game-breaking, its just my index finger is starting to think im playing Diablo III and not a JRPG  as for the game itself, well its nep nep. its really the only JRPG series aside from Pokemon where id play through the games more than once. its full of video game and anime humor and frequently breaks the fourth wall. hell, the premise of the game is a parody of the feud between sony, nintendo, and microsoft.  so yeah  i hope idea factory brings more nep nep to Steam i also hope this makes other JP devs realize there's a market for their games on PC",1
"Why is Steam allowed to sell GFWL garbage? ♥♥♥♥ you Valve for not granting my refund, ♥♥♥♥ GFWL and ♥♥♥♥ this game.",-1
"I like this game, I got it free on an Indiegala giveaway, but if I knew about t before I would buy it. 8/10",1
"Simple concept, perfectly executed. Even better, it contains no pay-to-win or microtransaction models. All cars are identical, so how you do is purely based on how good you, your team and your opponents are. Play this game. Play it now.",1
I love this game! It has many controls but you get used to them pretty quick! The only thing wrong with this game is that you can't play in first person! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!,1
"Not your typical MMO this one. It has a lot of the staple MMO tropes with quest based progression and the 'Holy Trinity' of Tanks, DPS, and Healers...it does hold a special place in my heart. The investigation aspects of this game are amazing and it's quite clear the writers took a lot of time to make sure that you would get involved in the lore of the store they're trying to tell. Even in the first zone there are missions that require you to understand latin, know 16th Century composers, and be able to determine where to look off of very little info given.   While the combat system is rather bland, and it once again follows the typical MMO tropes of follow a quest line through a zone...I can say it held my attention for the many hours I played (Even though it says I've played 14 I have much more then that due to their launcher being derpy.) I would suggest picking this up full price if you're intrigued about the storyline and are looking for an MMO to try out...or wait till it goes on sale and pick it up for you and a couple of friends. I do however warn you, if you're looking for the typical WoW style gameplay, it's not here. If you don't like reading, or using your head then the investigation missions might not be for you. (And yes you can look up the answers online...but whats the fun in that?)   ",1

After you spend half an hour ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about to register your account, resetting passwords and all the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t associated eventually be able to login, the game hangs and states it is not responding whilst trying to load the list of servers.  Smashing Job on that front",-1
"Well I decided to re write this review since much has changed with this game over the period of time it has been out so here we go. Street Fighter V is a fighting game with brilliant and deep mechanics that feels great and responsive even with the 8 frames of input lag that seems to have been built into the game. The graphics style is a really nice mesh of some more realistic textures but with a unique style that has colors popping vibrantly and keeps a consistant framerate of 60fps.  As for the actual game, mechanically its really solid with great feeling hits and a really great grasp of control over your chosen character be it a heavy hittler like Zangief or a quicker nippy character Rashid its a great level of control regardless if your on an arcade stick or a gamepad. Execution with characters like Ryu are fairly easy as his target combo is a great and powerful option but very punishable and his special moves are easy to throw out and use strategically. Charge characters like Guile and Bison are easier than ever but still will remain a hurdle for newcomers to climb over and master but the game does now provide a fairly decent number of lessons to teach you its mechanics and what you should be doing and when to do it. In terms of content the game is still not the best not even having a proper arcade mode its hard to recommend this game on singleplayer content, but with the story mode coming at the end of the month that could potentially change. The roster is greatly diverse with pretty much a character for every playstyle imaginable and whilst it is a smaller roster it isnn't an oversaturated roster of shoto characters. Overall the game was realeased barely half finished and with almost non functional online support it was a mess. However the game is now shaping up to be a really well done and exciting fighting game that is almost worth recommending but not at full price due to the lack of a proper CPU VS mode that isnt that survival mode crap. I'd say buy this one at the end of June from Instant Gaming for about £21 and save yourself some time and buy the season pass from the same place and it'll be worth it if you want a game that works just fine online but if your not interested in online then give this one a pass for now.   Pros  -Great Graphics -Epic Soundtrack -Easy to pick up for beginners -Deep layers for competitve players -Works great online -Laura..... Just..... Laura -Female alternates ;) -Hot Ryu ;)   Cons  -No good singleplayer content -Barely half a game at launch -Missing features -Painfully slow content releases -Kens Mug -Kens Dumpling Shop Alt -No Direct Input -Netcode issues -8 Frames of input lag for no reason!?  EDIT - Story mode is fantastic and has great fanservice but not what your looking for if you want an arcade mode type deal!",-1
As good as expected. Great time playing.,1
"Wonderful! It is a loss that games like this go under the radar, it is fun to play and I had a very enjoyable experience. Though it isn't long (I finished it in about 12 hours), it is rewarding to acomplish the goal of the story. It felt like a movie, a sci-fi/fantasy one, the main character didn't feel shallow, he is a barbarian but not a savage. It is a good adventure/action game, and the end of the story was a real surprise to me. You can play with keyboard and mouse, but it is easier to do with a controller. Graphics are not the best (and shadows look bad on cinematics), but that doesn't carry you away from the action nor from enjoying the game. Not all the people like hack &amp; slash games, or console ports, I usually play other type of games, but I'm happy I bought this one, I bought Enslaved on discount, but now that I finished it I would have paid more for it. Added bonus, the female character is very pretty :P",1
Best multiplayer thriller game out right now imo. Better than Damned and Dead Realm.,1
This Alien game is the one everyone wanted not the past ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones this games feels amzaing It feels like a real Alien experience and it goes back to the first alien film in 1986 i think the 80's technolgy in the game completes the atmosphere of the game it feels scrary the sounds/audio in the game is amazing now I just enough into the game to see the alien and he is a real boss he is a badass and really smart so watch out trust Get This Game! :D,1
been playing since NSS3 and I love it,1
"Perfect game, just 1 Neg.Thing: Barely has any servers",1
"Best Close Combat game i have played to date and i have played all of them apart from panthers in the fog sounds better, looks better, tanks Ai is still clunky but this takes nothing away from the game. the multiplayer is even better than single and if you can find a friend to do a campaign with its truly EPIC! a must for any WW2 strat fan",1
Perfect! This game Is a revolution to the GTA series out of every GTA game this is my favorite and always will be! I recommend this game 10/10!,1
I only bought it so I could play TTT,1
"WOW. This game has had me sucked in for hours on end already. I've been waiting for this game for ages and it did not disappoint to say the least. I started my first game and got obliterated. Second game, I over reached and was taken with ease. Third game, I lowered difficutly and started to get the feel of the game. All in all, I have a lot to learn but im catching on.   PROS: -Good cartoony style graphics, looks great. -Smart AI who WILL take advantage of your weaknesses and mistakes. -Diverse leaders and bonuses for each. -Revamped religion with an interesting twist to stradegy. -Fresh concepts with the districts and wonders. -Great people earned in different ways offering a challenge/race to aquire them.  -Movement overhaul enhancing combat and the way you get around the map.  CONS: -Districts take a lot of space and leave less hammers, food, science, etc. to be had on tiles. -Building wonders is a secondary goal with steep requirements and space they take on tiles.  -Cities are constantly unhappy because of lack of entertainment districts, entertainment district almost required in every city.  To sum it all up, there are a lot of new concepts to the game, like, amenitites, religious combat, and districts. All of these things can be a bit confusing at first and frustrate you. Also, CIV V strategies will almost always NOT work in this CIV. The AI are smarter and the gameplay is way different.   Once patches and more DLC come out, this game will rival all previous CIV games, and definitely surpass the likes of CIV V. Final Rate: 9/10 ",1
THIS GAME SO COOL ,1
nice game overall. just count your per hour pay vs per hour farming  i would go per hour pay from my actual work. than farming lol,1
"I don't play RTS games, but this is actually pretty awesome. There's so much variety with the units you control and I even like the campaign mode with scenarios taking place during, before, or after the movies. This is a game I can't get enough of. Definitely worth $10 if you're interested as it really doesn't get old.",1
"It's a simple and a fun game to play,it has great soundtrack and it can be quite challenging,it's really cheap when on sale,i definetly recommend it.",1
It's a great game! :D,1
"I'm rate this half 4 star, Becuase this software is Better",1
"Quake live is just silly now. I was hesitant to uninstall it because I use to love this game and sunk hundreds of hours into it, but meh. Unfortunatly competitive arena shooters are on the decline, and this was my favorite.  UPDATE: I keep trying it to see if I could get back into it, but it just feels like a waste of my time.",-1
"  wh... what was this game?  I honestly don't know.  The game has good graphics and atmosphere, with the art style reminding me of Limbo, but... WHAT?!  The game is an atmospheric, go-right-to-win walking simulator that is occasionally broken up by a simple sound puzzle or a QTE. The game takes about a half an hour to beat, and since it's free, I can't really be angry at this game. However, the story on the store page is very misleading and there is never any kind of story or explanation for the game. If this was more fleshed out and given more context, then I would whole-heartedly reccomend a playthrough. However, since it's not and there isn't, I would tell you to skip over this one. You won't be missing much.   Actually, the entire time, what actually interested me was the thought of who built all the machinery you see throughout the game, and why no one's around.",-1
"Look really good at the vidoe and at the screenshots. You only get sound effects and stuff and items. Not really something special. Fun if your bored, otherwise not worth it.",-1
Petty cool,1
Just generally really glitchy and awful.,-1
"Not as awesome as it sounds. Turning is a ♥♥♥♥♥. In general it's very clunky, but kinda a demo of Warhammer 40k mechanics.",-1
"i wish this game was good. i really do. i played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it back in alpha and it was so fun. i love a survival game where i cant die to a random headshot and lose all my gear. all the fights i had with KoS people i usually won because the combat required a marginal amount of skill and wasn't as gear dependent as other survival genres  the crest system is by far my favorite system of build protection in any game. people can still raid your base by breaking through the walls but if they want to remove your base completely they have to siege destroy it brick by brick. the crest invulnerability means that when you log back on from offline raiding your ♥♥♥♥ might be gone but at least your base's shell remains.   anyway just do what the positive reviews say, buy it if you know a good roleplay community with active admins. if you dont, dont touch this.",1
"Much better than COD and games like that, in my opinion. Its also much harder tho.  8.5/10",1

"A step backwards in the series.  Effort has been put in to visuals but the game is a let down in AI, sound and fun. There's no challenge to the game and little replay value.  I paid $40 and I should have waited for it to be $10 with all DLC.",-1
"Fun, especially playing with people you know. Repetitive, but still good to play every once in a while  8/10",1
"This game may seem like a RTS game, but it's more of an RPG. You play as a dynasty, all characters in your bloodline. The game can get really tense, or actually quite funny. There's a learning curve, but other than that, it's easy to get into once you know how to play. It's only just about a gigabyte, and I couldn't recommend a Paradox game more. Seriously, you can SEX someone to death. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT.",1
"A little difficult to get into, but once you know what you're doing it becomes highly addictive. And do to the fact that its in alpha it can only get better",1
"Sorry but it's just really poor. The graphics, weapons, gameplay, everything. It's a bit silly, and maybe fun for 30 minutes if you're into that.",-1
hey this is good game,1
"After completing this game, I was VERY surprised at how deep the story was and how you cannot even fathom the point of the game until the end. An excellent value, both as story/entertainment and replayable via speedrun. Excellent.",1
"I barely write reviews but now i just have to, and I will tell you what made me do this.  First of all I wanna go over a few Pros and Cons, I think it is just the easiest way of showing what is good and what not.  Starting with the PROs:  -NOT DOWNGRADED (Even I was surprised and i had to think a long time if I want to buy another Ubisoft Game, now i don't regret nothing) -Beautiful Animations -Scenery -Very exciting Lighting -Cool Phone Concept -Better Story than in the first game (i can tell already, I just played a few hours tho and thats a good thing to be able to tell after such a short time) -More Interesting Characters overall -Vehicle Damages look so much more statisfying -Quadrocopter/Drone -Good Stealth - especially hard at 'Realistic' difficulty -Sudden Coop Missions  CONs:  -Standard Key Bindings are a bit complicated and hard for realtime events like a police chase f.e., although you get used to it, or simply change like I did -Map seems a bit empty and small (It's actually pretty big, it just appears small on your phone) -Sudden Coop Missions ( Yes, it is positive and negative as well, because some people just want to play the game by themselves, at least the main story, so this could maybe disturb)   Now for the reason I am writing this Review:  Eversince, I have been a big Fan of the first Knight Rider TV-Show (80s, The newer one, i think 2008, was a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster). If you know and maybe even love the series as much as I do you will be positively surprised by a certain reference to it. Maybe it is almost a copy.  I enjoyed this game to this point and i believe strongly, that this is also the case when i am done playing this game. NO REGRATS",1
"Very good overall gameplay. Good mechanics, good weapon selection, very good replay value, much to work for in the game, with long storyline and extra in-game content. DLC is good as well. Highly recommend. Only dislike is due to the somewhat initial difficulty in the beginning.",1
  Just a plain good game,1
-Good Story -Exelent Graphics -Great Soundtrack -Exelent Gameplay -Responsive Controls  Best 2D platformer I ever played. 10/10,1
"Veteran here. I have played about 14000 matches since the Open Beta began. If you grew up a Battletech fan or are new to the title/lore, this game is a lot of fun. It does not currently have any PvE, or compelling storyline, just mechwarrior death matches through different battlefields.  Reasons this game is great: -Multiplayer PvP in 12 man teams. -Hundreds of 'mechs with tons of options for customization. -Decent graphics -Good controls and weaponry options -Community Warfare, where you can join a larger faction and vie for control of the Inner Sphere. -Good changes recently, with no indication of them stopping. It is my opinion that the devs really do like their game and want to make it better.  Reasons it is not so great: -Steep learning curve. Expect to get demolished alot at the begining. -Some of the details about what things do in-game are not always clearly defined. -Not enough maps. -Community Warfare could use some fleshing out.  This game is all about teamwork, understanding your battlefield role, and general knowledge of the strengths and weaknessess of each mech. Emphasis on teamwork, poor teamwork can make any match into a roflstomp (Rambos usually die in shame). Check out the forums and find some help and advice. There are tons of great people who are willing to help, and like every MMO there are also trolls. Finding a unit to join and playing with friends is what really makes this game the most fun. ",1

"This is the first time I have written a review for any game, I own hundreds (literally), so you as the reader should absolutely read into the fact that I have decided to bother. I can't speak to everyone's tastes of course, but I can say that I was reluctant to buy this originally because the genre has been growing stale to me, but I took a chance on it when it was on sale.  Having played it for a couple of weeks, I can say that without a doubt, knowing what I know now about it, I would very happily have bought this at full price (and even more, frankly). Many, many reasons, here's a very short list:  The 'just one more turn' games are generally irresistible to me, obviously the civ franchise being the prime examples. EL has honestly replaced CIV 2 (I know I'm old) as my favorite. The 4X game concept is an old formula; EL just does it better than any I've ever played, from the basic expectations for civ building and strategy to the character and ambiance and flavor of the art/experience. Every faction feels distinct and interesting with very unique traits and abilities/disabilities and backstory and quests. Every build mechanic/game concept feels both contextually proper and visceral, even down the city building portion of the game - using districts to actually physically expand and fill the regions with 'city', gives an immersive sense of development.  I could truly go on, but I bet most have stopped reading at this point and seen this post for the gushing that it is. Because everyone's tastes are so different I'll just leave it at this... If you are a 4X fan and you like the old civ games for their uniqueness and flavor but the new civs for their depth of concept, DO NOT WAIT, BUY THIS GAME.",1
boring,1
"A solid spin-off of the traditinal RTS, DoW II takes the premise of a stong first showing with DoW and Winter Assault and takes the game to a whole new level. The single player campaign allows for some solid action and adventuring against a new host of enemies while the new levelling and item equip system establishes some continuity and a more goal-oriented approach than the traditional 'Build up and tear down' RTS campaign can offer.  Rich voice acting and solid graphics couple with the telltale chaotic pumping of bolters, plasma guns and chain swords to provide a great visceral experience with great ambiance and enough versatility to allow you to customize your style of play / strategize from mission to mission using different units to suit different approaches.   Best of all, a 'Drop in, Drop out' mission by mission co-op feature to the campaign makes gaming with friends easy and effective. A great buy if you can get Chaos Rising and Retribution in an package for $10 - $20.",1

Great game.,1
"Great Game, when it came out mostly as this kind of runs bad on most modern PC's",1
"Awesome game. Great multiplayer fun. Fills the fantasy in one's life of robbing the dingleberries out of banks and armored vehicles on a massive wave of a scale.  There's a decent level of replayability to the levels that make it interesting to keep digging through. However, it feels a bit grindish trying to unlock certain things. Other than that, it's a splendid game that is generous with the amount of bullets, bodies, and blood thrown about the map.  The option of stealthing a mission, tactical assault for speed, or just going straight into it are what add to the games replayability.   78 gold bars out of 100. Not bad.",1
"The Pros: The game is pretty. The art is pretty much as I remember the board game. The UI while unintuitive does cover most things. Winning can be fun.  The Cons: Losing can be really boring. Being stuck on the command crown for endless turns whilst your one remaining opponent wanders the outer regions merely healing when you get the command spell to hit (every 1 in 5 times, and I started that end game approach with 8 fate) is not my idea of going out in a blaze of glory. The AI makes no attempt to get near you once you are down to two players.   There are many moments of frustration in the game. Many of them aren't particularly meaningful except as an 'I gotchya' tweak that the game pulls on you. (Being unable to control when some spells go off, having situations where you are forced to target yourself with abilities or spells because the UI doesn't allow you to back up, losing all your items/gold/followers to bad encounters, rarely ever burning a fate point that actually helps, the list is probably endless.) That said if you are a fan of random, I think this game really hits that spot.   Whilst Catan (the online version) is kind of sad for not having multi player options, Talisman does have this.  I can't say I think much of the pay to play nickle &amp; dime approach (and what big dimes they are!) but it is nice that you can customize what you get in terms of characters/boards. I haven't done that but I expect those who want to enjoy multi player will eventually get the relevent characters.   One thing seems a bit inobvious but is probably true anyway: You are able to win with any of the characters. The key being that you spend the time to learn how that character survives and adapts appropriately. Some might have a steep curve.  I am recommending this game with a 6/10. Meaning: 'caveat emptor' if you have problems with random games. It is fun once you set aside the disappointments and frustrations.",1
After an hours play I have no idea what I am doing. Just get civ V instead and save yourself some frustration.,-1
I wasn't racist before I played this game.,1
"Here's what you want in a shooter: toggle crouch, toggle run, hold ADS.   Here's what you get in Crysis Warhead: hold crouch, hold run, toggle ADS.  It feels awful. Way worse than Crysis somehow. ADS feels like it's autoaiming even though it's not because it snaps into place. There's no plot. It runs poorly, even on modern cards. I would avoid this garbage. Stick to Crysis 1 and mod it and enjoy.",-1

"Don't let the 'Loli' Steam banner fool you.   This isn't a JRPG that panders to the Loli-crowd. Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all. Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story. The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act. However, what really kept it interesting were the characters. The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny.  The game includes 3 Chapters. Each has multiple endings. The first two chapters each took me about 1.5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending.  The BGM are great and sets the mood as well.   I highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters. Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops.  EDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~!",1
"Could have been MUCH longer, especially for 60 bucks. The graphics were excellent but the conversations, at least for me, were out of sync with the actual dialogue. The ending is a considerably let down and let me say ♥♥♥♥ QUICK TIME EVENTS. This also messes with the canon a bit. Overall it is fun but wait till it goes on sale because it is not worth its current price. Combat mehcanics are on the whole good and the nemesis system is fun. They have treaded some new ground here and there but on the whole it is the same stuff rehashed.",1
"Warning: Not a full F2P-game!  You will have to buy new mission packs to proceed to the higher ranks. You can farm the ingame-currency, but this might take you months, to get some of the most needed updates. So if you are looking for a F2P go look elsweyr ;-)  But if you are willing to invest the average price of a new pc-game then you are golden. Game offers a nice community, tons of missions, which can be run solo and many raids, which require a good team.   It does not have epic graphix, but epic fights, loot and tales, enough epicness imho.   So go RTD.",1
This is a great game! Great Music! Great Gameplay! Great looks! BUY IT!,1
things taste pretty much how i thought they would....as a electronic goat....,1

It's a good free to play game where you can be a space ninja doing parkours and kill hundreds of enemies while looking awesome.,1
Love Trains then this is the game for you.  Its got loads of content and loads of DLCs you can buy for it.  Game Play is great and graphics are great.,1
"Terraria is exactly what it looks like. 2d Minecraft. Yes, I know what you're thinking, another Minecraft ripoff. BUT YOU'RE WRONG. True it's very similar, but it's very different simultaneously. It has much more content and many more bosses and more adventure and- I could go on all day. Buy it, it's decades of fun.",1
"Very differint from what i expected, But very enjoyable. Has a smooth RTS feel with a Fallout Shelter base bulder. 9/11 #BUSHDIDIT",1

Civ V consumed many hours of my life. This one after 50 hrs is poised to consume even more so.,1
"It is short, but it has replay value. Thanks to all the sound it feels as if you're typing everything yourself (which you do, sort of). Because of the look and feel I wouldn't have been suprised if it would've cost some euros. but hey, it doesn't. so go download this f2p game. this should be a standard for f2p games on steam. I wish there was some place to donate the designer so he could make more games like this one.",1
The dialogue will trap you within it's iron grip until you reach the end.,1
"This game is great. Put off playing for a long time because of the Minecraft like graphics, and people putting it down for being a 'kid game'.   It's fast paced and easy to pick up. You do get tons of loot easily, but there is also tons of rare loot that almost no one has.   There are boxes that drop after level 10(Chaos Box) that have a rare chance to give you cash shop items. So it's possible to get pretty much any cash shop item just by playing the game.  I've seen no Pay to Win features all, this game probably has one of the best microtransaction systems I've seen, also many of the cash shop items are purchasable using a currency earned in game(Cubits).  Once you get around lvl 15+(Uber 3 and up) the game starts to get pretty difficult. I didn't expect this with how easy the earlier worlds are, but it actually has some decent challenge. It has some good 8 man group content in Shadow Arenas, and soon they are adding Shadow Towers which I don't know the details of but I'm guessing its similar on a larger scale.  I could go on but the game is Free to Play. It took me about 5 minutes to download, try it out and give it a fair shot you won't be disappointed.",1
"I can't wait for the the next patch, hopping that I may actually play the game.  Stuck on the loading screen, and the I have to force quit it with task manager, but not only that.  After opening the game, my Laptop pretty much needs a restart, not sure why, but everytime I open the game, it just destroyrs my laptop.   If someone has any suggestion please leave me one, cause I did not spend money on this game for nothing.  P.S I know I need a new Laptop or PC so leave your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ suggestion about that.",-1
"I went into this game blind not knowing what to expect and I was pleasntly surprised.  This game is immersive, fun, and addictive. The three best words to describe a game. It was totally worth every penny I spent. If you enjoy randomized maps, strategy, and management, this game is for you.",1
A surprising success after Cities in Motion wasn't that great. This is probably one of the best buys in recent years. Prepare for a game that is easy to play but difficult to master. Once your cities get beyond a certain size you'll need to start employing some strategies around policies and transport to stop your city from grinding to a halt and crumbling.   Mod support too!,1
"10/10 First of all I would like to say that I loved this game. The gameplay, the story, and the great characters brought back amazing memories of my past. I used to have a brain dead brother who loved playing games with great characters. This game brought back those memories.  Now back to the review. This game had an amazing opening cut scene. Immediately you are brought into a world of mystical planets and asteroids that look like baked potatoes. And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. It was majestic and brought tears into my eyes. SPOILERS!!!! The moment Officer Uncle Frank died by my hands, I was so happy and I cried. So stop reading this review and play this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"For the Days when I didn't have cod or any other good shooter, this game filled the void very nicely. Actually an extremely fun game, especially at the start when you keep leveling up and getting bonus packs. I myself have never spent real money and still found it enjoyable. Yeah the guns would be nice if they didnt cost so much but you dont need to play this game every day. So worth it for a free game. Fun too will keep playing it sometimes. 7.5/10",1
"Great game, loved the story and the zombies mode was amazing, definetly a good buy if it's on sale.",1
"This lego game is extremely fun and you sould definitely try it but, there is some things that could have been better. First thing wrong is that Superman cant go fast like the Flash it was ok in lego batman 2 but, in this one I was expecting it mabye it could be with holding down a button to go into fast mode but only punching when its enabled mabye put that in lego batman 4?  Next thing wrong is Bruce Wayne cant turn into Batman and Tim Drake cant turn into Robin that would be really cool. The flash should be able to turn into 'Lightning Flash' witch makes him go realy realy fast. though there is some things wrong i definitely recomend it 8/10",1

"In the spirit of the original Tell Tale games like Sam and Max, Deponia brings a great mix of adventure and comedy to the classic point and click genera. Puzzles are thought provoking yet solvable without the aid of a walkthrough. The art is cartoonish but pleasing to the eye, and the characters are lovable and fun. If you’re a fan of comedy and point and click adventure games then I cannot advise the Deponia trilogy enough.",1
great game,1
Liking it so far. If anyone has any issues with it loading or being slow. Maybe you cant even get steam to download it? Try adding it to the exlusion section in windows defender! This worked for me. For some reason windows defender blocks it! Thumbs up so others can see!,1
"I cannot believe that its finnaly out on Steam! I' ve been playing this game for 3 years and I am still hooked to this game! Even if this game is difficult, I recommend this game for its interesting concept!  I know that I sound too excited about this, but really. It is a real surprise for me that this game actually reached the Steam release! (Simply because Steam, at that time, was really strict about what games they would release for us)  Have fun guys!",1
"UPDATE: Game is dead. No players, no servers. Save your money for something else. I did enjoy it while it lasted.   OUTDATED: Very good game. Once a few more patches and updates come out along with the DLC that already has an in-game menu, it will be the best game around and will give Call of Duty a run for it's money. Not gameplay wise, but sales wise.",-1
Dis game is hard but fun. Very satisfying to pull off da jukes or just to blow a zombie's head off. 10/10,1
The first fighting game to truely recapture that MVC2 feeling. Plus it's the ultimate waifu fuel.,1
"It's everything I've always wanted!  I'm a fan of realistic military simulators, so I might be a little biased towards this type of game. But I just love it. The suppression effects, the beautifully rendered 3D scopes, the customization, the online maps, the community, it's all great.  Pros:  - Incredibly fun - Forced teamwork - Unlike in COD or BF, if an enemy is covering a door with an MG or an alley with a sniper rifle, you CANT engage them head-on and hope for the best. In COD or BF, you have enough hitpoints that you can sprint through, jump around a bit, and out-gun them. This game forces teamwork. If an MG enemy is covering a door that you need to get through, one team member will take pot shots at them to bait them and keep them from moving, while the others go around to try a different route. Or you could use a flash-bang or grenade, but they will usually see that coming and prepare. - Beautiful graphics, with forgiving performance (I've only got a Radeon HD 5770 and 4GB of ram, and i get 60fps@1080) - A focus on the immersive, adrenaline-pumping aspects of realism, while forgoing the boring, tedious aspects of realism - Bullet penetration depending on bullet size, velocity, and material hit - Surprisingly large community with lots of low ping, high player-count servers (many servers full of 32 players) - Genius map layout, every square inch of every level appears to be designed for maximum fun, but also maximum immersion - Respawns - There are game modes that do not have respawns, but the most common ones have a complicated respawn system where you can earn a respawn wave by capturing a point/completing an objective, and then there is a 30-60s delay until that wave respawns; sometimes you start the game with 2 waves in the bank already. - An excellent player-vote system - you can call a vote for anything from kicking a player, to changing maps, to scrambling the teams - No rampant authoritarian mods - there is an in-game system for reporting mod abuse!  Cons: - Comparably limited weapon selection (~20) - I've been spoiled by CoD and BF's massive weapon selection - 'Wall hack' spotting system - Using the C button on the keyboard, you can open up a radial menu to give commands and orders. If you open the radial menu while facing an enemy, the default speech command selected will be 'enemy spotted'. This does not take bushes or hedges into account, nor distance. So if you're not sure if theres an enemy hiding in that bush, or if that tiny little dot 300m away is an enemy, just press C on him, and if it says 'Enemy spotted', you'll know. Thankfully, spotting an enemy only puts a red box over their last known location for you and all your teammates to see, and the red box does not follow them around.  - A confusing class-based system - Useful for making sure you don't have 31 other snipers to play against, but its a first-pick first-serve basis, the person with the fastest loading time &amp; ping gets the first pick; it hinders your ability to experiment and try out new weapons because first you have to wait for it's class to open; Some of the classes seem redundant or synonyms (IE there is a 'soldier' class, a 'militant' class, and a 'fighter' class all on the same team), and they're not self-explanatory - You don't know what a class entails until you click it. - No minimap - Because there is no UI whatsoever, this means there is no minimap. Now, I don't want a radar with little blips that tell me where the enemies are at all times, that would break the immersion. But considering that I can already see my teammates through walls as little blue diamonds, why can't I see them on a map in the corner of my screen instead? It makes it a real grind to learn the map layouts, and learning the map layout is key to success. - For some reason, you can bunny-hop forever. At no point do you become too tired to jump. It's a slow jump, it takes a full second or two between jumps, and nobody seems to abuse it online, but you could, if you wanted to. - Nothing to unlock - all weapons and attachments are available to you at the start of the game. It's nice to see a game that tries to be fun without resorting to addictive mental trickery, but it would be nice to be able to unlock a player or weapon skin, or speech, or some way to show off that you're not a newbie.  All in all, I highly reccomend this game for any FPS simulator fans! It's one of the very best!",1
"So, a few months ago, I think Bundlestars snuck this in with the Apogee Retro Pack for like $5 and I couldn't resist. Overall, that pack had 40 games in it, including Halloween Harry and all the pre-DNF PC Duke Nukem Games. That was enough nostalgia to get me to bite, and so I wound up with this in my inventory.  I'm trying to figure out a way not to be mean to this game. I really, really, am. But see, I played 40 minutes of this right now and something about it made me feel irritated enough to the point where I actually got a little physically ill.  That, for me, is a very strange reaction to have towards anything, let alone a game. I think I can explain how this happened, though.  In order for an FPS about being a hardcore awesome mage to work, you need a few things.  1) Spells should have an obvious visceral impact.  2) Controls should respond to the slightest movement.  3) Menus and interfaces should be intuitive enough to ensure you're rarely out of the action.  Lichdom: Battlemage, for me, achieved none of those things.  Instead, what I got was a game that very badly wanted to be both an exciting nonstop action mage FPS, but also a reasonably complex RPG with deep crafting elements. Lichdom seems to have succeeded somewhat in being a Frankengame because it happens to end up with the worst elements of a shooter, and an RPG.  The game gives up on explaining its own menus pretty quickly, leaving you to figure a good amount of the game out, and the controls feel somehow like you're always acting on some serious input delay.  Part of me feels bad for not carrying on and giving the game a fairer shake, but I simply cannot enjoy a shooter in which launching a fireball takes a noticeable delay after I click, and has all the impact of a feather duster when it actually reaches its target. Enemies simply POOF out of existence with a little puff of smoke. Physics attached to enemy gibs could have really made all the difference here, but the system as-is feels somehow weak. For a supposedly tough-as-nails mage, I was left wondering why it felt as though my spells merely tickled my opposition until the game decided to replace them with a 'dead pile of bones' texture on the ground.  The more I type, the more I'm reminded of that feeling in the pit of my stomach. Lichdom has a lot of great ideas, and that makes it all the more upsetting. It looks nice, but it's static. It aims to revitalize Hexen, but it fails to feel fast or responsive. It tries to tell a mystical story, but its voice acting and writing is all over the place.  These disappointments, and others like them, leave me with this uneffable sensation that enough is enough, and 40 minutes is all I can take. I simply can't get into this. Lichdom has the best of intentions, but intentions and ability to follow through are very, very different things.",-1

"I played the original King's Bounty on the Sega Genesis a LOT. It was one of those games with random spawning treasure and monsters; the castle's were always in the same place but the villains inside of them would randomize on new games.

"If you like the stealth genre then you know good games are hard to come by. Dishonored is one of my favourites and Styx comes close. This is strange because honestly, this game has so much going against it.  Cons -  Terrible combat system (that's fine, because it's a stealth game, but the game still forces you into narrative combat that is unbearably frustrating.) Really sketchy/buggy platforming bad controls an average story that could have been done better poor quality cut scenes terrible voice work (other than Styx, who I found entertaining.  Despite all this game has done stealth right. On Goblin difficulty, everything kills you pretty much instantly. There is almost no combat, because you simply die if you're caught. It's a really nice difficulty to put into a game for people who want to play a real stealth game. I also think the entire premise is just really interesting. You are severely underpowered, you are a 3 foot tall Goblin and pretty much everything else towers over you. You really have to use some ingenuity to get around that challenge. On sale this game is an exceptional deal, but I probably would be willing to pay full price now that I know how enjoyable it is.",1

Trying to keep your job, your family alive and happy all the while making sure your country stays safe and secure is an intense but fun little adventure. A good game for anyone, it's easy to pick up and play but gets quite indepth as you advance which will keep you busy for hours on end.",1

The game can be a bit frustrating at times however, there are stupid bugs, the players can be very incompetent ( Obviously not a fault with the game, but it's still frustrating ) The combat is quite clunky and you can get stuck on walls and doors trying to fight in CQB engagements and the AI have incredible aim it's like they have an aimbot.   But considering the price of this game and the amount of great moments I've had in it, it's definitely worth your money and time",1

I hope the next game by Supergiant Games is released soon and is just as awesome as this one.",1

First off the game can run on a factory PC with 4 gb of ram, no graphics card, and an i3 proccessor allthough its not too bad, and the drifting is great, I mean its better than grid 2 drifting and compares to autosport. The only unfortunate thing about the game is that it has no badge that comes with it.",1

Practically never give reviews out, even if the game's bad. But this one is better than a score in the 70s, so I'm giving it a thumbs up.  The gameplay is what matters for a game, and this game's gameplay is fantastic in SP. Though the MP, of course, still needs some tweaking, CA has done a fantastic job making sure most of the factions have a chance vs. each other, and has taken steps in the right direction (even if they might be too little, it's better than too much!)  I happily will buy all the DLC this game gives out because I love the core game that much.",1

It was amazingly epic. This game is really addicting but every game has its cons sadly. But there's really only 3 i can mention, so I will just name 3 of each of my biggest cons and pros.  Cons: -Short gameplay. Even 'Epic' setting isn't long. I don't like that the king auto dies after a period of time. At least let him retain one HP or have an option to turn rot off on King or something.  -Map can feel small. It has some random generation but 4 heroes + 2 - 5 kings guards and banes (or even more) all at once can make it feel congested. That means lots of battles, which can be hard on people trying to be more stealthy. It might be just my lack of experience so far, but it seems flat out battling with decent equipment is the way to go. Did a round as the Wolf and never died once with a defensive build while managing to kill off most people by sacrificing saved up cards for +damage rolls when I felt needed to.  -Lack of customization. I don't think there really needs to be one but it would be nice if we could, say, create a custom with our own name of choosing, cycle models and pick the one we like most then pick a playstyle or something. Either way, implemented or not I enjoy the current characters a lot.   Pros: -Creativity. Man does creativity come into play or you could find yourself surrounded by enemies. It's not a bad idea to draw some spell cards or trickery cards to lower someones HP or find a way to make a quick getaway.  -Battles can get intensive and the world change instantly. You can go from peaceful to people surrounded by banes and guards going after player bounties. I love the complete randomness of it! Even quests are never a promised reward.  -Freedom and Politics. Politics can change the flow of the game. And I love going from being the prestigious kings right hand man to stabbing him in the throat the next turn for fun.  In the end, this game is amazing. It's random, can change in a flash, and when you get into it you can FEEL the struggle sometimes. Seriously, worth the pay.",1
If Streetfighter had a Puzzle Baby it would be this game.,1
The most fun I had with this game was uninstalling it.,-1
I diss this game coz I suck at it! T_T  After pondering over more hours..  (Damn! I suck too bad... T____T THIZ GAME SUXZZZ),-1
"Fun solo, amazing with friends. 9/10.",1
Really adorable and realistic :'D,1
"The game used to be good.... now it keeps getting worse (pre 1.4/1.5)  EDIT:  The game has improved SIGNIFICANTLY:  -Generous loot changes -Rebalancing both gear (weapons, armor etc etc) and enemies to the effect that once properly geared, it feels much less of a bulletspongy enviroment and more of a quasi-realistic shooter. -New content such as weapons, survival gamemode, new gear sets to provide more versatile roles for the type of character you want i.e support, assault and ranged -Optimization tweaks, running a smoother gameplay experience on a GTX 970m laptop   I'd recommend waiting till the Thanksgiving/Black Friday/Cyber Monday/Christmas Sale to pick this game up. There's quite a fair bit of value now compared to when it was first released!  If you've watched AngryJoe's review, I'd bump that end score to a solid 8/10.",1
"A great survival game, balanced and challenging  So if you're looking for an entertaing game with a thoursand ways to die this is it!",1
An exellent improvement of the already amazing game of D.O.T.A.,1
"Only in beta and has more care and work put into it than most completed 'big games'.  Some interesting small yet amazing details I found include:  - Lessons in the Dwarven Language  -Hilarious and consistent dialouge between characters  - Lots of interesting lore if you look in the right places.   - Every time you boot up the game, the title screen plays a different series of Scaven sounds  - The Scaven will hiss insults at you sometimes, such as 'Witch hunter!' and I swear one called me a 'B!@#%'  - Characters interact well with pick-ups, having different things to say about potions, bandages, even the grimoires you find.   Not a true full out reveiw maybe..but I can't get enough of this bloody game, it's so great for a beta! It has a few bugs still and the content is rather short. Only 4 maps as time of writing, 2 of which are rather straightforward, the other 2 require a bit of exploring, which is fun. Loads of weapon types to choose between, and did I mention that there is a fat happy dwarf? Yes, that right there makes the game 10/10. Fat. Happy. Murderous. Dwarf.",1
It is the best strategie game on the market that I've ever played. Keep it up guys you are doing a great job.  Many thanks to the COH 2 Team.  It sure would be nice if we could have more free stuff because we do own the game.,1
Amazing story AND soundtrack. I cried a lot and you should also cry a lot. SO JUST BUY THIS GAME PPL  11/10 would buy again,1
Quiet breathes through her skin therefore she must be wearing virtually nothing... Hideo Kojima you`ve done it again. 10/10,1
love it. everything about it. everything you'd want in a game,1
This game let me know every friends from each country ;),1
Great zombie survival game. I'm really enjoing this one.,1
"If you like Visual Novel and 2D Fighting games, buy this game, do it.  It is worth every penny/dollar/yen/guil/everything you have in your wallet.   ----------  Edit: On a serious note, the game is great and the roster while rather small, every character is unique in its own way. Story is pretty hard to understand until you play all the routes of every character (so this means you have to replay the same character two or three more times to get 100% and also save often!). Since its a visual novel, expect lots of text to read.  Sprites are also 720p, i would strongly recommend to set the resolution to 1280x720p either arcade or full. The only downside, there is a 30fps bug. To resolve this problem just reboot your computer.  However, if you are going to buy this game remember that the online BB community is on the latest blazblue game, which would be Chronophantasma Extend. If you want to know the Calamity Trigger story, there are two options: buy Continuum Shift Extend (it has a summarized chapter with all the routes of every character combined without gags) or read the story on blazblue wiki.",1
"If you like the Total War franchise and Warhammer universe then this game is an absolute must, the character stories are fun and add a different dinamic to the game, the races are varied enough to make it entertaining (Chaos and Vamps are my particular favourites), so all in all a very good experience, Radious mod is a must in my opinion but hey its just that, an opinion. Fun part is the mod community is active and there are some fun things to try out and mess about with in game.   As for people moaning about DLC, i'm 50/50 on that, pirating has made companies wary and most have had enough so i kind of get the constant update, content etc. Look at you back burner and if you can afford it don't think twice, new characters and stories are refreshing as are the Beastmen and the mini campaign (death to humans), on the other side the game map looks absolutely massive and there are huge areas just covered in a grey fog......DLC might end up being of the charts......Mix a few key races like elves and would love to see Naval warfare in game (something that warhammer developed quite nicely).   Buy, enjoy and spread chaos.   Oh and we want Skaven.........",1

"Pathetic Pc Port anad generally bad game. I wil admit the console version is not that bad but this is another story. System requirments are outrageuos, its ugly, horrible framerat, max 80 FOV. don't even think about it",-1
Best of Total Wars series with most epic world of WARHAMMER 10/10,1
if you do as i do game/ vide o game/ opinion wise u are in for a real treat . of bad,1
One of the best games i have ever played. It gots everything. The game play is awesome. A lot better than previous gameplays but the only problem is its complex but maybe to complex. I liked the Mediaval 2 total war campaign for reasons like it was complex but not to over the top to confuse. Overall this game is very fun and i can play for hours.,1
Anything you want to do in this game is done better somewhere else. It's one of my last resort games I rarely touch.,-1
  DLC unlock everything. Online mode is laggy and unplayable unless you're playing with friends that live in the same state as you.,-1
"I WILL update this later, first 5 minutes or so I am impressed with the image produced by my 270x. This game uses 100% of my quad core amd a10 in a room with 2 guys, be ready for a struggle if you have a weeker cpu I am upgrading to an 8320 today.",1
"Good story. The main character isn't a broody judy like Connor was in ACIII. Unlike most, I actually enjoy the modern-day segments. The world is rich and the pirate aspect was great. This game could've been just a pirate game with no Assassin's Creed and I think it'd have done great - if you like AC or just like pirates, this game is a good buy.",1
"So Test Drive Unlimited 2 is a game that has been out for a long time now, and I still remember the excitement when playing it for the first time; now almost 5 years after the release of the game I still find it pretty fun and exciting to play! I love the ability to just sit in a car, plug in a steering wheel and drive around Ibiza without having to race, listening to amazing and calm soundtrack, and if I want to race I just progress through the story. I have to admit the game does not have as much people playing it anymore, but the game is very old. The servers occasionally go down, but Eden Studios is doing their best to keep the servers up. I do still recommend the game, and if anyone is having a problem running the game there are go arounds on the forums, you just need to search for them.",1
Do not purchase if you are using windows 7. The game does not work and I could not get the fix from the forum to work. You will be just throwing your money away.,-1
all u hav 2 do is make farms n build stuf its so gud lol,1
"Thought this game would be some what like Renegade Ops but boy was I wrong, the game is very repetitive and gets boring after a while, it's also very short (I guess it's a good thing because the game isn't really that good) The AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times too. Achievements are also pretty easy to unlock, I got 100% without even trying to do them.",-1
"The game itself is a great idea: Counter Strike with high speed car chases. However, it seems that not much has been accomplished over the 3 years that it has been out. The graphics are bad, even for the Source engine. Also, the gun variety is pretty small. There is pretty much no optimization. Since the developers have not put in the effort to get this game going (engine update, optimization, etc) people have pretty much abandoned the game. The only servers are in Europe and Russia (Even then they have a very limited amount of people playing). Aside from all the negitives, the game is very fun. I especially love the VIP car escort mode. If the devs decide to put in the necessary time to get this game up to par, then I would, without a doubt, recommend this game. Even if you do decide to get this game with its current state, be prepared to play with a community of 100 or less players on European or Russian servers only. In short, this seems like a cops and robbers mod, quickly thrown together for Garry's Mod or the original Counter Strike game. I tried it, saw the potential, but uninstalled after about 3 hours as it looks like it isn't going to be fixed and there just aren't many people to play with.",-1
"Alright so.  Elsword Elsword Elsword...  What i like:  What can i say this game is one of its kind the gameplay the style the look and feel of the controles are well, Unipue. 2 - 3 years ago I never played a game like this before it was truely a keeper for me i left alot for months but the drive to leveling up more always brings me back to it i am a fan of Anime/Manga and this game is one for me i love it. the controles are easy to get use to dont believe me try going to Spar ingame and asking for help theres always someone there to help you no matter the situation whether it be a question on how to level up or 'where do babies come from' someone will give you a funny remark or just stay with you to see what others say. What can i say the simplest of things make this game all the more entertaining.  What i dont like:  Now what i dont like about this game is there are alot of childish kids that love to how say 'Troll' others and PVP for me is uhm well i admit i lagg and win some times i mean im not always the one lagging but i still get blamed for it, its a real put off alot of rage on this game happens people spamming you saying you will get banned its just annoying and others say you spamming skills its cheating *facepalm*, it is hard to find that one player to hangout with and just play the game enjoy the world of elsword with. When you do find people to play with the game is fun but for me it was hard to find people i can really call friends on this because its rear to find a nice person theres ALOT of trolls so so so so many and most of them just try get your rear items or k-ching out of you it really bothers me.  As of now i only play this game for my girlfriend she likes it so i stick with it.  If you're new and want some advice i'll do my best to help just dont ask me for ♥♥♥♥ aight Peace.  IGN: SirWoodz Level 70 RuneSlayer~",1
the best coop game ever!!!!,1
"What to say about this game that wasn't already said? This game is a terribly good mix beetween dark souls and bloodborne. In my opinion, it is by far the biggest and most entertaining dark souls I've played. Sadly, there is the problem that my computer isn't as good as it used to be and it doesn't run nearly as smoothly as I'd want it to. Yet, this game is great. I've enjoyed every second of it and I will enjoy it more as I achievement hunt the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.  As I've seen, lots of people shared personnal stories so I will go ahead and share my own...  I invaded a person that had two summons in the tower against the wall in lothric, after a lot of fighting and desperatly struggling to survived, I jumped down into the zone with the halberd undead, they quickly killed him off but I've had the luck of healing up before the fight resumed... Little did I know, one of the summons had firebombs and kept flinging them at me from a distance. assumed it was a great plan to damage me from a safe distance.. Little did he know though.. There was a few oil barrels laying around the place and he blew himself up along with his two friends and me. I got the kill though so that's all fun and games.",1
I love this game but one of the downsides is that the late game can be a bit grindy,1
"Note : Review in progress. These are initial impressions, will update once I finish the game. Beware lot of negative reviews just because game has MT. Little do they know that microtransaction are only for in-game money, praxis kits - paid cheat codes/trainer. You need not even care about them and play through the game. After its a single player and no content is locked behind microtransaction so who cares. The game is super awesome don miss it.  If you are having fps issues : Turn off MSAA and put volumetric lighting to ON (instead of ultra). Turn off Contact hardening shadows also. Crash at train station : put settings at low, go to windowed mode. (Now fixed in patch)  Game is totally brilliant. The gameplay is so awesome, improved in every way from Human Revolution. The movement, cover system, new augmentation system everything feels so cohesive and makes the gameplay great. The level design is great, with each building having a layered design which can be traveresed by us.. This offers a good amount of freedom to carry out the missions.The side missions have their own characters, story which make playing them very fun.  The city is filled with secrets for us to explore and the story also builds up very nice. So nice to be back as Jensen again !! Totally recommended to anyone who love exploration, stealth based games.. and for anyone who loved Deus Ex HR, must buy.  I have i5-4570, 16gb ram, GTX 960 4GB. At high preset am getting 38-50 fps. The game runs very smooth. So happy that I can play in high.  Yes I know there are stupid idiotic microtransactions which I hate. But be assured, this is a single player game and they are not going to affect our gameplay in any single way, its totally optional (like it was in Rise of Tomb Raider). We should blame Square Enix for that. But what the devs- Eidos montreal have made here is a genuinely awesome game that we should experience and appreciate :)",1
"This game is immensely fun, beautiful, and has a very broad story with lots of lore that only requires the player to listen and observe their surroundings to piece together the past of Lordran. The difficulty is over hyped in my opinion, but it is still fun and challenging which is extremely refreshing nowadays.",1
"Great Game, much content and the varieties of builds you can do is incredible 10/10",1
Simply the best local multi-player game ever made...,1
Better than diablo 3 nuff more to say.,1
"My favourite game of all time,( ok maybe not this specific version). Now if only I could get the complete HOMM 3 collection in HD like this I might never need another game.  If you didn't play this way back when, this is a great version to try.",1
"A great tense rogue-like. It kind of feels like a horror game. Has an interesting story that you can discover by reading terminals. Has a crafting system and a number of different weapons and enemies. It is *very* hard though. You WON'T beat it for a long time, there is a high chance that you will rage.  8.5/10",1
"It's a good game, between average and good but it sure has it flaws. First of all, it uses a tactical fighting system, it's nothing like The Elder Scroll, Two Worlds, Gothic, Risen, The Witcher, or whatever you want to name. It's kind of similar to Baldur's Gate, but not as good. You'll have to pause the game and use tactics to win the fights. I play on the hardest difficulty and I do have to use tactics a lot, it's still easy but without those tactics, I would probably die too easily. I do not know about easier difficulties since I first started the game on the highest difficulty.  At first, I must admit that I've excepted a real time gameplay like Risen or even The Elder Scrolls, but it's nothing like that, I sure was disappointed, but it's good anyway, as long as you like this kind of gameplay. The story is good, nothing like the original but it's good. The animations are horrible though, play the game and see by yourself.  In the end, it's nothing revolutionary but it's good if you're a fan of Game of Thrones and tactical RPG with real time pause.  7.5/10",1
"A really fun Voxel-Based MMO, A bunch of weapons and gear and allies and mounts, and lots of biomes with lots of enemies for you to fight. There are also dungeons in which you fight through a hoard of enemies until you get to the end, which is where the boss is. After you kill the boss, a chest appears and after breaking it you get loot :) A fun game that I would recommend to everyone",1
"Simply an outstanding game, regardless if you've played the legends of old school pc rpgs or not. If you're itching for a good roleplaying experience, this title will deliver to the fullest. I'm glad I don't have a ton of free time to play it because it would easily have me hooked in for a while. Certainly seems like one of those games that you always come back to and play once in awhile when you're in the mood for playing a good game.  Easily worth the 40 dollars, though you can get it cheaper elsewhere. Its value in my opinon measures much higher than most 60 dollar games on the market, so I'd say it's a good deal. Heck I've spent more time in character creation in this game, than I've spent with some games all together.   9/10 until some minor tweaks to pathing and combat nuances are patched in. Once combat feels a tad more intuitive, it's an easy 10/10.  EDIT: Review was initial thoughts at game's release. I've jumped back into the game now that it's patched up and content complete with expansions.   It is indeed a 10/10 in my eyes. I don't play the game out of nostalgia for games like BG and NWN. Those were great games for their time, and still hold up today for people who are really interested in them. But for our current time, I believe Pillars is a better game by today's standards. It's not fair or accurate to compare today's standards with the past.  On it's own, Pillars is a great game. So much detail was put into this game. What orginially threw me off during release was the combat. Particularly no combat AI. And combat jsut seemed messy. Now with patch 3.0, the combat is much more fluid and their is party AI. Nothing like DA:O, but still helpful.   Seems pathing is better, I remember a big issue with that on release.  Lots and lots of replay value. The world is interesting, lots of classes to chose from (No dual classes though), and a good pace to game especially early on which is important. You can get a comfortable grip fairly quickly which is great if you consider multiple runs through the game.  Good amount of challenge with the difficulty settings if you like that sort of thing.  You get your own stronghold that you can upgrade and manage. Not super in-depth, but satisfying to watch it grow.  There are a lot of stats in this game. It seems overwhelming at first, but they are very simple in practice. You don't really need to memorize it all, since the game does a great job with having descriptions at the ready, for everything.  Characters are for the most part, extremely uninteresting and bland. In my opinion I have no desire to carry out their quests. Thankfully the game gives you the option to create characters for your party, including the starting stats, which from a role play and/or powergame perspective is better anyways.  Story is interesting. The whole watcher thing seems weird at first but it kind of plays into the lore of the game. The premise is pretty weak in my eyes but it fleshes out nicely. It's somewhat confusing for a little while but I guess it's supposed to be.  Lots of text. I personally prefer text instead of audio dialogue unless the voice acting is really really good like Witcher 3. There is quite a bit of voiced dialogue too, mostly just one liners and such, but also idle banter between companions now and again which I do like a lot.  Combat is incredible. There is a lot going on but you have the ability to pause at any time to issue commands. Rewards strategic thinking. On lower difficulties you can just right click to win like an ARPG, but higher difficulties will require you to put some thought into your actions.  Overall great game. Graphics, animations, audio all good. Best modern tradiitional RPG in my opinion.",1
"It only took me about 80 minutes to beat, but I had a blast with this great little game! It's not too hard but not  too  easy, the pixel art pops and the jaunty chiptunes keep things jumping along. Would buy another from MiniBoss!",1
"As of February 11, 2014:  I consider this a day when I can give an overall review, finally, without having to conditionalize much of what is said. After almost 500 hours, 4 completed campaigns, and a tremendous number of patches, I can safely assume the game is actually close to what should have been it's initial release state.  * * *  The game at release was a disaster. Total War games tend to have slight hiccups at release, but Rome II had flat-out design flaws. Initially, there were capture points in open field battles. Even when you were on the defensive. And those capture points were often just toward the center of the map. That is such a silly design flaw that, even though it got patched out of the game almost immediately, it sets a tone for what to expect.  And then the bugs. Naval bugs were so numerous at first that it seems they barely play-tested the new feature of combined land-sea battles, as units disembarking could become glitched, and numerous other bugs were prevalent. Siege bugs were also quite numerous. And technical bugs, like large frames-per-second (FPS) drops, were common.  Now, most of the bugs are gone. And some design decisions, like open field battles having capture points, were fixed more-or-less quickly.   But it's still odd that very basic balance issues were not corrected until the last patch or two. Such as the fact that Praetorians used to cost only two or three hundred denarii more than Legionaries despite the massive stat boost Praetorians have. Or that chariots used to be fairly cheap units that could kill virtually anything. These issues only recently were fixed, despite being fundamental issues that a quick in-house beta would have detected.  But, finally, much of that is behind the game now. Only one slight design flaw remains: one turn is equal to one year, meaning that agents and generals die fairly quickly (if you get them initially around age 25, they might live for 50 turns before dying of old age, but often less). This also means that there are no more seasons. But these are things I can live with personally, and if you really want to change these issues up, there are both mods that can do this as well as an expansion (Caeser in Gaul) that includes a campaign that does have more turns per year as well as seasons.  For what it is, after all of that, we have a rather good game. It's nice to be back to a Total War game where there are different sides. Shogun 2, for all its strengths, did tend to suffer from a lack of unit variety: in that game, which basically was all about civil wars in various eras of Japan, you were stuck with one set of units for each campaign, and the only difference between factions was what bonuses you got for certain units in that set. Only much later was there a DLC to add a single unique unit to each faction, a la Civ V.  And Rome 2 includes a reasonable mercenary system to augment the faction-specific units, allowing you to buy far more expensive versions of a select number of other factions' units.  Rome 2 diplomacy is better than Shogun 2's, in some minor ways. Now you can trespass in foreign territory and suffer diplomatic penalties with that territory's owner rather than just be blocked by a force-field until you get military access. And sides form alliances in ways that are a bit more understandable.  Rome 2 also features army traditions, which are a way of giving bonuses to units with a device that can't be killed or destroyed: even if the army with that tradition falls, it can be reinstated and new units added to the army to get the bonuses.  Which brings me to the last of two changes: unlike Shogun 2, all units have to be under a commander and in an army, now. No more breaking off two or three units to scout ahead, or buying units to sit in a town and act as a garrison. While this could be argued to be a design flaw, I see it as more of a design choice: in real life, it would be strange to have just one unit of levied men running around commander-less in the country side.   And the other change is that land units can now embark on water without needing a navy. Again, some might see that as a step back, but it makes more sense than a single gunboat in Shogun 2 being able to transport a 1,000 man army on it.  Overall, Rome 2 has a fair number of improvements that were hard to notice until recently because of the horde of bugs. The game is finally worth it's initial price, though I suspect the base price will drop shortly since it's been half a year. And the developers were at least aware enough of the mistakes they made that the game received heavy patching and that consumers received what was likely intended as paid DLC for free because of the issues.  None-the-less, because of the fiasco of the early days, I have to say I can't give more than a B- to the overall experience I've had with Rome II. It's probably today about a B+ if you are looking to get a rather good strategy game. But, initially, it was a solid D and only after a lengthy period of patching has it become what it is today, which is a solid strategy game with just a couple nagging flaws.   ADDED (9/12/2014):  -- My editorial on PC Gamer and Rome II --   PC Gamer Very Recently, While Mentioning the Emperor Edition:  'After a troubled start, Rome 2 is now in a much better place—its patches and tweaks fixing many, if not all, of the community's major issues.'    PC Gamer During the 'Troubled Start':  '85/100'   Now, Rome 2 TODAY, as of 9/122014, probably actually is getting closer to earning that 85/100 score. CA has done a lot to win back the communty and rectify mistakes (i.e.: adding content to Beasts of War, adding a campaign for free, offering DLC for free, etc.). But I've lost all faith in PC Gamer. I mean, at launch, this game was indeed suffering major issues... issues that PC Gamer took note of only well after the fact (around BoW they at least noted that BoW was not well-received).  My advice to CA, along with other studios = just let consumers play a demo. Provide us a demo, because obviously the 'professional reviewers' are, in the very least, incompetent. I am suggesting this because experiences with the industry lately have led me to swear-off pre-ordering anything that lacks a playable demo.  And my advice to consumers = video game review magazines are clearly going full-Rolling Stone these days. Either play a demo of the game, or wait until two months after release; there's no trusting the 'professional reviewers' anymore. Pre-ordering is insanely foolish these days, and even buying in during the first month likely means just waiting another month or two for absolutely vital patches.   Honestly, Rome II has shown what garbage PC Gamer is, and PC Gamer was my gold standard once upon a time.",1

You can feel the SimCity vibe but with more detailed and polished gameplay. Game runs smoothly on my laptop with High setting were other newer games fail.  Only found 1 bug so far. You can also feel that it's a successor to Cities In Motion cities by giving more command to transportation system than in any other city builder game.  My first evening with it was very enjoyable and I will say this: First game in the last few years that I'm satisfied with (although yes there are few things missing for because I'm a Cities In Motion fan).,1

So after that in dephts 2 i find my item room with an weird item, i picked it, FU**** SOY MILK.  Best game 11/10  Now trying to play really hard to achieve real platinum god, and i always die at the frickin cellar 2 by a spider or the haunt when playing as the lost. Rage my self and break my keyboard now playing really bad :c  But after all of this, best game of my entire life, so many items, bosses, secrets, brimstones, mom's knife and such RAGES!",1
"Really well made dungeon crawler/ tower defense experience, quite challenging and fun to play with tons of replay value, i rate it 8/10.",1
"Updated 12-12: I am going to have to change my vote. I cannot recommend this game at this time. It has too many 'show stopper' bugs in it. I do not say this lightly but this is the buggiest game since Empire Total War came out years ago. You can see I have invested HUNDREDS of hours with this game. From crashes that remind me of Microsoft's 'blue screen of death', to crippling war weariness that never ends, or AI that seems to go nuts with little rhyme or reason. I started playing Sid Meier games back when Alpha Centauri came out. I expect better QA testing than what they have released. Wait 6 months or after the 1st major upgrade before you buy.   Original: Like many, I would say wait until the first update/fix has been rolled out. Issues with AI and multiple prompt screens that cause the system to fail and crash. I have one game that at turn 400, yes..four hundred, that will no longer play and the game crashes.   From the AI standpoint, I have other rulers who 'denounce' me and I know not why. Early on in the game (like less than 50 turns) you will get ganged up on as multiple civs will declare war on you. They are not allied and some have barely even known you for a few turns but somehow, you are now the enemy. As I said, the AI has 'Issues'...",-1

"A surprisingly good story wrapped around a solid stealth/action game. Interesting choices and lots of secrets to find - basically catnip for a gamer like me. I did encounter bugs here and there, and the difficulty becomes trivial (even on the hardest setting) after you get enough Praxis (upgrade) points. Overall, though, a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",1
"Beautiful Game, very well optimised, smooth fluid combat and a very nice parkour system that is similar to Mirror's Edge. Although this looks like another game that's just trying to milk off money from the 'Zombie Game' Genre I assure you this game is great.",1
"Every time I play this I am reminded of the FIRST version of this game I bought that was exactly the same game with the same bugs. The scumbag in this developer is strong, well played.",-1
This game is amazing. Growing your village and customizing each person's equipment is probably my favorite thing about this game. Well worth the 20 dollars for the game and the 6 dollars for the downloadable content. i would gladly donate extra to the creators for making such a high quality and replayable game.,1
Game is a lot of fun with friends and a great time killer by yourself. Would recommend when its on sale since it doesnt seem to be everybody's cup of tea.,1
"its a cool retro typr game, and i think it is very good, great story line and chzracters, play this on full maxed out 4k pc and honestly love it. if you cannot start it for some people, disconnect the internet link, stgart the game and then reconnect your net connection. it should work fine. i rate this 8/10 i havent played the multi player stuff yet. but i will do.",1
"It's free, looks great and is fun. A bit slow with the pacing but is very fun with friends!",1
"Pretty stellar game that basically gives you the thrill of being what amounts to a script kiddie.  Sidenote: Game is riddled with gamebreaking bugs (e-mails not being sent out and whatnot) and even the possibility of your save file not working anymore. Once these bugs are fixed, it'll be a perfect game to play.",1
Can't figure out how to play this... No help on web site. Was pretty excited about this game - Steam you should not sell crap like this. Will try a refund today.,-1

"One of my all time favorites rom the PS1/PS2 era. Great story riddled with dark humor.  Supposedly there's an HD remake coming-but they did an HD remake of MDK2. Ignore my steam time played, on the Playstation I have beaten this game, and MD2, 3-5 times. 9/10",1
"This game was quite a disappointment. It really was severly oversold in terms of what you could do, and in the end just became a grinding game with no purpose or variety.",-1

"Was going to write a review, hit enter, got a message about not having a licence.  If you do decide to buy a 'licence' by subscribing you may think 'yes i can hunt every animal'. wrong! you have to have the right gun to shoot the right animal! which as you guessed it costs money.  Don't waste your time even if you are a hunting fan as this game is a scam! and it calls its self 'free to play'    1/10",-1
"“10/10 would seize again!” - The Joy of Stiqs  “A revolutionary tool.. [has been] invaluable in continued research” - National Epilepsy Diagnostics Foundation  “A true thriller that had me shaking in my boots.. and then in my chair.. followed shortly by the floor.” - PartialSandwich  Tasteless epileptic jokes aside, this game is fantastic. Beat Hazard is a twin-stick bullet-mayhem shooter very much akin to the Geometry Wars franchise. While the mechanics are quite similar, Beat Hazard makes the game your own by allowing your personal music collection to generate the levels you play.  The game comes with about 20 or 30 tracks (all of which are pretty awesome) but nothing quite compares to the screen going mental when the beat drops in your favorite song. Speaking of the screen going mental, I tend to be bemused by games that put the photo-sensitivity warning before the game begins. I don’t understand the mechanics by which a seizure is induced but typically games have that warning when the only light flickering is a lamp swinging and sparking from the ceiling. Beat Hazard on the other hand means business, I have never seen such chaos in all my life!  But here is the incredible part: the developers have masterfully balanced all the elements of the game so that even amidst all the chaos you know exactly what you’re doing. It was truly baffling to me when I played my very first game. I don’t know how they pulled it off but the design of this game is top notch. A must buy in my opinion!",1
very cool,1
awesome game! having lots of fun with Marvel characters,1
People that want to some what experiance battle feild 1 this is the game for you a lot of ww1 action more of trench war type no tanks and really hard! you will get what i mean when you start playing the game. I think the history on this is preatty good to so i reccomend.,1
"Dead state the game with potential that just simply falls short.  When i first saw this game i thought it would be a great game with micromanagable features to make everyones experience different and in a way it is but there is so much that is missing in this game to make it really great.   First of all if you are buying this game hoping for a breeze then you are FAR FROM IT. This game is challenging. Not just challenging but almost unplayable at points due to the general difficulty right from the start. Now i played this on its base difficulty with no \'iron man\' or \'survivor\' options enabled and this game is still ridiculously hard.   Don\'t get me wrong. I love a good challenging game, it makes me feel alive and puts me to the test. But this game takes it way too far as after a good 9 hours gameplay i still feel so weak against everything. I had 3 fully equiped survivors out on a mission but we got stuck in a room and only one could fight at a time meaning that the endless horde of zombies waiting very politely outside the door ended up getting the better of me ONE BY ONE.   Not only is it hard when it is supposed to be but the features it lacks makes it even more fustrating. Want your guys to take cover behind an obstacle to avoid missle fire? Nope. Want to climb on top of a nearby building to escape a zombie horde? Nope. Want to simply trade an item within your shelter to a friendly survivor? Nope.   These are just many of the infuriating events that can occur to you and happened to me basically every event. However this game isn\'t all bad. If you feel inclined to challenge yourself to the point you regretably put a hole through your monitor than be my guest because this game has so much to it and can be so much more. I just think that for a \'survival strategy\' there has to be some element of strategy other than just luck and using the right weapon.   Unfortunately the good outweighs the bad for this one so i simply can\'t recommend :(",-1

"Clicker Heroes, the game where you only have to click...and click...and click...and cli- oh wait, i can't get past this boss. If there was an okay rating, i would pick it for this game, this is a game similar to AdVenture Capatalist and Tap Tap Infinity etc. i thought this game used to be good, now i don't play it very often, first you'll probs think, 'Oh Hey! This is Pretty Fun!' but after a while... it gets really boring, you'll have to wait much, etc. and im stuck on a boss right now, i have really powerfull guys, (i'll just call them 'Helper's' for now instead.) but i just CAN'T manage to even hurt him! sooo yeah, like i was saying, i would rate this Okay, if there were an okay recommend button for this.    6/10 'I guess its kind of ok sometimes' -SwedishSmileosaur",1
DO NOT BUY THIS IT CAN WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS GAME IS HARD I HATE THE DOLLS GO FAST,-1
Incredibly fun! Worth more than the price it's asking for.,1
Love it,1
"BIT.TRIP Runner 2 is the sequel to the first runner game, and it offers graphical improvements as well as the addition of a backstory. This is both good and bad as the previous game left more to the imagination and was arguably cleaner in presentation. This game however is technically superior and offers additional features that make it the superior product. The general gameplay consists of endless running punctuated by input commands which help you navigate obstacles on your way to the finish line. The game is part platformer and part music box as completing actions successfully plays a certain tune as each action or obstacle has a distinct sound. The game is quite hard but its also an enjoyable experience which can also be played casually. A full recommendation, go run and get it.",1

"Okay, this game is pretty awesome. It has simplistic game play that I can't help but love. The music is awesome, the story is surprisingly in depth and intriguing, and over all I've enjoyed playing it. I highly reccommend.",1

"Love this game, classic from when i was a young PC gamer",1
"To be honest, this game really surprised me. Yes it's true, the hitboxes are big, the weapons are weak. But the gameplay is something that is unique to Counter-Strike: Source, And that's why this is my favourite Counter-Strike game.  +Fun Gameplay +Hundreds of servers +Numbers of gamemodes +Almost no russians  -Big hitboxes -People are either very bad or very pro at the game",1
"This was a really good story with okay gameplay. I like getting my mind blown metaphorically, and BioShock Infiite delivers. Almost every part of this game is amusing or interesting in som form or another.  For an 11 hours game I wouldn't pay too much for this game, but it's well worth it if you can get it on sale. At least it's worth the same amount as you would pay for a movie-ticket.",1
"WARNING: This game is locked to 30 FPS for the multiplayer portion. The campaign runs at smooth 60 FPS.  Pros: - Coat of polish to the old and recycled assets from previous games to make them look good.  - The cybertron half of the game is great. - Top notch voice acting - uhhh...  Cons: - Difficulty spikes. Sometimes you have to fight little drones which are like over powered aimbots. They have extremely high accuracy, very small hit box, and very high rate of fire and damage. - 'Cinematic' 30FPS for multiplayer portion (it is locked at 30 FPS. No way to change it. Tried altering V-sync but to no avail) - Recycled animations/models/multiplayer maps - Cut scenes are so bad its funny - Grainy low-resolution cut scenes - Unfinished details in environment - Only 2 new earth multipayer maps, both of which are very small - They didnt bother to recycle/add more maps, making the game feel lacking in content for a full priced game - New assets (eg. models/textures/FX/Animtions) look like cheap ♥♥♥♥ - Very little new content, most content is recycled - Campaign is very short - There is no PvP competitve multiplayer, only 4 player coop horde mode (Escalation) - Escalation is only 15 waves  If you are huge transformers fan and are willing to look past these flaws, pirate the game, see if you like it, then buy it if you like it.",-1
"absolutely one of the most tense gaming experiences I've ever had. the sheer terror never quite fades, though it is diluted a bit over time. even late in the game, while I felt more confident sneaking around when the xenomorph was nearby, I never let down my guard. the vulnerability you feel is as real as it comes. as an homage to the classic film, it does a fantastic job, and is the only alien-themed game to do so. while plenty of games have been released in the wake of later films, where the fact that these creatures can be killed became all too popular, the atmosphere of being trapped with limited resources, stalked by a lethal predator with no known weaknesses, is only now being placed into something interactive and tangible. the result is draining, but it maintains a mystique that never vanishes.",1

Too much brain usage,1
This is a fantastic game but there are so many performance issues it becomes borderline unplayable. The frame rate drops alone are just brutal. It lists in the specs a max supported frame rate of 60 fps but expect regular drops in the twenties and thirties during battles. This is a disappointing port of an otherwise excellent game.,-1
Bought it on sale for $3.75 Realized how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my computer is. Can't play it. One week later it was free on Humble Bundle. ♥♥♥♥. I hate everything.,1
"His game is just awesome! If you like open work games like GTA, great fighting mechnics like Batman:Arkham Knight and a post-nuclear scenario like Fallout, this is for game!",1
"Endless sandbox game , with a eerie tim burton style. nice",1
This is an awful game. The original AOS was decent but that changed until jagex took it over. Sure it got prettier but that doesn't mean better gameplay. The servers are all but empty and the basic premise of the game is flawed in the fact that the game was advertised to be a build and shoot when in reality there is very little building done at all in any o the servers. he game used to have an additional class that had a jetpack that was atually useable. But that was taken out for no reason at all. Wretched.,-1
This game is a blast. When it works.  Sometimes I get smooth gameplay. Sometimes I don't.   Somebody fix this game.,-1

"Great game, requires you to be a non SJW and also helps if you have ability to read Japanese.  I've read so many bickering reviews about this game and decided to add my 2 cents. I seriously started to wonder last couple of negative reviews were written by SJWs. I've seen worse romance novels with more unrealistic reasons for male chars to fool romance to have sex and don't see why this one has to be slammed so heavily.   This is a 'reading' game, not a stat game where main characters are most likely passive just like there are passive people in real life. Main character was raised without having to make any decision, because she was a princess. As she stated in-game women like her in her time period were often raised like that and got married off to nearby countries for peace. I also understand some may be upset because of how some endings end up the way they are but it is written that way - Americans are spoiled by medias that won't allow sad endings, learn to deal with it.  Also, with benefit of doubt I am guessing those who wrote negative reviews only had read the text in Japanese. Sadly for most of Dogenzaka games English text quality is not that great. I've either played almost all of Dogenzaka llabs games sold on Steam or had played most of them on smartphone(where language choice was only JPN) before so I know what exactly the way the text flows, and how it differs in English. While not everyone may not be happy with this game, or knows how to read Japanese, enjoy it as is.",1
"Crashes when you try to save, deleting previous saves in the process, making it impossible to finish. Literaly unplayeble.",-1
This is such a fun game. And to think it's still under development. Weaponcrafting is such a fun and amazing thing to creat an amazing weapon that's just suitable for your playing style. I highly recommend this game!,1
"Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of the best indie game created, verry original and complete, tons of items (weapons, spells and more), many things to know (the effect of the different shrines, ennemies pattern...)...

"Max Payne is a great classic. A 3rd person shooter with a unique slow motion mechanic that works greatly for it's time. The graphics were good back then, the soundtrack and sound effects are also nice and the story is envolving. And the gameplay is still good today, with fluid movements. Sure, the game is dated, but it's still fun today. But you need a custom patch to fix the game audio which is easily found online. With 3 difficulty settings and a time trial mode, there's enough replayability here. Get it on sale if you like this type of games.",1
Great Retro game. Loved playing it on the old xbox!,1
"If you like point and click games this is right up your alley. It has the same charm and humor of the point and click greats. The main character is a huge jerk and can say some pretty offensive comments, but it doesn't ruin the game or anything and just understand he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so you won't be triggered.",1
Good mod mixture of post apoctylptic survival,1
"Has a lot of bugs as of release that will have to be fixed to actually play the game correctly. The slow fps and graphics lags are only a bit annoying but the crashes happen at the most random spots making the game basically unplayable. I get half way through a story mission and it crashes, I go randomly run through the steeet it crashes. Im sure there will be a serious patch coming very soon since it seems everyone, regardless of computer specs, is having problems.  Other than that the gameplay overhaul of free running makes moving around on rooftops (without crashes) very fun and a bit of a newer feel since you have to hold down a or b to move up or down. A lot harder to get him to jump in a direction that is up or down in the complete wrong direction. Camera moves a bit too much in tight spaces, however and you end up jumping in the wrong direction but at least you dont have to climb back up because he randomly decided to jump down off of a building. Will still have to see how the fighting system improves with gameplay and stat changes, in the beginning its very slow because you can only attack 3 times.  So overall I would like to play more but the developers should have waited a few more months, tested A LOT more, and hashed out the bugs with the graphics and memory. Maybe after the new year would be a good time to get the game since HOPEFULLY they will have hashed out at least the crash bug. I recommend the game as an assassins creed fan but not a computer gamer FIX BUGS.  Running a MSi GT70 dominator laptop so i7, 16gb ddr3, and 870GTX gpu.",1

"Choplifter HD is a fun little game.  You fly your helicopter out on missions to rescue stranded soldiers, civilians, and even the odd media personality. Along the way you fight soldiers, insurgents - and even zombies!  It's a bit of an old-school side-scroller, which looks like it was based on an old helicpter rescue video game, circa 1980, but which has been updated to the year 2000. But if you don't mind that, it can be a good game.  The little comments made by your co-pilot can be amusing, such as: 'Time to pin the bullet on the terrorist'. 'Walk towards the light' (after I killed an armed insurgent). 'This is a chopper, not a battering ram' (a comment made after I crashed the heli a bit).  There were a few nice comments made whilst fighting the zombie hordes: 'I think I dated that zombie'. 'Can a zombie be a vegetarian?' 'I can't believe it, that's my Uncle Ted!' 'I wonder if zombies think people are ugly'.  I would have loved it if this game was 3D, but you get what you pay for - and this game is a bit dated.  My only real complaint is that the shooting can sometimes be a bit off, with the aiming being a bit jerky in places.  Nonetheless, it's a fun game. If you don't mind helicpter flying games which are a bit old, then I recommend that you get this one.",1

"I don't usually write about my game purchases, but Endless Legend really impressed me; from the mechanics of gameplay to the great fantasy story, I was completely taken in and found myself loosing hours in the world of Auriga. I had bought this at the same time as Civ. Beond Earth and endend up barely touching BE. I know I am only a little over 12 hrs in, but with all the other games on sale, it's been hard to dedicate my time solely to EL. Now, with Christmas time off, I will be spending a much more developing my new race and expanding their civilization to far reaches of Auriga. Must have purchase, if you like 4x games!!",1
"This game is a travesty. Shallow, poorly supported, painfully boring. No actual roleplaying or anything to engage you in the game. A blot on an otherwise good license. Avoid like the plague.",-1
"This game is GREAT, but it is not without its flaws.  +Without counting aesthetic stuff, absolutely everything in this game can be acquired without spending a single penny. Yes you have to grind for it, but it is not unfairly grindy. It's tedious and if you have super bad luck frustrating I guess, but it is doable. You can buy guns and warframes for money, but what matters here are the mods you put in them so it doesnt really matter. If you are of those that call something p2w if you can buy gameplay related stuff, then you'd say this is it too, but it really isn't.  +Game is addictive. Maybe I just have an addictive nature, but I swear it's one of those 'I'll just do one more mission' and suddenly 12 hours have passed. Gameplay is smooth and good, too. The parkour is awesome once you learn how to use it naturally.  +Visuals are ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. Not sure if the store page got updated with the newest update, but they amped up the visuals and they look gorgeous.   +/- I really like where theyre going with the story, but right now it is too cryptic and assumption based. Would like to see them flesh it out a bit. Granted, they're doing that right now with the newest cinematic quest The War Within, but that kinda raised more questions than it answered.  +/- Music is meh. Some music is cool like the ones from cinematic quests, but it's mostly forgetable.  +/- AI is not super good. Not that it needs to be, right? But, you may sometimes feel that you're just mowing through mindless hordes of enemies.  - Balance. This isn't a PVP focused game (although there is PVP in the game), so bad balance isn't terribly gamebreaking, but it is palpable how some guns are trash tier while others are god. DE tried to fix this with the new patch, although I'm not going to say how because spoilers, but it wasn't very good. The system is still new and theyre looking to improve the system a bit more. They do seem to be going in the right direction, but only time will see. As of now, even though there's not a single meta build, there are things that you just shouldn't waste your time on.  - Not very understandable at first. This game has many game mechanics that, for some godly reason, DE didn't bother to explain how they work in-game. If you follow their streams or forums, you might kinds understand how they work. But if you're just entering the game, good ♥♥♥♥ing luck. Luckily, the community is fairly friendly and you'll definitely find someone who can explain the more complex things to you, but it is definitely not noob friendly.  All in all, I definitely recommend this game, but remember that this is like an MMO. You'll have to grind a ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff and wait a lot as well to get the guns or whatever you grinded for. Not that this is bad, as it encourages gameplay, but I can see why this would be a turn off for some people.  ",1

"Ok, i was going to write this after completing the game and all of its DLC, but with all the people down voting it just for technical issues (however they are justifiable) isnt right. Let me start off by saying ive beating this game on the PS4 and while it was an ok experience, i just feel more at home on a PC. Id also like to note that i did NOT pay full price. I payed $23 for the base game and season pass content.  As many of you know and ♥♥♥♥♥ about, no this game is not optimized for crap, has frame issues, and wont let you turn off certain gameworks features. i only have issues in the batmobile, when gliding or running around its usually between 50-60fps with everything at max 1080p but enough of the performance issues lets talk about the GAMEPLAY...  the main story is honestly short compared to arkham city, but the wealth of side missions and dlc missions will keep you more than entertained for hours on end.My bigest problem is actually the batmobile, it feels like they wanted it to be something more than what it was, and to me it just doesnt measure up. I find myself graple gliding more than actually using the car.   i wont spoil the ending but it was painfully obvious and dissapointing as a long time reader of the comics. I hate the way it ends and cant stand what they did to scarecrow or a certain robin at the end. That being said i still thouroughly enjoy this game, it works decent enough and ive had no crashes as of yet, id say its a bigger challenge getting older games to run than this.",1

"This game. This game is in a nutshell a puzzle. Its no ordinary puzzle though. If you plan to buy this game, DONT look up how to play it. Trust me, it will ruin the experience.

"Really good game. I spent a lot of time playing it, buuuuuutis a F2P-P2W",-1
"This game truly does blow your mind away. This game has got to a point where it is so good you just cant stop playng it. The playerbase isnt as big as it used to be but it is still an amazing experiance at high player times like in the evenings. Its so fun to play a battle with 200+ people in and just stop and stand back in the chaos of it. Just seeing tanks roll down the hills whilst fighter planes battle it out in the skies and the black dots of people getting closer and closer. This game couldnt be recommended more and since its free i can definately say go ahead and get it, you wont be loosing out on much even in the firest 70 hours.  the negatives? you cant customise your character in the way he looks without buying it but thats only a small issue. my main problem is that this game doesnt come on steam fully like EVE so i can just buy it their and not have to log on to their website.  overall - get the GAME",1
"What you will get : - Old school rpg with an anime flavour, a nice storyline and very entertaining dialogs ! - Maid in disguises - Healing rain of roses - Eloquent troubadour !

"TL;DR: Score 8/10 overall. For more detailed review, look below.     Dragon's Dogma  is one of my favorite games of all time.     From the music to the pawns this game is fantastic and is still fantastic from the time that i spent playing it on the 360. I will be going into more details about the game as this review goes on but for now allow me to tell you a tiny summery of the games story. I will try to avoid spoilers.    The Beginning of a Legend. -A Short Summery-",1
"This game has bad controls, annoying music, literally one sound in the entire game, kiddish graphics and bad level designs ranging from boring easy to unfair hard. The only thing I liked about this game is the dead face of the protagonist, shamefully got that badge for that occasion.",-1
A game in a dystopian future where your every move is monitered hats off to the creator for the plot twist at the end. now that it is fully released it's a must play.,1
prepare yourself for the world's most tedious and least straight forward final boss fight the rest of the game is good,1
"It fluctuates quite a bit from the original Bioshock's feel. I got very worried when I heard you could only carry two guns at a time, but once I played the game a bit longer I realized Irrational had pulled it off in a way that doesn't make you feel limited, but instead makes you think about what you are taking into battle with you. Do you take the carbine and hand cannon, or the volley gun and rpg? The average game has you picking two: story, gameplay or graphics/technical prowess, so when something like BSI comes along with all three, you know it's special. Bioshock Infinite shows developers like Activision or EA how far you can fluctuate from the formula of past games in a series, and how mind-blowingly good it can be. I do have two gripes though. There is no map, which makes backtracking on the optional objectives a bit difficult, and the ending feels like Ken Levine made a masterpiece, but didn't know how to finish it. Overall, it will probably be my GOTY, and is one of the best games I've played in a long time.",1
"Well... This is one of the best games from 2016, until now. I know you cant please everybody... But it is strange see some people writing extensive negative analysis about Inside. Their lifes must be so awesome that this experience shouldnt affect them. Therefore, they shouldn't have time to talk about the things they 'think' that is bad for this game so why bother? I am confused. Must be a boring existence.",1
"It's a good game, but unfortunately feels buggy and unfinished. I would say it's worth buying for a big civ fan, but everyone else should wait for future patches before spending the money.",-1
"Overview:  A game where there is little consequence for ruthlessly pushing your friend into a saw blade. Play with yourself... I mean play by yourself or play with a friend and make it through a fantastic collection of obstacle courses- punching the occasional cat. If you don't laugh at least once through game play... you're probably not doing it right.  Pros: 1. Stamper is the narrator - nuff said. 2. If you die you don't have to start over; checkpoints through out the level. 3. A good selection/combination of 'weapons' to help you and/or your partner make it through the map. 4. In game voice communication. 5. 0 pay to win options. 6. Low requirements. 7. Great controls... I've never loved double jump so much since Mario. 8. Beautiful/simple graphics. 9. Fun character customization earned through playing the game. 10. Humor +++ through the entire game. 11. Inexpensive- you would expect such a great game to cost your first born child. (Can buy it for like $5-10 online) 12. Has one of the greatest game trailers ever produced. 13. Your great grandfather who never approves... would approve of this game. 14. I literally can not say enough good things about this game.  Cons:  1. You haven't played it yet! Hurry up and buy it already. 2. May cause fits of laughter leading to a headache.  End Note: Seriously, you don't need this comment to convince you, just go watch the Steam trailer for BattleBlock Theater. When you do go and see it for the first time, make sure you're not drinking anything. Why you ask? Go ahead and drink something while watching it, I dare you.",1

how can you play this,-1
"I have to be fair about this game. So I try to play it simple. It is a dating sim or visual novel, whatever term you prefer. It isn't exactly bad - but it also isn't quite good either.   The story in short, you and your girlfriend break up at the start of a three month semester break. Your father is upset about you being a slothful , negligent and superficial way of life (what also was the reason your girlfriend was using to coerce you). So he puts you into his car and drives you to your uncle, who is a rural farmer. You have to cope with this, and your uncle ... you might fight against those things and befriend other girls, or you see that your dad, uncle and girlfriend might be right and develop some reason.  One of the things on visual novels is, that everything is about decissions and making it work out fine - in that way they are related to adventures of the type choose your own adventures - but this game has also a little twist. Your uncle is farmer, but his produce is restricted to fruits and vegetables and he's expecting you to also do some farmwork by giving your own plot of land a bountiful harvest (yeah, whatever) ... So you have to weed them, plant seeds and remove pests, water and in the end harvest them ... did I say that you also can muck your plants?  In reality this is truly backbreaking work, and you'll have to have a lot of patience over a long period of time (salads don't grow to harvestable size in three to five days) but you have to make concessions to get the game going. The money of your harvest goes into your own budget and this budget is used up to shop new seeds - you'll see where this is going? Yeah, at the end you'll have money for the things you farmed ... Fast growing plants guarantee a constant but low input in money, slow growing plants will cause a good earn in money (  blackberries being the most expensive  )...  *sigh* In the end, your semester break comes to an end and you have accomplished: Nothing. Well you might have grown aquainted to one of the girls, worsened the relations to others and of course ... your family or the opposite of all this and grown a pro (hahahahaha) fruit and vegetable farmer with a lot of bucks at your own disposal.  And this is the thing with dating sims that do give me the creeps most of the time - on a pure fantastical setting all is fine and you can say, well this game at least doesn't give the pretension of being a sim - it is a story being told in which you are the protagonist and decide what is happening (I love the endless dungeon series from TSR back in the 70s and 80s, I also love Steve Jacksons and Ian Livingstones Fighting Fantasies) - but in a modern world setting a lot is going amiss, trying to be realistic doesn't help (hey it's a fricking dating sim) and too much fantasies also won't work (doh, look at those horsies *sigh*)   I grew up in a rural setting and to tell you the truth, this game has a far to simplicistic world view about a lot of things, but you have to start somewhere - this game got a E grade from me. Sure, it isn't all bad, but it also isn't all well and it has lost a lot of things - especially the 'spoiled adolescent' role of the protagonist is a very painful stereotype.  I can't recomend this game, based on the gaming experience.",-1
"I don't like tower defense, but I love this. The precision and attention to detail in the levels is amazing throughout, and the inventiveness and sheer difficulty of the challenge modes is wonderful. Completing a level is one thing, but perfecting your strategy and getting a gold medal is something different entirely. Great variety of towers and aliens, and a huge amount of content. There's easily 100+ hours gameplay in this with all the DLC and achievements. Also GLaDOS is awesome, as per usual.",1

"Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This recent entry in the Deus Ex franchise is a rare gem as not many games have amazing gameplay mixed with an epic story of espionage and conspiracy. Many recent games have mostly been repitition shooters COUGH COUGH Calll Of Duty, however this games stylistic cyberpunk story and gameplay prove that great story and gameplay is not lost in AAA games.  Let's just hope that it's sequel, Mankind Divided (or as Jim Sterling would say, Content divided!) Won't have it's story and/or ruined",1
"I can't really put into words how I feel about this game other than its more of an experience than a game, which is not a bad thing whatsoever.   I purchased back in early to mid may on a rainy Sunday, reading reviews on how spectacular the story line is.   It was 15 bucks or so and on sale, so I decided to take the plunge.   I immediately played through the game in one sitting and teared up in several spots. Be warned, if you have a weak heart do not play because this game immediately starts off heavy and gets even more heavy at the end.   One of the few games that kinda left me speechless at the end.   Thanks for reading.   -One  ",1

Seriously, who has such a cry for help profile?   Second time through, I called everyone a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a tool and gave myself the screennamme 'ToolbagAss'. The game was much more fun.   It's good. I'd love to see an update with more story branches. I'd pay for it. Thank you!",1
"Dragon AGe Origins is on eof the best RPGs to date. This is the first addition to a line made by Bioware. The combat in this game is like many older style rpgs, where you may pause combat and utilize skills of your various party members in a more strategic manner. Paarty members you meet have a very interesting back-story and develop as you move along with the main story line. These individuals are people you might learn to care for, and choose their ultimate fate. Graphically the game is a bit dated, but you will find that it does not really matter becaue the story more than makes up for it. You start off the game with a unique story based on the different race you choose. After that, it is all about ending a big blight that curses humanity and all others involved. I give this game a 94/100, because it has an exceptional story-line with amazing characters and awesome gameplay.",1
"There’s a running duality to all of Siter’s games. KAMUI asks you to dance between twin layers while RefleX has you constantly switch between offense and defence to reflect projectiles back at your enemy. ALLTYNEX’s catch is figuring out whether you’re going to play safe and shoot down things from the edge of the screen or charge in swinging. Be brave, be good or be lucky and boss fights can last seconds as you position yourself in a manufactured safe-spot right in front of their face and hack away. There’s something so satisfying about watching an enemy fighter craft quadruple in size by firing robotic tentacles that latch massive frigates to its sides only to then get effortlessly slashed into scrap regardless. In finding yourself trapped in a corner and realising you can just slice the smaller bullets out of the air and squeeze through the projectile wall unscathed.

Unique and odly charming. Its a short game about being a lil fly. I think the guys and gals at Krillibite are making some really good and unique stuff.    Its worth looking into and trying out.  ,1

Great co-op game. Easy to pick up and play and put down for quick instant action.,1

"The only thing you get from the game is FUN FUN FUN &amp; FUN! I only get problems with the keyboard control, but when i plugged my razer sabertooth, BAM!! Works like a magic, Really recommended for those who love racing game such as mario kart, nascar rumble, and CTR racing. The Graphic's so smooth that i'm loving every second of it. And beware for genuine controller user, u'd get vibration everywhere in your hands xD Really recommended game, and the AI are way too challenging, you won't get to the finish line easily even in medium level. Many of my wins were pure luck in a pinch. Oh and the thing i love most so far, that the racing game offers you obstacles and changing area every lap, u wontget only to race on land for laps, but you'd boat across the sea, fly evading meteors, and many more!

This game is extremely dated. The models and shading are very primitive and the music is horrid. This would be agood game for less powerful computers but on a modern games PC it really sucks.,-1
"I've been advised I played this game about 84 hours and that's wrong because I know I've played this game at least 10 times that many hours. This is the best of the UT series and it simply is the best multiplayer full on FPS action that's not gargled and then dilluted with junk and made into some sort of rule infested perversion of a elemental FPS game. This game rawkz and if there'a any multiplayer left online then try it because for years this was, 'IT.' A very fun game with very stable online multiplayer capability. The graphics are kewl and don't require immense amounts of power and everything about the game is fantasy but that' what *Unreal is about ;) Love the game.",1
The only game I had on my I-pad back then... 10/10,1
"Long Live the Queen is a RPG on rails, stripped of almost everything but the character sheet. All events are scripted and will play out the same way on each play though. Your 'choices' can take you down a slightly different path where skill checks will vary.  The challenge in this game is in documenting the various skill checks that come up as a result of the choice tree. Once you know what skills you need for a certain ending you just need to replay the game to get your skills up to the minimum level to pass the various checks.  The anime style art work didn't help the game, but a least it was consistent. But if you like seeing a cartoon 15 year old girl who is drawn like she's 12, and acts like shes 10, dress up in skimpy outfits, this game might be for you.  TL;DR: RPG with only the character sheet; get your perv on.",-1
"Amazingly rich world with tons of interesting stories. Highly recommended, main game and blood and wine are amazing. I thought hearts of stone was okay. But amazing game with amazing characters. The pinnacle of role playing games.",1

very addicting,1
"I was going into the game with mixed expectations, but these where completely washed away and replaced with utter amazement. All changes and improvements are clearly distinct and making for a way different experience.   I'm officially addicted.",1
"I absolutely recommend. It runs really well on my 280X - didn't experience any frame issues at all. The story is absolutely brilliant and the ending left me sitting in my chair for half an hour comprehending what just happened. If it is on sale, I definitely recommend grabbing it - instant classic!",1
Nice game! :),1

So Far I enjoy this game alot more than D3. Very fun. The gem system is very interesting.,1
"Killing Floor is one of those games that never gets old no matter how many times you play it. It's addicting, tense (espiscelly with the Hell on Earth difficulty), action-packed, pretty good FPS, and you gotta love that terrible yet tolerable voice acting. The only downside is the amount of servers there is anymore. In 2011-2015 there would be up to 200 servers, but now all I can get is 20 at the highest, shame to see such a great game lose its playerbase in that amount of time, but I digress. So basically, buy the game now before everyone's gone.",1

No explination needed because its huniepop...  10/10 Would bang odd women again....,1
Great Game!,1
Its a good game but what would make it better is a server where you cant do any damage to other players because sometimes people just want to have fun but other people join servers on purpose to kill other players and that ruins the fun,1
"I got bored and uninstalled it half way thru the game. I dont think its as 'terrible' as some people say it is, but is definitely NOT good either. And for the price? is not worth it.  ",-1
Ready your breakfast hearty....,1
I haven't put much time into this game as of yet. But so far it it fun. It's great actually but not vanilla. The problems are it is capped at 30 fps and that alone is bad. Don't worry there are fixes so that's good. I recommend if you do buy and play this game you have a controller handy.,1
Great platformer.,1
"A simple but effective tool, with a strong and passionate community supporting it. Easy for anyone to pick up and learn, yet capable enough to allow for some truly marvelous creations.",1

"LoveBeat is a free rhythm dance game made by Korean studio CrazyDiamond. I haven't originally expected to play it myself, but after I've seen that my girlfriend has got more than 70 hours played on that, I had to try it, I had to find what's so great about it.  The gameplay is nothing unexpected for the genre, as you use arrows and space key to match the beat. Though I have felt that sometime it was more like making your own beats next to a song, after all you won't mind that much as you'll just focus on the keys you have to press. You'll be most probably also focusing on the current leaderboards, because you are never dancing alone! For every song, people will join your room to compete with you.  But that doesn't mean you would have to play just something like 'classic dancematch', there are other modes and from those are worth mentioning the team ones. You can unite into teams, to get shared points for matching the beats.  That isn't all, the game will motivate you to find a person that will get bound to you. You can get into a relationship with a totally unknown person! Also, there are families; MMORPG players may think of it as of guilds. All this social activity may sound boring and unoriginal, but since LoveBeat has really friendly community (don't expect people shouting at you for being a newbie), there is a quite high chance that you'll get your first kisses and relationships soon.  While the soundtrack is considered being Korean pop, it mostly isn't the bland one you might think of. There is a good distribution among pop, electronic and dance music. Just a sad thing is, many people like to play the same songs over and over; you might get annoyed by hearing some songs often, even though the game has a big playlist.  It's a free to play game, so where's the catch? Your real money can be used to get faster experience gain (but levels aren't important there, it's not an RPG) and to get more unique costumes for your dancer. The most important thing I want to say is that all songs are available for free, so you can play through the content as you like!  To mention some flaws that you'll see, there are texts that would deserve (probably another) proofread. Also, the game feels overall old, as it's running on low resolution, and it has confusing menu options for new players (with mailbox and gift system that feels like early 2000). It just takes some time to understand all things you can do in game outside of the dance pool.   Conclusion:",1
"the game is really fun if you have friends to play with, playing with randoms can be a bit frustrating, if you're playing solo you'll probably want to be playing as the monster, as this is a team heavy game and one bad member on your team can cause you to lose.",1

We will never see a KoA Online.  Let me start with the bad. The difficulty? Too easy. The DLC was letting players pay to effetively add power (at least the preorder DLC I had). I never understand why players want to effectively pay money to use cheat codes. And how developers started deciding that that would even work. But it is common now. The story? Mediocre... oh the world is wonderful but the story... well it is not quite top tier.  The good. The combat is fun. The character customization feels nice. The world (yeah I keep saying that). It could have made a great MMO but we will never know.  The devs just spent too much money, took on too much debt. I still recommend this game when you see it go on sale. But just remember that the team is gone. Don't expect an expansion, more DLC, or even more patches. I feel that $30 is a bit steep but at half off I can definitely say give it a try.",1
"Hard to stop playing it. It's hard to imagine how many hours I might put into that game only to one day be Sir Taco the XVII, only to end up laughing every time he farts.",1
  Dead by Daylight is a very tactical game that great to play with friends or solo. It makes you take decision that would make for a wining end or a horrible dead. The question you should ask your self ones you start is ' Are you willing to risk your self for the sake of another surviver?' -You will feel the pain of every decision you make...,1
Still one of the best games out to date.,1
The love child of Shinobi and Deus Ex. Best downloadable title for 2012 and one of the all time stealth greats.,1
"This game seems so incredibly simple but for such a simple game it's insanely fun, the way I found this game was my friend had it on his wishlist so I checked out. I thought $21 was pretty affordable so I decided to give it a try. I've had this game since yesterday morning and I've already put 12.5 hours into it. The graphics are great, car designs are comical yet accurate, the tutorial is easy to understand, different gamemodes including season mode, offline free play, online, and exhibiton, and it doesn't matter whether or not your offline or online the game is fun to play either way! I would easily give this game a thumbs up and reccomendation!  PROS: -Great graphics -Fun to play -Simple -Online -Mainly friendly environment -Etc....  CONS: -Bots can be idiotic and carry the ball right into your net -Have to have wifi router nearby or in a good spot or will be incredibly laggy  That's all, overall a phenomenal game! Well, done!  9.5/10",1
"Update: 22/8/16 - Still crap, and crashes. Also to play and win people say rush buy factories 1 turn after another and turn out colony ships is the only way to survive in close up games. The power chart is still rubbish and on normal the AI cheats.   Terrible game at least 20 different games and no win and that on the starting galaxy size, my custom toon.  The opposition get too strong too fast. Within 30 odd moves I have 160 ships at my doorstep trying to kill me.  Game crashes almost every 20 turns, it is so annoying.  Noticed that the best way to win is to specialise in just one set of offensive and defensive tech. Choose missiles and armour, nothing else. Also when you custom your toon, choose the options where you have defenders on your planets and you dont use farms, insteadyou build assembly for population. Dont bother upgrading starbases, the bare basic mining is fine. Use ships to defend your space as required. Never upgrade a ship, decommission and get money and build the better versions. Set aside entire planets for wealth and reasearch. Home world is best maximised for production/research nothing else. Once you start getting extra planets try to move as much research off the home world so it can pump out new ships insanely fast. When you start the game you will be tempted to put everything into construction, dont. set variables to 50/50 manufacturing/research on home world and pump out colony ship/constructors at a steady pace. The research is required at the start. Try to even out your tech development for the planets, no point having too many developments in one path if you are building upgrades and get missiles and armour as deep as you can. Also get money ASAP, choose global economy faction when you can and get markets asap.   Played the game on insanely large map, full list of opponents at adept AI. Customised my toon, so essentially everyone hates him, maximised prettymuch all the good stuff. And easily won the game very quickly. Just expand, expand, expand.",-1
"running windows 10 game won't even start, spent hours looking at work arounds, patches , etc.. nothing works",-1
one of my favourite games!,1
"Elsa's animation... I   CAME   consistently for 2 months. My hours may not reflect these 2 months, but it's because I played the game offline ;)",1
Virtual pet rock that says nice things. Mountain is good. Mountain is nice.,1
Good story and awkward platformer. 6/10.,1
"Pro:  Love the atmosphere Kinda relaxing Warband system and stuff is interesting i like to have a formation and make it better  Con:  Other team die, cant pick their loot even if its on the ground at your feet and your cart is 10 feet away? i mean seriously... Are they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or what.  It make me feel i do this hard fight only for crumb of bread when the whole bread is lying there at my feet but i cant reach it.  If reccomend this game if you can get someone to buy it for you, if not keep your money until they change something ( if they ever do)",-1
"The game is fun and it is a different take on rogue likes with its art style and gameplay all related to shooting things. It is however unforgiving with damage and poor play due to the drop rates being on the lower end of random. Being a bullet hell game, the key to survival is learning patterns and timings of the foes you face. And then dodge rolling out of the way.  Like all rogue likes, the game is mostly rng based and a run can be pretty much over by the end of the first floor if things did not roll in your favor. Most of the items you pick up is more guns and passive items are usually hp. If you do not get a better gun in your chests or shops, then fighting the boss will be a chore as you plink away with the starting weapon even if it is doable. Which is different from other games like Binding of Issac, you do not build up much stats to progress, you pray for a gun that mulches bosses or clear rooms. The game quickly becomes finding that one good gun.",1
0/10 cant click on birds,1
This game is so damn amazing. I could play it all day.,1
"I Have Started Playing This Game And Its Absolutely Amazing! There Is A Fun Multiplayer Gameplay For All Ages And A Challange To Beat It At The Same Time! I Suggest This Game To Most People, Even The Ones Who Dident Like The Games Like 'Terraria' Cause This Is Diffrient!",1
medium game for the excelent in 1st person mode player...overall it is badass,1
"Lots of bad reviews for this game. Honestly I don't really feel anything towards it. Civ games always feel like drugs to me. Once I start I just can't stop. The max amount of rounds should be like 2000 or something. Still, doesn't matter cause the AI always destroys me at round 180+ kek :')   Tl;dr: I like it it's not that bad",1
its good,1
COOL! play it with friends Kill each other :D why not right?,1
Best Call of Duty Modern Warfare Game EVER!,1
It is more challenging than PAYDAY 2 and has better UPGRADES 'tree'. I played it 21hours and ill play it again and again its extrimely fun - shooting civilians and cops at the momment :DD,1
"didnt enjoy this on pc, controls were awful and felt like it should it should have been left on the ps2. wouldnt but again",-1
Woah...what did I step into? ,-1
"  PROS: -Really good game mechanics with ghost and Selma -Sometimes really 'demandeing' and difficult -Nice puzzles -Nice story -Quite interesting graphic style -Awesome music  CONS: -It's too short definitely -Controlling system sometimes does strange things -Story is good, but isn't explained well; would be nice to see some dialogues -There was one riddle in mine where you had to turn buttons in good order. Couldn't understand what's going on there and passed it by pushing random. Other puzzles were better and still demanding and fun  Beside those features, it was really fun game and enjoyed it.    ",1
"A fantastically made Medeival RTS game. Not a very good tutorial, but easy to pick up on after a couple days. Would recommend to anybody in favor of browser based strategy games. Build your own castle, battle with a House of factions, live as a peaceful trader, the game has hundreds of ways to play, and you control it all. From setting taxes to governing a province, this game has anything you can think of as a ruler.",1
It's like Killing Floor with armour   I WANT ARMOUR,1
"Fun, Easy, and fast action",1
The best Tower Defense game I've played.,1
Best RTS I ever played.,1
It's like Civ 5 vanilla with worse mechanics. Only thing improved is spying.  It'll be great once a DLC or two is out but right now it feels like an unfinished product. Cannot recommend in its current form.,-1
Controls are very bad and camera angle make me crazy time to time. Could be better if more optimized for pc.,-1
"Your character has 3 modes: -School clothes mode, the standard balanced mode. -Shinobi mode, you clothes change you get a little stronger but you'll heal your hp -Frantic mode, you stay on your underwear, get strong as ♥♥♥♥ but your def will lower.  You can only imagine which of them is the best.",1
"This is a classic game the prime of pc rpg gaming. Really wish they end up remaking this as a bioshock infinite dlc or a whole new game in general. Only problem is playing online requires a exchanging ips, making it harder to find good matches.",1
1 Hour of my ( Time Played ) was  Spent  in the   Queue!   10/10 Will Queue Again!     Pros:,1
Buy this game or Derek will kill you like he killed Jimi and Kurt Cobain and everyone else.,1
If you have a life then this game might get in the way...   ....but get it   ....seriously it's sick,1
"great game, highly addictive and... fun. 25 hours before I could beat the game... easy mode. :)",1
10/10 Would insert soul again!,1
I realize my time on record for steam is going to be very low. I platinumed it on Ps4 and played through multiple times on Xbox one. Truly one of the greatest gaming experiences I have ever had and I've been gaming almost 25 years.   -Combat- The combat can be a little wonky but over all it is not as bad as people say. The problem is they treat it like a hack and slash. It is not a hack and slash. Think of it of more a reality check. You wouldnt just rush blindly in and swing wildly if a bear was charging. You would wait for an opening. i dont think many people do this.  -Graphics- Amazing. I thought they looked good on PS4 but on my PC i nerdgasm everytime I open it up.\  -Story- No spoilers but a very strong story. All around. Just make good choices. Do not get greedy romance wise and the best ending is easily obtainable.  TL;DR 10/10 buy it.  ,1
"Cannot recommend this game enough! It's like a perfect mix between the Civ series and an RPG. Every unit, i will repeat, EVERY UNIT can be completely customized down to their faces and eyes. The point of most of the matches is to go down the tech ladder to get more advanced weapons, and armor; even horses and wargs for your armies. Add to that the fact that the faction leaders are mostly heroes that you have created, and the deep, deep (sounding) lore the game has, and you will be playing it for years to come.",1
"Non stopping action from the beginning to the end. Superb graphics and audio, as well as a cool engaging story. In my opinion a must have play for those who love fps and a gigantic step up from the bag of absolute mediocrity that is the call of duty franchise",1
This game is beauty at it's full potential,1
"Hi   My concerns seem to be falling on deaf ears,not even a reply.I say again,that I HAVE NOT received my SP2 update through STEAM.I am assuming this is DTG's fault,cannot believe it is STEAM.It has been available on the developers sight for weeks now.WHEN are we to receive it through STEAM. I would be grateful if someone can reply this time Thanks",-1
"My Career players are all invisible now lol, I can only see the basketball......... 2K16 really need a fix for this problem as soon as possible....... Anybody agree with me?",1
You play as a space bounty hunter gone rogue from the government. ♥♥♥♥ goes down after trying to kill your old commanding officer on an abondoned planet.   -Awesome humor -Great point system rewarding you for killing people creatively -Good story and characters that have great personalities  10/10,1
Great game.................. PogChamp,1
"This is game has ceaser legion in it so decided the write a review about the salad that gives it name to it  Ingredients  1 medium ciabatta loaf (or 4 thick slices crusty white bread) 3 tbsp olive oil 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 1 large cos or romaine lettuce, leaves separated  For the dressing  1 garlic clove 2 anchovies from a tin medium block parmesan or Grano Padano cheese for grating and shaving (you won't use it all) 5 tbsp mayonnaise 1 tbsp white wine vinegar    Method  1.Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Tear the bread into big, ragged croutons or, if you prefer, cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2 tbsp olive oil. Rub the oil into the bread and season with a little salt if you like (sea salt crystals are best for this). Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly.    2.Rub chicken breasts with remaining oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan (it will sizzle if it’s hot enough) and leave for 4 mins. Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear.   3.Bash the garlic with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash the anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl. Grate a handful of cheese and mix with the rest of the dressing ingredients. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it.   4.Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons. Add most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the Parmesan on top and serve straight away ",1
"Its good, 2K austrailia is dead, so more DLC is not happening but still.",1
"Interesting ending, makes me want to play The New Order again now haha, but seriously this game was good. I would buy it on sale though unless your a die-hard Wolfenstein player.",1
"loved it, way better functionally than the first one.",1
When will they release AdVenture Socialist ?,1
"Final Fantasy VII, stands its ground to this day as one of the best JRPG's, at the time it was innovative with its design, combat and overall changes. It was definitely one of the stand out moments in the franchise and is a landmark in the gaming continuity. To this day Final Fantasy remains one of my favorite games of all time and this remake was a great rendition and keeps its legacy alive. Its up there with Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 3 and Onimusha 4 as a definitive title for the PlayStation 1 and PC formats. I recommend to anyone who hasn't played this game yet to purchase this fine piece of art, it is a must have for any video game collection.",1
Its so funny and i need a review for the badage stuff thing,1
This is one of the most weird and original games I've ever played. And Its super fun when you have some friends to play with. But that doesnt mean you cannot enjoy game just by yourself or with random people :). Ofc I should not forget about workshop where you can get new hats for your duck and many many cool maps!,1
Amazing game that I finished in 5.4 hours. Good if you have little spare time to play games!,1
"I've been playing this game in beta for over two years now, and the game has gone through drastic changes quite a few times, but the game finally feels right. There's a wide world to explore and a lot of new story content to take part in along with epic instanced missions with friends and even more epic raids. The combat of the game is kind of like Tribes crossed with borderlands, The story is surpisingly interesting and deep, There's tons of things to do and lot's more on the way. Bet of all, unlike most free to play MMO's, there are no pay to win schemes in this game. Give it a shot afterall it's free!",1
"didn't know what i would have gotten myself into (this game was free to play for a limited time) i tried it and immediatly got hooked, now im up at 4 in the morning writing a review after playing the game for what felt like forever.",1
vury gud woold mile heigh club/10,1
This is like your normal LEGO movie game. If you like those games you'll love this one. It's like the rest but the 'free play' portions is huge. You'll put a lot of hours in trying to get 100%.,1
"awesome game, not worth 14eur ofc but you can get it cheaper if you look for it  good brineless massacure ^^",1
Don't Starve + Friends = Learner + Veteran + Tag-along  Recipe for disaster indeed... but you have fun and that's what matters!,1
"Do not buy this game, it won't even launch after installation... Steam support is no help as the steps they suggest brings up more errors. Do not buy this!",-1
"This game has adventure, like every Call of Duty. The maps and the players almost look like real-life... This game magically gives you the feeling of the war like any other game in the world. Like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, in my opinion, those are the two best-selling games in history of Call of Duty with amazing fields, where either you are a cliffhanger, or you are the mafia... I highly recommend you to buy this game...   PS: I'm not expert in English. Buy it now :DD",1
"Lucky for me I bought a bundle of DMC3 and DMC4 with 75% off. Terrible port with outdated controller support. I bought a controller specially for it and couldn't set it up either. So don't waste 23$, better buy DMC4 and enjoy a good slasher.",-1
Not enough cowbell.,-1
"Major Edit:  Take this from a guy who's played it for more than an hour or five.   This game is easy (Though no walk in the park), simple, repetitive and very hard to get into at first. The constant lag spikes, the annoying frequent speech patterns of the pirates, the constant cleaning of crap, INSANELY constant feeding and paying your crew, hell this game was a little hard for me to digest for a while. But I stuck it out.  I found quickly, that while the game was annoying in some areas, it actually held a lot of promise. The BGM was fun to listen to, never once had to turn down my volume (Despite some other reviews said), and I actually liked the ship battles. Sure, the enemy didn't start boarding your ship until later levels and your crew constantly stood around dying or killing themselves somehow, but I felt rewarded whenever I slaughtered them (Or died trying) to the very end and reaped my reward. It was satisfactory, to me.  I was expecting (And will hopefully see it in Pixel Privateers) to see sea monsters, sirens, ginormous whales and other of those awesome pirate things that one would normally expect to see in a pirate game. Yet none of which were shown (Though the brief glimpse of the sharks were annoying rather because you couldn't fight (Or fish for) them). I'd still say this game was crap because of this.  But.  I actually stuck through it all, and not once did my complaints come to thought. I enjoyed the game, laughed at some of my own stupid (Gruesome) deaths and I only frowned whenever my game would crash (RARELY). The pixelated format of the game was fun, the controls were EASY to learn despite other reviews saying otherwise, the UI was alright AND you can turn off bloom (Which is a great way to reduce lag). The witty shanties that the pirates sang onboard or in the bars were fun to listen to, the interesting conversations that would go on ('I knew a pirate like you' 'I got a jar of dirt!') and of course my all time favorite Pixel Pirate moments... flag and ship editing. I loved the hell out of both of those things, never have I ever been able to design a ship that would sail (No, not even in Sid Meyer's Pirates was I able to do this (Even though it is an older game)). And my flag (Which was usually a Terraria reference) was fun. Yeah, I disliked the limited color choices, and the small space for the drawing board, but it was still creative.  Really. I hated a lot about this game, but I loved it all the same.  So, for all of the liked and disliked features of the game... I'd still have tor reccomend it, hell screw if it's on sail or not. Try the game out for yourself, I did and I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I'd be.  In fairness.  I'd give this game a solid 7/10.  (I wonder if they'll add multiplayer in Pixel Privateers?)",1
"Nice, it works perfectly in multi!",1
"The storyline is too dull, but the game is the best RPG combat I've played. Very addictive.",1
Buy it. Play it. Love it.,1
"Love the game, full of tactics but at the same time free flowing. So much fun!",1
One of the best games in my library even it is a little short.,1
This might sound weird but being RPG lover I missed this legendary game somehow at the time of the release:D Now I decided to give it a go just to get acquanted with The Witcher universe before starting Wild Hunt which was a huge success in 2015. Even now that the game is old it is still great to play the atmosphere here is amazing as well as the music! Can't believe I missed it:D  10/10,1
"Very enjoyable metroidvania with a great atmosphere and good amount of adventure gameplay too. I love that it's not all combat.   on the criticle side, puzzles are mostly logical but occasionally you kind of do something for no reason that works in your favor.  the interaction controls for a controller are weird and the aiming is more annoying than it should be. but those are mostly nitpicky things from an outstanding experience.",1
"Very fun game. I used to play it on my iPhone, now I got it on steam and I is a lot better and easier.",1
"Take every competitive game you love into a blender, mix them up, inject some roids and you have Battleborn...",1
fun game for friends or even on your own,1
Can't get it to work on a 64Bit system,-1
"This is a narrative from the first person perspective, and I found it enjoyable. Was I moved? Yea, slightly, but enough that I found the experience memorable. it's a big house you're wandering around in, and it's sometimes a little creepy being alone for so long.   Either way, I recommend the game. It's short enough that a bad recommendation won't burn you for long.",1
That was fast.  I swear that's never happened before.,1
"A nice, original story with cute pixel graphics. The perfect indie game.  Good luck trying to get the best ending however!  10/10",1
"Please my friends wait for 1 year or so before purchasing this game. Like its predecessor 'empire: total war' it has terrible bugs and designing flaws. There are many reviews about it you may find them, Even RTS lover and fan of this franchise like me is discouraging it. Please wait until it is more playeable.",-1
highly rcomend this game. It is fun by yourself and with friends.,1
bad game you batter play all is dust,1
"Of course if you don't already know. This game is fantastically well done. It's a fun puzzle based story, in which you are the puzzle piece and the portals are your tools.  It's a bit short but makes up for it in quality. The only minor flaw is the load time (which to be fair is probably fast for the time it was released) but I am not someone who has a big issue with waiting to play an amazing game.   This is a testament to how games should be developed - thoughtfully, carefully, creatively, and with joy. I gotta commend Valve for this gem, they seem to understand how to be responsible developers.",1
One of the best games I have ever played. Finished the story and both DLCs and still playing.,1
This is a solid game that plays well and earns its place in the tomb raider franchise. Square Enix has nailed it again with both their single and multiplayer.,1
  #recomanded,1
"10/10. Would recommend again. (Yes, I cried.)",1

"The last continuation to date, it's good, but the way you're left hanging is anything but satisfying. 4/5",1
"Very fun game to play, singleplayer and co-op. I love it. And I don't even like singleplayer games so thats saying something.",1
addictive,1
"I love playing Magic, and I wanted to like this game, but I can't recommend a game that I can't even play multiplayer in. I could stomach the long tutorial and even those stupid 'challenges', but only if I could actually play against another human being.",-1
Well it's not the show so there's a plus.,1
"Going into Read Only Memories, I expected the average adventure game trappings that have stuck to the genre over the years. A lot of people have been suggesting that Read Only Memories is the spiritual successor to the SEGA Saturn title Snatcher, that was written and directed by Hideo Kojima back in 1988. Even on the game’s Steam page they say that it was inspired by games like Snatcher. I have never played Snatcher though, in fact I have never been exposed to Snatcher at all despite some interest that I have had in the game. I believe a lot of people are in this same position as well, as the title was on a Saturn and now easily sells for over $300 on sites like ebay, making it not exactly accessible. Due to my inexperience, I was ready for those puzzles that glue you to the ground and laugh while you look for the incredibly specific solution. I assumed that it would be the type of game that I play for a while and come back to, only to still be stuck at the same puzzle I was at before.  So I had a surprising realization about halfway through that this game is an especially different experience from the average adventure game, with more of a focus on player-choice, character development and interaction, and mistakes. If I had to compare Read Only Memories to experiences that I have had in the adventure game genre, I would feel inclined to say that this game is incredibly similar to TellTale’s style of adventure more than anything else I have played. The puzzles are not very difficult, and instead the characters and dialogue choices are the most difficult parts of the game. The world is also well-realized and the game really dives into topics that are going on that could only occur in it’s existence. Comparisons aside, Read Only Memories does things that make it personal and unique from other games in the genre as well.  The developers have a set date and place in mind for the setting of the game: Neo-San Francisco 2064. Which is an interesting choice to make because instead of deciding that the year should go unnamed, something like 20XX, there may be a belief that the events that take place, and the technology that is standard will be feasible by this time in our reality. During this time, there is a conflict of beliefs between two groups of people over the integration of technology in the human biology. There are hybrids, people who utilize technological upgrades to bypass their human limitations, and then there is a movement called #stayhuman who believes that the augmentation of humanity is wrong, and that is corrupts the purity of being a human.   Today we have conflicts that parallel this dispute, such as the acceptance of gay, queer and transgender identification, like there is an idea that someone’s choice may create an “adulterated” human race because it doesn’t align with their religion or their personal beliefs. Because of these conflicts, it honestly is not too difficult to think that approximately 40 years from now there will still be problems with accepting different and new changes in society and that it will still hurt people. The thought is incredibly disheartening, that someone in time is always going to be oppressed because they feel and think different than another human being.  A lot of the game’s theme speaks about humanity, whether or not beings that are not humans can retain sapience, and what we really consider to be human-exclusive. For example, one of the struggles that I found in my robotic sidekick Turing was a conflict of greatness. Turing believes in the beginning of the game that he is top of the line and that there has not been anything as technologically advanced as him ever. As he progresses though, he finds that while he is special for some reasons, but there are also a lot of things about him that aren’t very special at all and I found that to be very human. That is just one of the many things that I interpreted from the game’s theme of humanity and sapience though.  The dialogue and writing in Read Only Memories are the strongest parts of the game. Along the adventure to find out where Turing’s creator, Hayden, went, there are a lot of varied characters that can change depending on which direction the story goes. There are some characters which are staples such as a hacker named TOMCAT who was friends with Hayden, but a lot of characters seem to have more to say in different paths. For instance, in my playthrough of the game there were two boys on a street that were spray painting a business’ wall with street art, and when I tried to stop them they attempted a getaway. I ended up succeeding in foiling their escape and as the game went on I purposefully made decisions to speak with them and befriend them. By the end of my time with the two characters I found out both of them were a lot more complex than what they originally had me believe.  Sometimes these different paths can go awry though. Similar to TellTale’s games, depending on certain paths you take people can live or die. During the period that I played the game I never had any really-close characters die from a choice that I made, but from the options and decisions that I had to made it is apparent that those alternate resolutions are possible. There are also some light puzzle elements that can change the outcome of a situation as well, but they are never too hard.   While I like a lot of these characters, endings and different paths, the end of Read Only Memories really cuts off a lot of the options that made it so personal in the first place. The last part of the game has parts that are basically labeled as your decisions before the final chapter which would lead a person to believe that the decisions they have to make are going to make huge impacts on the last part of the game. This is not true though, instead, the results from actions that were taken earlier in the game occur and funnel you down a corridor of the choices you have made. I think this would work a lot better if it conveyed that this was the situation I was going into.   There are also a lot of static pieces of writing in the game that are just plain hilarious as well. One of the things that I really like about the game is how much there is to read depending on what you interact with. I am a huge explorer when it comes to games so I would try to click on every object in the room before I went on to the next one, and I was originally just happy to see that each of the objects had their own written pieces. Then I found out that most objects that are carried in the inventory in the game can interact with almost every object in the game, even if they do not do anything when interacting with each other, and they all have their own writing as well.  Read Only Memories has patched itself through and into my brain unlike a lot of other games this year. There are a lot of thought provoking ideas about topics that have made me think differently about things that I interact with daily like technology, xenophobia, humanity and time. The story and characters are written so well that when I think about the other endings I may have missed I want to go back and play again so I can see what else happens.The gameplay elements of the game are never too difficult, which I think may make some of the game a bit monotonous for those who do not like to read too much during a game. The rest of the elements such as player choice, themes and story are the real pull though and if those sound appealing then this isn’t a game to miss.",1
-What am I doing? Why did I buy this game?  -BOOOOOOOOOOOBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game shows you the reason why you're still single: you'd rather play dating sim games than go out for a real date! ,1
i would deffinetly recomend this game because it has an interesting story and the graphics complement the games style and the music deffintly makes me wnat to play more,1
"So love this game. I have a penchant for mythological structures and this game explores many aspects thereof. That aside though, it is a novel strategy game in its play and dynamics with an intensly diverse set of creatures and a fair breadth of spell effects (there are a ton of spells and overland spells [rituals] but many are variants on a similar theme, leaving still a lot of variation amidst a ton of spells).   As well, the coop function of having other players be your disciple was well executed and a great way to allow for a grander style of co-op playing.  In all, if you enjoy multiple dynamics in a conquering turn-based game then this is a great game to snag. I have played it so many ways with a wide mix of friends and enjoyed it every time and still find new things to marvel at.",1
"One of the best space games i have played, would be a lot better if you could leave you ship because you do feel confined at some points",1

10/10,1
Game appears to run terrible on new generation cards. Opening the menu causes massive drop in framerate and this drop becomes semi-permanent until you close the game. Menu is slow to respond to any clicks.  Things like this shouldnt be overlooked before release.,-1
"Too short to have a plot without a cliffhanger, too long to not be filled with epic moments. Hours of multiplayer fun, and people still play the damn game to this day. ♥♥♥♥ing co-op mode. How could I not recognize that this game is good? Add this as an expansion to MW Remastered so I can play this ♥♥♥♥ in Ultra-HD on my console too!",1
it is a amazing game butt it has sum hikups ,1
"Good, short game. Purely logic. Might be boring, given that it's mostly the same scenario (except for a couple of levels). Mostly you end up feeling that drive to finish the game. The ending itself could have been more satisfying. Overall, a well-made, minimalistic game that has no real replayability, as you already know which doors to take.",1
Fantastic game. never had any lag issues as many others.  It lives up to being sequel of disonored and its just as good as the first. Really do recommend,1

"This game is 10/10. I recomend Terraria because the fact that there is alot to do in the game. Theres the first and second parts of the game, easy and hard. Easy starts out a little dull but finnishes off oposite of its starting. You think you beat the game your excited but then you have to beat hard mode. Turn that frown upside down, like easy mode it starts our pretty dull what you once thought was op isnt op now. What your fixing to have is whats gonna be op. You will have alot to do after you beat the mid-game boss, there is fixing to be a little surprise. You need to use those skills before and make them better because ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************LOL IM NOT GONNA SPOIL THE GAME FOR YOU BUY THIS GAME NOW AND FIGURE OUT WHAT LYES AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!",1

"Very good sniping-strategy game with realistic gameplay, nice level design and missions.   Graphics are outdated, but the game has cool features - create custom difficulty(many sniping options: wind, gravity, hearth rate), bullet cams, inventory, smart AI, grab bodies and searching them for items - ammos, granades and etc, multiple speed levels for walking/running... I have played it a long time ago but now I bought it on Steam and I am going to finish it again.  Definitely worth buying - you will not regret!",1
A decent little puzzle game for the price. Interested to see a follow up.  Could gain from some softer color pallettes; the white/black contrast was hard on the eyes.,1
AWESOME!  Pros: - Smooth gameplay - Difficulty is moderate - Good Plotline  Cons: - Multiplayer is gradually dying - I hoped the campaign was longer - Not that big variety of arms  Conclusion: Totally worth it if you are on a budget and want something to do.,1
This is exactly what I'm looking for in an exploration game,1
"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is overall a realy fun game to play. At first learning everything might seem overwellming but once you get it its easy. The maps you can play on in career mode are fun and have diffrent objectives each. There's also a sandbox mode in which you have infinte money to build your park. On, a final note you should have patiance when building rollercoasters ( since physics exist ).The only complaint I have is that building a park can feel repititive at times but thats the only complaint I have. So, overall I woud give RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a 85 out of 100.",1
Ok I love Bioshock but this port man... This is a terrible excuse for a port. I understand that if you bought the game you got it for free but still come on! This is port is worse than the original port! Which was so bad most of the time it wouldnt even play sound! If 2K is trying to get people interested in Bioshock again for a possible new game this was probably the worst way to do it.,-1
"Great game if you're looking for a FPS, better then CS:GO. Get the seasons pass, it's worth it too!",1
I'm absolutely hooked on this game! It provides a refreshing take on a military shooter that only CS or red orchestra could pull off. It certainly has a steep learning curve as you cant just go in guns blazing. This game puts teamwork as its priority and you certainly gotta team up to win. Overall a fantastic game :) I just hope that they roll out DLCs for the game as it is quite small at the moment.,1
Bought this game on sale for $4.99. Sunk over 70 hours in it. Pretty good deal in my opinion.,1
"Pretty sweet futuristic hydro-racing. It's got nice water graphics, you can do backflips and there's dubstep.",1

"This is a surprisingly amazing little game. Lots of depth, lots of fun, if you like roguelikes at ALL, get this. You won't be disappointed!",1
"It doesn't matter how many times I play the same maps I absolutly love every minute of it. Each level has a series of random events that range from how the cops enter the building to get you to how specific events are done. The heists range from bank robbery to a druggies panic room to helping a convict escape.  With the addition of the Wolf Pack DLC you get more guns, two more heists and a whole new technition tree to level up in. You don't need to own the DLC to play the new maps too, just join someone else who is hosting them. You just dont get the new stuff.  Another awesome thing about this game is that the devs are really involved with the community, and do take into consideraion what the users want and have implemented changes that the community wants.  This game is a must have for everyone!",1
Lazy repetative garbage.,-1
Really fun game to play with friends and just heisting is fun,1
"Been waiting patiently for this to go on sale after a 'friend' recommended I try both this and 'I Wanna Be The Guy Gaiden' after I asked him about platform games. You never do a level first, second or even third attempt, but when you do, the feeling of satisfaction is almost overwhelming. Just finished Chapter 3, and I have died 854 times. Love it. Buy it right now.",1
"Alien Shooter/ Alien Swarm clone with autofire, which looks worse than screenshots with all bloom and shiny textures. Cloned objects, limited pre-designed interactivity, straight angles, predictable triggers and linear AI also don't help, camera controls are inconvenient, it feels old-time. Maybe it's great as multiplayer, I didn't try it.  Близнец Чужой стрелялки/ Чужой набегалки с функцией автоматической стрельбы. Выглядит хуже, чем на картинках со всеми своими эффектами и блестящими текстурами. Размноженные объекты, ограниченная интерактивность, прямые углы, предсказуемые триггеры и линейный интеллект врагов также не помогают, управление камерой неудобное, ощущение игры из прошлого.

"Cinematic Platformers are brewed slowly and with love. This game is a superb cinematic platformer with a unique approach to using the 2 brothers. I have been playing it with a USB Xbox Controller and it's just plain fun. The puzzles are hard enough to keep you amused for a while, then turn hard to master and become VERY rewarding. The most rewarding part of solving puzzles fluid and sequentially is in fact the Visuals! Visually it's a gem, it is also a gem when it comes to Narrative. If you enjoyed Eric Chahi's 'Another World' or Oddworld's Inhabitants you will enjoy the gameplay. It reminded me of ICO also. I loved this game.",1

"This is what happens when Scooby Doo and Slender have a baby, I am just disappointed by the lack of creepy janitors dressing up as ghosts and saying wonderfully outdated things like 'I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for yer hats'",1
just a game that all love,1
"The game ends in a cliffhanger. It is very clear that this is episode one, as it is stated both in the menu and by the main character in the end. Still, it's a very good game and I'd say it almost works as a 7-hour length demo of the Penumbra: Black Plague.  The story of a man seeking for his father in some vast and deserted area with mutants has been seen often before, but I think that Penumbra's story isn't concentrated on the things you hear from the main character, but instead hidden inside the articles and letters you find throughout the game.  I don't have a lot of time to analyze the awesome athmosphere or the great ending this game has, but I can say that this is a very considerable purchase. I haven't played Amnesia (yet), and this is a very good introduction to the Frictional Games' view of physics and story.  I recommend this title.",1
I found this game slow to respond and it had a outdated feel to its play. I would not recommend this game as there as the control systems are rubbish and it is not easy to play.,-1

"The Park is sure to catch the eye of any horror fan, its setting and atmosphere excitedly screaming: Play me! Not being able to resist the seductive allure of its sinister facade, that is precisely what I did. After two hours it ended, and once again, a promising horror game has left me disgruntled. To be clear, the atmosphere is efficacious and a handful of the scares will leave you picking your fevered heart up off the floor, but the story, characters and themes drag the entire experience down. It would appear Funcom were entering the most unlikeable character of the year contest when they created Lorraine; a vacuous individual with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. She wanders around the park wallowing in self-pity, expressing her nihilistic views; which begs the constant question why she doesn't just turn back and leave, suddenly her loathing will be interrupted by a terrifying manifestation of some eldritch horror, which then prompts her to reminisce about bygone days with notes of ardour. I'm assuming this is meant to convey Lorraine's inner struggle, but it's a complete mess, it's all over the place and the story doesn't help matters at all with its stern intent of being vague. The child is nothing more than a plot device, and only has one line of dialogue if I recall correctly, which is probably a good thing.  If you're just looking for thrills and spills in a creepy environment, then the park is open. Anyone searching for something more, it may be wise to save your money.  5/10",-1

"I do not submit reviews, but this game compels me to make one. I just can't get it out of my mind. Why does it hurt so much?  +One of the emotional games I have ever played. I have never been this close to breaking down since Silent Hill 2. +The story might seem straightforward, but it has so much issues and mature themes involved. You really must pay attention. +Can get quite challenging, which is nice. Though it doesn't really do anything that innovative, it's all fun. +No need to micromanage or grind, unless when doing some very few side things (or when some painful choices have been made). +Lots of options when it comes to party members; all are viable but not all are great. +Humorous in spite of... everything. It's tearing me apart! +Please buy the (very essential) sequel/DLC. +Also, try to thoroughly finish the free prequel (  https://rpgmaker.net/games/4412/  ). It will explain the game's title and give important background, especially for the sequel.",1
"Edit: Apparently the Directors Cut fixes a lot of my original complaints - I haven't played it yet (I mistakenly assumed it was just a few extra cutscenes and maybe an additional mission), but now I feel dumb for wasting so much time trying to slog through the original.   I tried so hard to like this game. As a lifelong fan of the old Fallout games, I was really hoping for something that captured that same feel.   Combat is OK, but constantly feels like a slightly worse version of XCOM combat. Cover is weird. Lots of weapon types simply aren't worth it, apart from diversifying your ammo needs. You can crouch before entering combat, but can't move while crouched. No options for stealth.   Story line is ok, but the dialogue can get genuinely tedious at times. Lots of skills are pretty much useless - they're good for adding a bit of variety, but usually not enough to make them worth more than a single point or two. There are no perks, which was one of my favorite things about the old Fallouts. Lots of bad UI and design features seem to be carried over for no reason other than to make it slightly more similar to old Fallout, which were fine in 1999 but kinda painful now.   Overall, the game is not bad, just... meh. It gets better after the intro missions (which are both awful, especially Ag Center), but not enough to make it possible to really get into it. If you can pick it up at a deep discount, it might be worth it - there is a lot of modding support, which adds a lot to the game.",-1

"Tharsis is basically a board game that's been translated to PC. You control 4 astronauts aboard a badly damaged and extremely unlucky space ship bound for Mars. Each turn you have to assign them to one of 7 sections of the ship and try and keep it from blowing up or the astronauts from dying. This is done by rolling dice and then assigning them to either one of the crisises, research, the special ability of the module that you're in or the special ability of the astronaut.  The game is pretty brutal, you have to survive 10 weeks and you will get 2 or 3 new crisises per week. It's very easy to become overwhelmed or for a random event to completely scupper you. Also the game relies on the dice rolls going your way, an unluck roll can see your astronaut die very easily.  Basically it's a random event generator paired with a dice game. There are definitely strategies that you need to imploy to have any chance of winning but you will need a bit of luck as well. If you're easily frustrated or the type to rage quit when a game becomes totally unfair I would give this a miss. If you're not and you like your board games then I would give this one a go.",1
Great game for the money. Spent less than $1,1
"real good game, head melting is an understatment lol",1
"Well... As it stands right now they made HW2 okay but completely ruined HW1 in every way shape and form.   Formations in the REAL Homeworld don't work properly, they don't stay in proper formation. Capital ships can't maneuver worth beans, Destroyers are no longer the ultimate utility ship of the fleet anymore. They were designed in HW1 to keep pace with and LEAD the frigate lines. Now they're slow, lumbering beasts that just ♥♥♥♥ me off.   Frigates are now made of wet paper bags and fighters are slow and unmaneuverable, meaning point defenses and even heavier weapons could destroy them. Corvettes are now pointless to build. Basically you just build fighters bombers and super-capitals only and they are all that is worth building.  The GUI is NOTHING like the original Homeworld which let you have a very clean experience which didn't block anything out. If you didn't need to see the GUI at that moment, it wasn't there. One of the things that made Homeworld loveable was that it assumed you were intelligent.  Singleplayer's adaptive difficulty from HW1 is now gone from what I can tell and it is pathetically easy for an experienced HW Vet. I had little trouble in the first few missions, which was dissappointing to say the least.  Fuel consumption no longer exists for fighters which means that when I eventually reach the Garden of Kadesh I can expect to be utterly massacred by the Kadeshi. This makes the Support Frigate a useless item. Honestly, why have them anymore at all?! The whole ballance is gone by removing fuel consumption, barring the other things they've utterly mucked up.  I'm happy that they thought it worth the effort to do a remastered edition but they sacrificed the original Homeworld ENTIRELY in order to satisfy the Homeworld 2 players. The thing is... There is a LOT more Homeworld 1 fans that stayed true and bought this than there were Homeworld 2 fans (at least if my group of friends is any indication).  Gearbox... Hear us! Fix your rather glaring mistakes! Homeworld 1 should have been the priority... Especially since THAT is the one that won Game of the Year in 1999. And lets be honest... It had some pretty TALL competition back then for that title. It didn't just win Strategy Game of the Year, it won overall Game of the Year....   Frankly I want a refund because this wasn't true to the Homeworld legacy at all... As far as I am concerned the basic models for the ships are the same and then cut-scenes are the same. The rest is garbage.  ",-1

I have played through the remake of the orginal game offered here on Steam and while there offered a lot of chram and parody to a bunch of embarassing moe fan service, this only offers fan service has the story is not funny (outside of a scene involving Blanc humilating Noire over an embarassing youtube video the game is simply not funny). The only memorable thing is that every speical move done in this game often times leads to a liften skirt or dress to expose the girls panties (Nepgear does this a lot)   full review here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1cy_DGQ9L8 ",-1
fun game except the cpu cheats sometimes. In the game it tells you the likelihood you will win. In this game I had 2 full armies and it said i would likely win which is the game saying you will dominate i lost my whole army and didnt kill any of his men.,1

"Extract from CMDR's LOG....  ------------------------------------- Bought and outfitted the best ship I could afford (with my hard earned [dis]honest creds);  Now ... in a ship [VULTURE] that represents the peak of kick-♥♥♥-itude (at least as far as i've gotten)... I Ieave the dock in search of glory and bounty... mostly bounty... ... since I'm broke.  During a typical bounty hunt, I come across a considerably bigger, heavily armored/shielded/armed group of wanted bounty targets... which I then proceeded to attack... because I'm broke....  After an epic battle, the likes of which can only be seen in this game, after managing to take down my shields, one of the smaller ships in the enemy's wing crashed into me... ... a head-on collision... thus effectively enritching my canopy with a big ♥♥♥♥ing hole right in the middle...  Life support kicks in...  It was at this point that DECISIONS were made... the 4 minutes I had left ( since i didn't bother to upgrade the LS because... you know... expensive shields + I'm broke ... reasons) were barely enough to survive the round trip back to a station with repair equipment.  3:21 O2 time left (Entered Supercruise)  Although amazed by the fact that I can travel through space... doing 50*C ... with no protection in front of my face... I'd swiftly (re)discover that the huge gaping hole in the front of my ship is where a critical part of the navigation system I came to rely on so heavily once stood... and I effectively have no accuracy as to where I'm headed anymore (even though I'm approaching my salvation (dock) at incredible speeds).   1:12 O2 time left (~20 Mm distance from dock)  It's the second time I overshoot the arrival speed/location ... O.M.G.... I'm never going to underestimate the need for a good life support system...   0:30 O2 time left (Docking request granted... distance from landing pad... waaaay to long.... )  0:10 O2 time left (Last stage of depression reached...)  0:06...  0:05... I'll just 0:04... hold my  0:03... breath  0:02... should be  0:01... oka...............................  0.00 : Ship blows up. ( 2m away from destination.... I'm even more broke now than before... + I'm dead. ... I'm gonna start wondering why... just as soon as I wipe the smirk off my dead face.... ) ----------------------------------------------  While not a perfect game, and could do with some more features... this is a game which is worth every cent.  Oh ... and... 5$ (real) for a paint job? .. really? For a game that appeals to my intellectual vanity as much as this one... 5$ extra... for changing the texture on some polygons ... insulting... a really cool texture mind you... but still...",1
"Originally I was sceptical about this game, but it was a really nice surprise for me. Story is pretty good and interesting, event with really weird ending (at least the action one, the puzzle one is a much better). Graphics is nice with solid performance optimization. The problems of this game are the bugs... many bugs. Many times I was stuck behind some stuff and I could get out from there, once I even somehow fall out by the texture to the outdoors and could not go back to the mansion. Also the game is loading too long always and when you encounter a bug you have to load the game over and over again (at least I've encountered critical bug when I had to load the game again only about 3 times). Game is also pretty short, it took me only 7.6 hours to get 56/58 achievements and now to get the rest of them I have to be ingame for 40 hours total... Like WTH, it is not even counting to be in menu, so I could just let the game running and doing something else and now I have to add another monitor to have the possibility to do something else if I want that achievements.  But despite the game having some negatives, I still recommend this game. 7/10",1

Frankly it's just a poor programming.It's just a bug that move you to the center of mobs and you still don't even know that you were tranformed to that point.When you knew it,you have already dead.  Even for new protocol name Lock step did not help you so much ,yeah you won't die because of lag and desyncronization but you would die because of slow respond scene.it has become delay instead of lag.  Let's come up with the game mechanic.  First the over size 1500+ passive skill may seems to be so impressive but actualy the mass passive skill tree did not do a damn thing it's just add up more and more attributes to your stats but they affect the playstyle very few.  The most important thing is legacy gear which is really help you so much.You are really need to equip with legendary gear and all of things that you have done before is useless.  The skill support gem building system is very impressive for me but in the end there is no need at all when you got all legacy gear. You just rush in and spam one skill with massive damage and you won't die so easily except lag.  What's the point of great system which you don't need to use it anymore when your character has become OP.  I do really want to support this game but I can not afford it with this lag.",-1

Want to be a killer, taking your foes on face to face killing them in cold blood, go ahead and to so.  Use various weapons, take advantage of the inviroment, kill nobody? Kill everybody? Be the good man, sacrificing yourself for the right cause or be the greedy devil, slaying your way through the innocents.  But remember... everything you do has a consequense and will determine what struggles that lies ahead.  Dishonored 10/10 A challenge, a gift and worth every penny to all you gamers out there.",1
get the game u make billons with lemons,1
Great game and great developers however after 450 hours it got kinda stale for me but for those 450 hours on a free game is great i recommend everyone to atleast try it.   Edit: I have come back to this game and iam having so much fun again they really did a great job with updates Can't wait to see more from them.,1
"Invalidated purchase by intending to release and sell who knows how many newer, better versions that they want customers to buy and test.",-1
"This game unfortunaltely dies out quickly.Unless you have plenty of frined to play with(but the online services are buggy as ♥♥♥♥ anyways),you are not going to get much enjoyment out of this game.Sorry",-1
Great classic city builder. Shouldn't be $19 or more,1
"This Masterpiece in gaming lacks a story, but makes up and oustounding gameplay and amzaing graphics. Not only is this game great to look at, its easy to run. A great starter game. It has local co-op so you can play it with your pals, the split-screen makes it great for parties and social gatherings. you can hook it up to the tv for hours of fun. The driving is realistic and cartoony enough to give you a unique racing experience. All together this game can go toe to toe with fallout 4, rainbow 6, or any other triple a title. In conclusion, this game cured my aids, which ment I didn't have to pay so much for my medical bills. so i quit my night job because i only worked there for the medical bills in the first place, giving me more time to play Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  A Masterpiece in gaming",1
My Games Rating: 6/10*  ,1
"Punishing, but really enjoyable little rougelike with emphasis on fast paced action and easy to learn but difficult to master classes. Each class has it's own set of skills which will significantly change the way you play, but unfortunately only one (out of ten) is available from the start.  As with most rougelikes; levels, items and enemies are procedurally generated and permadeath is enabled but game never feels unfair, since every playthrough offers something new. Due to it's difficulty and random nature it will require speed, precision and adaptability. Luckily there are a lot of items spread out around the level that will provide passive and active bonuses like increased rate of fire or various status effects, as well as more interesting ones which I'm not going to spoil since discovering new item and monster log entries will be your main source of accomplishment in early stages of the game. However as you unlock more drops and get familiar with each class, things will get easier. This is the point where time becomes your biggest enemy (well...besides all the other big enemies). Game implements a timer in the upper right corner that will gradually increase difficulty as time passes, forcing you to find a balance between becoming more powerful and just getting to the next level with all your bits intact. It provides a nice compromise, keeping a challenging gameplay, but still providing the feeling of controling an unstopabble killing machine.   There are some problems on the technical side, like the occasional but gut-wrenching crash that will erase your progress and leave you sobbing, unresponsive controls in menus (especially if you're using gamepad) and problems with online co-op conectivity and Steam achievements. I would also be amiss not to mention brilliant sountrack and appealing pixel art.  All in all, in a sea of rougelikes this one manages to stand on it's own, providing responsive shooting mechanics, hordes of different enemies and items and a great balance between frustrating and adrenaline-pumping gameplay. A great value for money.",1
a Great game !!! :D,1

Bugged and unbalanced. Not fun to play.,-1

Assassin's Creed 2 Deluxe Edition Is A Great Game!!! I Love The Renovations Of Businesses And The Puzzles In The Templar Treasure Tombs!!!,1
"This game is unique, and definetely on my list of games i'd recommend to new PC gamers, and also everyone who hasn't played it yet ofcourse.",1
WARNING! Only play this game if you dont have friends its not worth it losing them if you keep killing them in one on one combat. outher than that it is brilliant. P.S looking for someone who is willing to play with me even if they cant get used to the controls or die repeatedly.,1
"Theres lots to do to keep you busy, the game had some saving problems in the career, but I finsihed it before the problems started accuring. There are some cool DLC's that will keep you coming back for a while longer.",1
"They said capitalism is easy. You just need one click and you get the money. But they forcibly ask me to buy their gold. This game is only about number, nothing else. Nothing good about it. But why I keep buying their gold. It's just a number anyway. Well, maybe that's how capitalism brainwash you",1
Perfect Game i love it :D,1
"Took my time to fully write a review. Solid 7.5/10 for lack of content.  (Main Campaign is 33% of completion. Making all your weapons legendary is another 33%, and the remainder is collectables.)  Shadow of Mordor is a nice change of pace from the typical Assassin's Creed franchise, it does have quite a lot of similarities in terms of combat, movement, and things of that nature. However the new Nemesis system is a game changer allowing some 'customization' to gameplay.  Early on in the game you definately need to pick your battles, the gameplay seems to not reward that kind of gameplay at the start. (SoM definitely wants you to take the stealthier approach near the beginning but later on you become almost Godly in battle.)  Later on, after you complete the main campaign you'll find that 'post campaign' is essentially exactly the same as the core gameplay, minus nice cinimatic breaks from all the gore.  Uruk's (Orc) for the most part are very well done. The majority of Orc's in the game are very unique minus the voice acting. (Only about 5 voice actors if I counted correctly.) You'll start to go crazy hearing Captain A have the exact same voice/dialog as Captain F, Q, M, and L despite their appearence to be completely different.  Issues with the game?  -Combat can get boring at times, but its rare. -There are multiple instances where you will randomly 'freeze' in place in terms of climbing up walls, jumping over a barrel, etc. -Not enough variations in voice actos/dialog for 'bosses.' -Way too many 'chores' not enough story telling.  Definately worth the buy.",1
please get this game! this game is a best game ever. Buy it or download the game trial. The game trial is free!,1
Still working on the achivement to get good enough at drawing to quit my day job,1
Very fun game with a new spin on it. A short but interesting story. Plenty of challenges and replayability.,1
"This game is easy to learn for everybody who is new to strategy games. The tutorials are really helpfull and in the normal campaigns you'll get hints on how to play with your nation.  It is quite historically correct, which makes it also really interesting. And because you can choose your own difficulty it's challenging for beginners as well as more experienced players.  You can choose from a bunch of nations to play the campaign with. Thanks to that you can spend many hours on this game without getting bored.   The diplomacy features in this game are quite good, but they could be better. Religion is a great factor and the historical alliances are not easily broken, while in reality the nations switched alliances almost every generation.  But besides that I'll recommend this game to everyone who likes strategy games or history games and who doesn't like to see to many complicated features to control a nation.",1
"bad hit detection and its still a pay to win game with balanced guns, but guess what u can just buy armor to build ur hp way up. worthless dont even bother to play its not fun unless your willing to spend 100$ to make a nice character. why even bother to do that when u could buy battlefield 4 or Call of Duty Ghosts both for less? dont waste ur time.",-1
Can confirm this game has passed the test of time.,1
"Short but very staisfying first person platformer, great level design with solid game mechanics.  Good value for the miniscule price tag and worth every minute of game play.  Short but Sweet",1
"This game is fun. Flat out. The combat is very unique. You give commands to your Sam(s), then combat runs for 5 seconds (with you moving your Sam(s) vertically). Then you get to give new commands. This can include switching guns, using items, etc.  Well worth the $5 I spent on it.",1
"EVE is like no other game you have EVER playe before. I LOVE EVE, and EVE LOVES ME. 100000/10 -The World",1
I love the game it has a few bugs but nothing which would make me want to stop playing. I cant wait for future updates.,1
enjoyed the game for only a few minutes...,1
Addictive game that can be really frustrating but that's part of the fun. Wouldnt' pay more than 50 cents for it though,1
Cool gameplay and amazing atmosphere (thanks to in game music).,1
it's like GTA. but chinese and don't forget the kungfu,1
"Cool game, it's still better than the old engine they ran I mean.. The update you know guys... Damn. I wish something cool that is up-to-my-mind but it is not impossible because I had some problem of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I really like that game and I prefer you to try it, have fun good-luck.",1
Space ninjas. Wall running. Upgrades for everything. 'Nuff said.,1
"It's so addicting. I have a love/hate relationship with it and that about sums up this clicker.   It's incredibly satisfying to watch the damage grow exponentially and the monsters are cute with their little animations. I love it. However, it's become difficult to walk away from it for any length of time. I used to spend my time reading, writing, with the occasional gaming, but now just about every waking moment I'm playing this game. I hate it. But it's so addicting and I love it.  So, be warned: if you get it, whatever social life you have may very well suffer and your day-to-day activities may begin to revolve around this game.  But it's all fun.",1
A great indie game about making games.,1
"I think this a great MMO with unique gameplay and surroundings, a good story and has loads of things to choose from.",1
"Not easy, but satisfying when you get successful. ",1
"Batman Arkham Knight was a disaster on the pc at launch. I picked it up about a month or 2 ago as I had nothing to play. The game still struggles to maintain 60fps in most areas of the game. But the worst offender is the batmobile... The batmobile is basically a frame killer. You could be doing 60fps with about 5fps dips then all of a sudden you hop in the batmobile and BAM! 45fps!?!? The game is pretty fun with the mod that allows you to free roam as most of the side characters (Harley Quinn etc) but that itself can be quite taxing. The gameplay can become really repetitve especially when you have to open doors for your batmobile. The game also becomes boring quickly and heres why: Its set in 1 night even after you finish the game its still the same night. Also the city evacuated at the start of the game leaving thugs to rule the streets... This is boring as ♥♥♥♥ seeing as everytime you land on the ground a thug with all of his other identical twin ai come running at you for a fight. The story is alright. 5/10. I'm gonna recommend this to any person who loves batman as you'll get a kick out of it for a few hours, or maybe more.",1
"it's just simply not good, it's not that enjoyable, i could care less about the graphics, but i hope this isn't a finished product. there just isn't enough depth, and the 'skills' are poorly setup, not enjoyable, also no tutorials, hints etc. it's very meh, buy at 75% off if you're feeling brave, otherwise don't bother",-1
I used the Password 'Justin Bailey' and got a naked Man. 11/10   ps. i like the reference :D,1
"  Its a great game, I spent 14 mins on it, And loved it, I had to restart my computer doe to Get on facebook, etc. When i did, All of a sudden it says i can't play it, This is a good game, So i recommend it, It has Pros, and cons, Great job devs :3",1
Simple and fun. I had a great time with all the extra content. This game is very clever and silly.,1
Well it's a Trion Worlds game so the model by which you buy and unlock things is pretty mediocre. More importantly I couldn't find a PVP match.,-1
"This is a unique RPG with a fantastic soundtrack, charming character design, clever dialogue, and a very engaging story with moments that can break or warm your heart. Your choices DO matter.",1
One of the best Call of Duty games ever created. Zombies is amazing and the mods are fantastic.,1
"Buy this for the music alone. The videos you see on here and on youtube do the game justice, the mechanics are so fluid, very difficult at first but when they click it all becomes worth it. I like it how all the negative reviews for this game are because its too difficult. If its too difficult there are options to make your experience more user friendly such as steer assist and automatic gearing. I love the way this game is layed out, there is no pressure to perform well and the rewards from good driving are rewarding enough. There are leaderboards if you want to get serious. The overall feel and look of the game is just nice to experience. So far I have had no problems or negative thoughts on it however i would like to see an infinite mode where there are no boundaries. I really hope this game does well. id probably give this game a 9/10 based on the fact that i feel that it achieves what it set out to do.",1
"Played it for a while. It's a pretty good game altogether, but not my taste. I prefer shooters where cover and headshots really impact the game, but this game does neither. Sure, headshots give double damage, but the enemy still needs 30 shots to go down. I can see how many people would like this game, but I personally don't. I'm giving it a positive review because I think it's very solid, good lore, good enemies, nice variety of weapons, impressive online experience (playing with others actually increases enjoyability, which is rare in mmo shooters nowadays), massive world to explore and a pleasing visual art style. I dislike it personally due to a lack of direction at the beginning, as I came for a mount promotion from another game, and I dislike how the interactions with npc work (stale animations, almost no cutscenes, straightup lame characters at times) and having a hard time to find places for me to level have made this game a bit cringy to me. I advice you to play it nontheless, because I think people could enjoy this enough to sink a quick 300 hours into it.",1
Great music 'game'. The whole playthrough was pure art.,1
"Extremely fun space simulator that is absolutely worth the price of admission.  This is a rare title in which gameplay makes up for dull and recycled in-game missions. Having access to both an inertial dampening flight system and pure newtonian physics mode adds an entirely new dimension to space travel and combat. Dogfighting becomes more like a well calculated jousting match and mastering your sliding techniques allows you to overcome enemies with much larger firepower. This is a game that rewards patience and experience.  While some of the art looks fantastic (planets from a distance), low resolution textures on space stations, backgrounds and ships hinders the experience slightly. Mods are available to help slightly rectify this problem.  Great news is this games support for Surround/Eyefinity AND gamepad/joystick setups is phenomenal.  Most other titles require the use of a third party application/driver that merges multiple joysticks together, however Evochron allows you to map each separately. This is fantastic for people with separated HOTAS systems (ie T.16000M Joystick + Saitek Throttle)   Warning to New Pilots: When the game begins it will seem very daunting. After the tutorial section, play with the various tools at your disposal and you will catch on very quickly. Reach out to the amazing community if you are in need of help, or tune into a Let's Play series that can help jumpstart you into the universe.  ",1
"I've been wondering how to write a review for what has instantly become my favorite game of 2015 without spoiling the experience. This is what I've come up with:  Undertale is a story driven game with some game mechanics thrown in as a way to create an interactive (and sometimes challenging) expression of the themes the game deals with. Most of these mechanics come from the JRPG and bullet hell genres, though almost every encounter is carefully crafted to subvert your expectations (as much as the game's logic). As a result, this game is not for everyone.  Undertale will only interest you if you are looking for something that will make you THINK and make you FEEL. If you are looking to relax and have mindless FUN, you may want to look elsewhere. That being said, Undertale is a lot of FUN if you enjoy games that make you THINK and FEEL. Otherwise, it might HURT you.  In Undertale, you play a young child who has fallen into a land ruled by monsters. Your journey is a process of discovery where you must decide between two basic options: FIGHT or MERCY. What happens along the way depends entirely on how you resolve that decision, and whatever path you choose, the game will make your next decision harder to make.  The majority of the game is composed of fairly rudimentary puzzles. The gameplay difficulty arrises from a combination of the increasingly absurd bullet hell game and the out of the box thinking demanded to progress. Overall, the difficulty never gets too high, but it's enough to keep things interesting. Most players will get a little furstrated at times, but the game is fairly aware of this and keeps you from losing the determination to continue.  Most importantly, Undertale is a deconstruction of video games (particularly RPGs). You can't play this game without walking away looking at games in a broader light. This is a game that will, in its own small way, expand your consciousness. That alone makes it more than worth it's $10 entry fee.  This is easily my favorite game on Steam. I cannot recommend it enough.",1
Do not play if you have anger issues.,1
"If I were to describe Dispatcher -- a survival horror game developed by CivilSavages – in a single sentence, it would have to be: “Dispatcher is a poor man’s Alien: Isolation”  You play as a crew member on the space ship Dispatcher. But something has gone wrong, and a sinister extra-terrestrial being is now on the hunt for every human aboard, including you. It is your goal to evacuate yourself off of the Dispatcher and escape the horrors of space and its predator.   That’s the basic gist of the game. You’ll be collecting pill bottles to restore health, batteries to keep your flashlight alive, notes, key cards, power fuses and so on; all the while being hunted by the monsters.  But here’s the thing… this game is cheap as all hell. I can’t tell you how many times an alien spotted me from who-knows where, only to chase me down and kill me before I could even flinch. Their ability to spot and chase the player is stupidly quick, and you won’t have a chance to react before getting eaten alive. Hiding in vents, behind objects or any sort of barrier is a total waste of time. The only way to properly evade your pursuer is to lock yourself inside a storage closet or bathroom, and if you aren’t situated directly next to one of these rooms… well, you’re dead. There’s even an enemy who looks like a floating red orb, and the very second it touches you, its game over. Its things like these that make the game less horrifying and more irritating. And don’t get me started on the plethora of traps scattered across the Dispatcher. Mines, radioactive sludge, even electrified explosives. When the player is running from the monster, he/she won’t be looking down at the floor to avoid hazards. It’s just another cheap mechanic to get you killed.  As mentioned before, the player’s only objective is to find keycards and fuses to open specific doors, but the ship’s layout is so basic and similar that it’ll take you ten minutes before realizing you’ve been walking in a circle.   But thankfully, there are some pros to this game. Sound design is top notch, there is a unique and fun character creation mechanic that RPG fans will feel right at home with, there’s multiplayer, and the Unreal engine looks better than ever.  But with all this game’s short comings, I just don’t see the worth in Dispatcher. The entirety of its content can be played in one of Alien: Isolation’s DLC survival missions, and it’s far more frustrating than it is scary.  To sum it up, Dispatcher still feels like it’s in early access, and what it sets out to achieve has already been done by better horror games.",-1

Wanna be son of the Dark Lord? Here you are then.  Great game!,1
"I've tried this game twice now. its awefull, with clunkey mmo game play",-1
I'd suggest picking up 'Dead Realm' rather than this game as  i believe the developers no longer work on Damned. I've changed  my review to negative simply because there was always very little  content in this game and now how the developers have basically  bailed on further updates leaving the current version of the game  empty and without any real objectives:( 3/10,-1
Amazing game even though it is quite fast-end-able. Played with my friend in 6h or less. Still a great game.,1
"This is one of the most fun games I have gotten my hands upon. It has a simplistic style of gameplay that brings hours of fun with all the new people you meet and possibilities across the way. Although it is a little challenging to rank up, it's not so hard if you have a good team that actually tries to help each other. The leveling system has unique perks and a variety of items you can bring into the fray. I can't organize a lobby of friends together which is a little dissapointing, but it will eventually and hopefully be added in later updates. Overall I recommend you play this game, it's countless fun and has many possibilities, at least for me.",1
This game doubled my heart beat rate it was so intense      10/10 would be intensified again,1
Very good cyber punk. . . but only to play once. . . pity,1
Great little gem of a game. Visually appealing with an awesome soundtrack.,1
"After 20h of gameplay, i'd say i like the game itself in all categories but in general, i would recommend waiting for a discount because it might not fit your sense of humor perfectly",1
Collaborate to make music with your buds you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! And do it live! And it's free!  (buggy as ♥♥♥♥ though sometimes) ,1
Bowie's in space and so is this game.,1
Relaxing game. I really enjoyed it.,1
Got banned cause a hacker changed my rank T_T,1
This is the greatest Fighting game. so much fun,1
"This game understands challenge. It makes it hard, but never too hard. It helps get your skills up. The world and levels are well designed and quite pretty and quite barren and lonely. Is good. You'll have heard of this game, and you might be thinking it's too hard. No. You can do it, you just need to put the effort in and get good at it. And it's so damn fulfilling when you pull anything off. Aww yeah. BUY IT IT'S REALLY GOOD (It's 'I played it for seventy hours and could play it way more without getting bored' good. It took me that long to complete the ♥♥♥♥er + the DLC that comes with the Prepare To Die edition. The DLC is quite short but has some great bosses. Don't miss out, but leave it to near the end of the game so you're good enough to cope with dem bosses.) (Also I recommend checking a guide once you've finished an area, just so you can be sure you've got everything - 'cause some things that you really need are not obvious and it's kinda silly in that regard. Also sometimes it hides bonfires (save points) which can be a ♥♥♥♥, so maybe use a guide for that if you're having trouble.)",1
this game ♥♥♥♥ed me up fam,1
"Raiding tombs is an optional sidequest.  6/10, gets grindy (and drawn out) mid-game, but Lara's hot bod makes up for it.  i'd rate neutral, but Steam doesn't let you do that, and imho the game wasn't an entire waste of cash.",1
"One good way I feel to describe this game is as follows: 'You've played more expensive games for shorter times'. It has a simple combat model but is kept fresh by the use of procedural level generation as you descend into the labyrinth. It's an entertaining adaptation of a great piece of Greek mythology which seems to have been overlooked as far as gaming forays go. For the price point you really can't go wrong if you enjoy first person fighting games like Dark Messiah of Might and Magic or Chivalry DW. It's a nice choice for those times you don't feel like committing to a multiplayer game and want to battle your way through some dungeons. All this with mild horror themes piled on top. It's all substance, so don't expect too much cinematic filler. Just think of the games you played when you were younger.",1
"I was very late to the Batman: Arkham series in general, so I decided to start from the beginning with Asylum and see if it really was as good as others were claiming. Boy was it worth way more than the $4.99 I paid. In the past I've found it very hard to complete games as so many seem so uninspiring, but this one inspired me to keep playing hour after hour. The story kept me interested while the free flow combat kept my adrenaline pumping. The ability to tailor the combat to my liking with whatever abilities I wanted to use was incredible.   However, the most impressive part to me were the challenges. No matter the amount of frustration, I found myself replaying each challenge over and over. The feeling of completing just one more combat or predator challenge medal was astounding. Getting all 48 made me act like a little kid at Christmas. Even the cat was looking at me funny.  The only way that this game could have been better is if it was entirely in the 1960s Batman series environment. BANG. POW.",1
"Well, I would love to say that this review is based upon the actual game itself, but as you can see I've only 'played' 5 minutes of it. It appears that this game is sadly incompatable with my computer; Windows 7 (64-Bit) with 8GB of DDR-3, an AMD FX-8320 (8-Core) processor, and an NVidia based graphics card. So how did I get 5 minutes of game play?  Well, first I tried to start the game and had an immediate crash, before the screen even popped up. Tried compatability mode for XP (SP3) and got a black window, followed by a crash. Added administrator privlidges, crash. Installed the supplyed PhysX software, already had a newer version. Installed he supplied DirectX, still crashed.  So technically all the 5 minutes of playing the game was actually a combined 5 minutes trying to START the game. I was really looking forward to trying out this game. Instead, I'm really thankful I got it in a humble bundle instead of paying for it separately.  DON'T BUY IT unless you're ABSOLUTELY SURE the game will run on your computer!",-1
I like the part where I waited for 400 minutes to play the game.,-1
"This game is just awesome. It's Dota2, LoL, HoN but there is no farming, only fighting. There are 28 characters to choose from and you battle at 5v5, 3v3 or 2v2 arena till death. Mostly 3v3, as it is the most common one and has ranked play in it. There are also tournaments in the game that give rewards. The normal 3v3 games are fast 3-15min depending on how good the players are. Learning the game is quite easy and if you don't have a lot of time this game is great. Come play it!",1
"This game has it all. Pixels, explosions, stopping explosions, and urinating in a space ship's engine. In this point and click game, you choose very basic commands and McPixel does them by clicking an object, or clicking one object, then clicking another. You can never really know what he is going to do or if it will solve the level, but that's not the point. The point is that you get to see him stick an electric razor up his ♥♥♥ and rub it on Batman's face.",1
"If there was ever anything to challenge Diablo 3 and Blizzard, this is it. Nothing quite comes close, and nothing on this scale. Impressive is the word to use.",1
my life was useless but I found this game. Now it's useless but I have something majestic in my library,1
Just buy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead. This game is terribly clunky.,-1
"It's quite a nice little game that manages to do a fairly nice job of mixing old-school 'Run-and-Gun' FPS gameplay with newer 'Cover-based Shooter' FPS Gameplay, and the Tower Defence elements are fairly simple (if a little snobby as to where you can and can't place things at times), but fun nonetheless.  So why does this reccomendation read 'Not Reccommended?'  Because Iron Grip: Warlord is (at least in my opinion) a game that is best played multiplayer, and the fact that Steam versions and non-Steam versions seem to be more-or-less incompatible combined with the games age means pretty much NOBODY is playing this multiplayer any more.",-1
loved it so much. great series.,1
It's fun as hell lmao,1
Really fun lot of game modes and customization i recommend this :),1
I bought this gaming thinking it was gonna be great and it turned out to be disapointing. The game is slow and doesn't pick up speed. the anamatronics are easy to avoided and stop and if you somehow fail aren't even scary. I wouldn't buy this game no matter what the price.,-1
"So, let's forget about all the hype that was generated back then and look at Watch_Dogs with the right perspective. Let us forget about all the people bashing this game for the most idiotic reasons. Let us... review Watch_Dogs:  Let me start by saying that this game isn't perfect. It doesn't have to be. As long as it's fun. And although the game manages to frustrate sometimes, it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.  Getting the game to run properly was a task of its own when the game just released. With Uplay being the main problem here. Ubisoft managed to fix things fairly quickly and after a small delay we were finally playing the long awaited Watch_Dogs. Then came the second problem: optimization problems. Vysnc totally breaks this game. It took me a moment to figure out and once it's disabled (and forced via your videocard's control panel) everything runs fairly smooth, with an ocassional hiccup here and there. I never managed to get below 58fps, which is a good sign.  Visually the game looks impressive. As long as you don't compare it with its E3 reveal you won't notice a thing. It's a detailed city with some amazing locations and unfortunately a bit of pop-up (objects suddenly appearing out of thin air). Character models looks great, cars shine and reflect nicely, the water looks amazing and the city just feels alive, filled with tons of people. Really impressive stuff. The music, on the other hand, I didn't like but that's a matter of taste. The sounds and voice acting were excellent, however.  Gameplay wise the game is less impressive but still great fun. Hacking is done by the press of a button and it's because it's so easy that it's fun. I don't want to hack in a realistic way, that takes away all the fun. Besides, there are some mini games that already give you the illusion that you're hacking something (ok, it still does a poor job there, but it's more complex than pressing a button at least).  It all begins slowly but after a few hours you have the ability to upgrade all of your skills/perks. And that's where the game opens up. Investing your points in your Hacking skill tree isn't necessary but it makes the game that more fun. Disabling helicopters and destroying cars in pursuit is wonderful and makes you feel powerful. When you're driving there's a handy button to look back. It's ideal for hacking stuff when you're being chased. Hacking something at the right time will slow down the action and show the moment in excellent Burnout-like detail. The missions also allow the player to use stealth. This doesn't always work like it should, but detonating bombs that your enemies are carrying or exploding a fusebox when an enemy is nearby feels very satisfying. Especially if you finish the mission without being detected. And even if you're detected you can kill your enemies by using the many, many weapons available. Time can also be slowed down so that you can aim better and kill off your enemies faster. There are plenty of ways to complete a mission.  There are also plenty of story missions to complete (which is a little bit cliche, but interesting nevertheless) and finishing nothing but the story should take about 15 hours. But of course, that's not why you're playing Watch_Dogs. You want side activities, mini-games, collectibles, et cetera. Let me tell you that Watch_Dogs has more than enough content in that area. When I finished the game I had completed about 40% of the entire game. 100% will take you at least 50-75 hours. There are augmented reality games, side missions, people to hack for money/music or cars. There are mysteries to solve, towers to unlock, you name it. It's chock full of content.  And then there's the multiplayer, which is partly integrated in your single-player experience. At any time you can be hacked by a random person. When you're being hacked you have a few minutes to find the person that's trying to hack you (there's a perimeter in which you have to search). Sounds simple, I know, but it can be really hard. Players can stand between tons of non-player characters and hide behind plenty of objects. It's pretty tense and so much fun. And obviously, you can do the same thing. It's a great experience and a really unique one.  Watch_Dogs is one of my favorite games of the year. No, it's not the best game by any means. There's plenty of room for perfection, but I'm sure the next one will give us even more stuff to do, next to adding and improving features. Sure, it's a hefty price to pay, but there's so much gameplay in it. Believe me when I say that it really *is* worth the asking price. But please, in any case, try it for yourself. Clear your mind and don't let other people try to influence you (too much).  [Rating: 89/100]",1
"i play, game shoot. i rcmnd this game for people who like nba",1
"Counter-Strike: Source is very enjoyable. Rough for me at times. I play only single-player with bots. I really feel it is enjoyable. I don't have anything more to say than my support for its gameplay.  I have played 'Halo' titles also, and the 'Call of Duty' titles, and all 'DOOM' titles. I would recommend this game to any player who has existing 'first-person-shooter' game experience, but not as a starting point. It's rather rough and I feel long-term experience with the genre would help playthrough a great deal.  You may also want to have comforting friend bases. I understand the people who play this game can often be rough with treatment because they are older men who have very big egos revolving around how well they play. And they wouldn't want you to join their play on the Internet just to be a waste of a player slot. This is how I feel.  I do not have much to say about the technicalities of the game title or anything which could actually benefit decision making when reading reviews to determine game playability. I just feel you'd probably already want to have experience with first person shooter games. You'd want to be aware and conscious of your actions, and attempt to make efficient decisions quickly. It is a game using modern firearms to murder other humans. Good grief.",1

"Well i enjoy the game when its working. In my 12 hours of playing (btw i didn't play for 12 hours i just forgot to close it) it has for at least 3 to 4 hours kept timing me out of the game. Soooo keep that in mind if you want to try it out.  As i said i enjoy the gameplay, but i don't like the waiting. so i would rate it 5,5 out of 10.  Btw my internett is not ♥♥♥♥ it's pretty good!   Sorry Ca.   And i like Ca so i would recomend this game. It's just the waiting that keeps anoying me.",1
"It's a decent games....but,with less existence player in the servers its a shame.Plus,there's no singleplayer mode...not recommended as you'll play it less because of the limitation.Only buy if you have friends play it or want to play it together with you.Until then only,you could have a blast and limitless times of monkey shootings gun.",-1
Game is Fun and i have not had any issues playing it. just had to enable vsync in the config file to get rid of the screen tearing and then it runs at a solid 30fps with no drops. hopefully they will patch in 60 fps later...,1
GREAT GAMEPLAY MECHANISM AND GAMEPLAY CHEMISTRY BUT TOO MUCH USAGE OF BATMOBILE (maybe just tone it down a little bit 'cause it's becoming more stale overtime),1
"So happy this game is finally released on Steam! I adored the first one 'Stair dismount' and this one is even better than the first one being with cars! I do love fast cars and all that, and this game is perfect for having fun and laughing when you see all the accidents. You can also costumize your character being able to place a face of someone you hate and you can also add any car logo you want, like i chose Bugatti :D. Love this game and i'm looking forward to new updates! Have fun playing it yourselves!",1
"Where do I start?   Final Fantasy Type - 0 is probably my favorite FF to date, even back when I played it on the PSP. It was a wierd turn of direction for Square, but damn was it an awesome direction to go towards. Just how Sega went a different direction with Sonic by making Shadow the Hedgehog have guns and violence, Square went a different direction with Type-0 with possibly one of the most brutal and jarring intro's to a Final Fantasy game we've seen to date. The radical departure might unease some die-hard fans, but for others it brought to light a different perspective in the Final Fantasy universe that we haven't seen.  Anyways, let's talk about the Graphics.  FF: Type - 0's HD remake has done a splendid job of remaking a PSP game into a solid PC game. As a person who generally had little faith in Square's ports (Having experienced FFXIII Being Awful, as well as FFXIII - 2) I was pretty sketchy coming into it, expecting some horribly botched port that wouldn't be worth the time of day. I was pleasantly surprised and can say that without a doubt, this is probably the best port Square's done to date for a Final Fantasy game.   The graphics have been overhauled, yet there are still remnants of it's PSP origin. Namely, some of the sprite and texture work can still be blotchy/sketchy in some areas. However, they've made an already impressively and beautiful Akademia on the PSP look even more awesome by HD'ing it. If you look at the scenery of some of the area's too, and all the pretty effects they added you can take a small moment to enjoy what they've done with the game. But let's face it, you don't care about that. You probably have one jarring question that is going to determine whether or not you buy this game.   Is it 60 FPS?  No. It's not.   Why? It's because the game itself is dependant on things operating at that speed. Try going into skyrim and disabling your frame limiter and Vsync and watch the physics engine go willy nilly. You're asking for the same thing here by complaining that you want the game to be in 60 FPS.   For once in my life, I'm defending 30FPS. ......-Facepalm- But it's true. Despite me also believing it should be an industry standard, as a person who played this on the PSP and thought the game ran -extremely- well for a PSP game despite all the crap that was happening, the same feeling extends to the PC. There are times when I hardly notice the 30 FPS either to be honest. And let me give you a pro tip. If you feel the games too slow, they introduced a speed up button to the game that makes everything move at 1.5x speed, essentially making the game feel faster both frame wise and pace-wise.   The graphics options are actually pretty plentiful, if we're being biased towards Square. The jarring fail here though is their locked resolutions of either 1920x1080p or 1280 x 720. Personally, my PC can't handle the game at 1920x1080p with all of the settings, so I usually play in a windowed mode because it also lets me keep track of other tasks on my PC. You have the options of customizing shadows, motion blur effects (which are an awesome addition to make the game feel more cinematic and action-y &lt;--- Legit word, I promise)     Now let's talk about the Gameplay.   Type-0 is a radical departure from it's predacessors in that it's a hack and slash based game. With an impressive roster of FOURTEEN PLAYABLE CHARACTERS, EACH INCREDIBLY UNIQUE IN THEIR GAMEPLAY, you're guaranteed to find at least one member of class zero that suits your fancy. My personal favorite is Seven.   Battles happen as thus: You have your typical overfield random battles, that throw you in a sandbox-like area where you duke it out with the enemy forces in real-time hack and slash based combat. When you defeat the enemy forces, there's a chance that you have the ability to 'go another round' with the same enemies, only they'll be stronger. You can do this up to four times, and the enemies levels will increase, as well as the chance of them becoming enraged. (they don't flinch and deal stupid amounts of damage)   Combat itself in the game is fast-paced and has a degree of skill to it. Essentially if you're locked onto a target a 'Kill Marker' will appear on an enemy if it's in a position that leaves it vulnerable. Striking an enemy while this 'Kill Marker' is up let's you score a critical hit that usually will kill the creature in one hit.  Missions are a bit different, as they usually have some relevance to the story and pit you in a location against enemy forces. These are replayable from the main menu and can be done as many times as you want, which is a cool function if you really liked a particular mission.  When you're not in missions, you're at Akademia which is your home area. You're given a certain number of 'Hours' that you can spend before your next missions starts. This is my only complain about the game, because you have to basically play through the game multiple times to experience all of Academia's scenes, as you simply won't have enough time to get through all of them. Missing events between missions can also prevent you from seeing that event in the future too, so be careful.   Eidolon's make a comback in this game in possibly their most epic form, as you can actually play as the Eidolons, or let them fight on their own. You do this by sacrificing one of 12 members of Class zero during a mission. (12, because two aren't a part of it originally and are not under the same special circumstances as the rest of class zero) It's an epic feeling to rampage across the field as an Eidolon, and it's something I guarantee you'll fall in love with as well.   When one of your classmates falls, you can replace them on the fly with other members of class zero if they go down. You can also additionally recieve backup from Akademia itself which lets you earn some points towards unlocking some nice gear.  When I finally get around to beating it this time around and actually being able to understand the story, i'll give a story evaluation here as well, so for now this will have to do. I highly recommend picking it up, as it's a gem and deserved to be given a two-hour shot at least.   I hope you enjoy it as much as I have so far~",1
THE GOOD  No game breaking bugs (I have found no bugs at all after 13 hours game play) Excellent game pacing Visually beautiful  Game Mechanics are amazing Tutorial misses a couple of things but you will figure them out yourself Customization of everything! You can even mess around with genetics though science or breeding Amazingly in depth without the need to micro manage You can re-create all of your favorite sci-fi shows in one game esentially a modders paradise Having frustraing moments in the game but upon writing this review I can't remember what they were.  THE BAD  Having a job Having a social life Family and kids The need to eat and sleep Basically anything that takes you away from playing this game 24/7  It has been many years probably decades in fact (showing my age) that a publishing house has developed (no pun intended) a reputation for being a provider of quality games. In my humble opinion games do a lot for us but in recent years they have dissapointed us in many ways it is so very refreshing to buy a game with confidence from a publishing house knowing its complete and that next week will not come with a game fixing patch or four add on packs for X amount of money.  AFTER 30 HOURS GAMEPLAY  So 40 planets later and over 300 pop the galaxy has taken shape. Time to expand my borders; time to check out ship design and combat which is if you watch it a lot more involved than the nay sayers would have you believe. It is more of an evloved rock paper scissors combat system in many ways. If your opponent favours missiles and heavy armor then you need to design ships with Point defence systems to take out their missiles and railguns to punch through that armor. I feared the worst when I had only a small fleet of 15 corvettes engage a group of larger heavily armed enemy ships but as i watched the battle hoping they could hold on until reinforcements arrived I saw the corvettes literally run rings around the larger ships evading the incoming fire and eventually destroying all enemy ships with only the loss of one of mine so there is more to combat than first meets the eye.  Annoying bugs mostly to do with the science exploration which is a shame as the precursor quest on this play through seems broken......looking forawrd to that patch.,1
Nice little free game. I recommend trying it,1
SUPERHOT is the most innovative game I've played in years!,1
"The game itself is pretty fun to play but has issues that almost made me give this game a negative review. The gameplay is pretty simple, you run around and kill enemies with your lightsaber or force powers.It is incredibly fun to just grab enemies and throw them into other enemies and that kind of thing. The difficulty of the game is...strange?The games difficulty is pretty hard to explain because it has a few difficulty spikes.Boss fights are one of them if you haven't figured them out.A lot of the time I just played through the levels like i was killing unarmed people just to face a boss at the end that killed me so many times.Each end of a boss fight is accompanied by annoying QTEs that aren't even hard.They are just there because.Failing the QTEs just forces you to start the QTE over again. The last area is a pain in the butt.The game spawns you in a big room filled with a ton of stormtroopers, 2 AT-STs 2 or 3 of those big guys and 2-3 snipers.Once you've killed them it spawns another bunch of stormtroopers and 3 or so big guys.You don't want to die because the game places the checkpoints at dumb positions.  If you really want to enjoy this game a lot, get yourself a trainer and turn on godmode.Makes the game so much less frustrating.",1

This game got boring pretty fast. I would not play it ever again.,-1
"This game is bad, this is bad end, this is not that batman we loved from previous games (not Origins ofc), I'm not talking about perfomance/bugs/lags/stuttreing/fps drops and etc. I'm talking about game, its just bad, slighty new combat moves, one new gadget one new predator takedown and ofc BATMOBILE which totally breaks whole batman universe, yes its very cool to remote control it, its fun to catapult from it, but this is batman, not freaking nfs or collin mc. i think 70% of time u will fight tanks, over and over, 20 tanks 30 tanks 50 tanks, no matter how many tanks, just every story part new tank combat, its so boring and annoying. And then boss fight, yea right tank boss fight. You will not fight any boss in this game by fists, gadgets or stealth. Remeber mr Freeze fight? this is one of the best boss i have ever seen in all games (except dark souls). So, in this batman nothing about it, Rocksteady rly? dont u have any idea except freaking tanks? Sometimes in story u will be really inspired but then tank fight or bat monstrosito, wtf?!$%#$. Riddles good, solving his rooms, puzzles (80% ofc with car), but then new checkpoint and batmobile laps..... Exploring Gotham? no way u need lower bridges first for freaking car ofc. Side quests? with car ofc. This game must be called 'Batman Arkham Batmobile' Joker's dead? Juts OMFG through whole game i heared only 2 voices, this is him and freaking some tank sentanse, like - we geeting hit, tango down, lose target.... I like joker, but this is too much, let him die already, hes not centre of all, again where your imagination, this is super heroes universe and u looping on joker, again, even after his death....Speaking about Origins i dont even know now which part is worst. I never write reviews, i dont care about thumbs. I'm just really upset, not about wasting time or money, i just want to clear my memory like in MIB and not see this game again, never, this is bad game, this is bad end, this is not that batman we loved",-1

"If you're looking for a true horror survival game, this is it. Gameplay, art style and score create a dark and frightening atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The only negative point is, that it's partially too long. Some of the missions seem unnecessarily prolonged and change the pace of the game where it shouldn't.",1
"The Walking Death game is a very good title game. Whenever you don't know how to play any skill based games, this is the game for you. If you like playing as a minority protagonist, then the Walking Death series is also for you. Spoilers are lee dies and you find kenny again in season 2 episode 2, but he is a crazy and sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In the Walking Death you can make choices that you may think affect you in the long run, but they really don't, similar to life. For example, in episode 4 even if you don't steal from jesus ♥♥♥♥ing arvo, you still get shot and found by the enemy team. This is not good. Everyone you meet in episode 1-3 dies, so good luck with relationships. Have fun playing this game because the story is so good and bad and vvery creativable.",1
  This game is so hard i could kill first boss when i have played 2 hrs. But this game is so cool .I like it:-),1

"Something doesn't feel right about this game, maybe it is stiff control of main character or perhaps that Bionic Commando lacks of atmosphere. It is just mediocre title with aspiration for being AAA action game. I don't recommend it, unless it is on sale then you might consider buying it.",-1

I can only imagine fat neckbeard weaboos playing this game and giving it positive ratings. There is no story. They're just anime cat girls that move their mouths and sway side to side so their boobs jiggle. Like there aren't even scenes like in anime. It's like watching someone with a cardboard cutout talking. This game has 0 play value.   It is just a game for creepy losers with weird fetishes to jerk off to. They look like 12 year old girls with boobs. Can you say pedo?   If you think this might be a good game because it has so many positive reviews, then you will be disapointed. I will be returning this boring softcore anime porno. It probably has no bad rating because the other 99% of sane people couldn't bare 5 minutes of this game to even be able to post a review.",-1
I'll give this game a fair rating with 7/10. Why you ask? For those of you that have played another indie title on the PS3 called 'Journey' this game is a lot like that in a sense that your givin the story with one character and your job is really nothing more than to explore. If you love games with vibrant color filled with loads of adventure than this game is for you.,1
Fun to play when you're bored. Pretty relaxed game. Great graphics.,1
I think it is a really cool product.,1
"Well then. I thought this game was gonna be crap. I'm not sure why. But then I played. Boy was I wrong. The gameplay, the story, the soundtrack. It all adds up to 1 of the best games ever. You owe yourself to play this game. Don't watch any videos of it. I did and i wish I never did. The game is best played without expectations or prior knowledge. So please do yourself a favour and get this game. You won't be dissapointed.",1

"Aw yeah. I finished this game in only 5 hours, but it was 5 hours well spent. I started and completed this two days after finishing Max Payne 1, and I think this game improves on the original in pretty much every way. The story of MP2 continues that of the first game and does a good job at keeping the player interested throughout the in-game conversations and comics that are presented after every 'chapter.' Backtracking is very minimal, the difficulty is well-balanced, and the overall pacing of the game is solid. Like the first game, there's heavy emphasis placed on shooting, so you'll probably enjoy this game if you're a decent shot. Otherwise, stop reading and go do something.",1
"Bone: The Great Cow Race is the sequal to Bone: From Out of Boneville game by Telltale Games. Based on the second volume of the said title, the game picks up where the last one left off. The Bone cousins are adjusting to their current lives in the valley they all ended up in after being chased down by the swarm of locusts. They have resided at the cottage that's occupied by a kind elderly woman named Grandma Ben &amp; her gorgous granddaughter Thorn. A spring fair was being held in the valley where the villagers and travellers from abroad gather together for import goods, carnival stands, and the yearly 'Great Cow Race'. Fone Bone who has a secret crush on Thorn will use the spring fair as an oppurtunity to express his love to Thorn. This attempt came to a halt when Thorn develops a relationship with a traveling beekeeper. Will Fone Bone be able to show Thorn how much she means to him is yet to be seen. Meanwhile Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone who are trying to pay their debt at the local pub run by the no-nonsense Lucius are crafting a scheme to get both of them out of debt. Phoney views the cow race as the oppurtunity to strike it rich and become the new owner of Lucius's pub in two swoops. Because Grandma Ben who is the only human contestant who par takes in the all bovine race is the popular choice to bet on. Phoney spreads rumors about Grandma Ben's health and claims to have a cow who is the fastest piece of beef in the whole valley. He goes all the way by making Grandma Ben appear to be ill and getting Smiley Bone to pose as a cow. Is this scam going to help Phoney's ambitions, or will it be as much of a failure as his Boneville election? This game is much more lengthy than the previous game as you play as all three Bone cousins each having a different story path that leads to one finale. There is the option to switch between the Bones in case you want to focus on a different cousin or if you feel stuck. The extra fair contenders weren't from the original comic volume, but they do feel like they originated from the Bone comics and helped made the game slightly longer than the predessor did. Keep in mind that this game wasn't intended as the last Bone game as it was open for a third game that was going to be based on the third volume 'Eye of the Storm'. The game in question never went into development and Telltale never went on record for the reason. Either due to low sales on the game or a falling out with Bone's creator Jeff Smith. But 10 years since this game's release, Telltale never went back to the Bone series for more games. A real shame too cause the good stuff in the comic series happens in volume 3, as it further develops the relationship between Fone Bone &amp; Thorn, many secrets are revealed including the identity of the mysterious Hooded One of the Locusts. I can totally see all of the Bone comic volumes as episodic adventure games. But with the unlikelihood of more Bone games all we have is the anticipated animated film trilogy that's been in development for years. If it does officially get off the ground, I can see it being on par with the two Bone games which is all we have for now as a Bone related media. So if you have finished this game and are craving to know the rest of the story, read the comic series. It is a creative and wonderful comic series that will delight generations of readers to come. It will be the comic series I will read to my future kids some day as well.",1

"This game is pleasant to look at and enjoyable to play. It gets the difficultly right without being confronting. The levels are cleverly designed with the game set high in the sky. You rarely get led up the garden path and if you do its for a good reason. While players aren't provided much guidance, intuition should kick in. For example, I just knew there had to be hidden secrets. The lack of attaining a corresponding achievement after completing the first world confirmed my suspicions.  The art direction is understated. Ambient music only plays on the occasion. The lighting is effective and varies for each level. The sporadic plant-life spruces up the spartan levels nicely while the background clouds are gorgeous. Its easy to recommended this game. 7.5/10",1
"Really amazing game!! I rate 11/11 cores Not too hard to play through after you got the hang of it, and after the first playthrough its still worth going for the achievements of wich some are really hard! I really recommend this game!",1
"Just an everyday 3rd person, brown, cover shooter...right? Yes and no.  This game is dark and deep. It will make you think and feel. I think everyone should try it at least once, there's a very unique experience to be had here... .... even though it wears the skin of mediocrity.",1
"A little slow at first, but once you get your first few blueprints for new ships, the amount of customziation you can do is amazing!  Fun top-down space shooter, a blend of space invaders, battletech, and Duke Nukem [the humor]. The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft &amp; tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.  Well worth the price.",1
this game is a classic...amazing music and great memories playing this game on dreamcast and ps2.the pc version is so much better than both.this is a great game and worth even a few minutes of play time just for the memories.,1
Just Yes,1
Be the Bat-mobile.,-1
Excellent rouge-like with many secrets and a dark tale. 10/10,1
is glichy as hell with out an xbox controller   it was so bad i even uninstalled,-1
ya know you can get this free when it was december 2013 lol 10/10,1
Can't even get past matchmaking to play a game.,-1
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM! 100% does not work. Crashes after character creation just like every other person. Tried hotfixes and they do not work. Do not buy this. Absolutely ridiculous that Steam allows this to be bought but it doesn't run for a majority of users. Wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing it. I would like my money back.,-1
"Awesome game. An original take on classical dungeon-crawling games. Not particularly fun at two, but still a very enjoyable additional feature. If you read the description on the store page and is intrigued/interested, then go for it: you won't be disappointed. It's exactly what it looks like.",1
"  I got this game for free, but that in no way influences this review",1
HL2 should be played by every serious fan of FPS games. I spent many weeks playing the game one Christmas holiday and enjoyed the well crafted game throughout the whole story. Very impressive title and still stands the test of time now.,1
"as a pool game this is good but its a bit fake and how come a pool game needed 8gb ram??!! my computer is lag and i can't even aim properly not that i don't how to play, i played every pool game i ever play but this is just a dissapointment",-1
"Continues on quite well from its predecessors. The previous GalCiv 1 and 2 would tend to crash quite often, no such issues with this release",1
Great graphics... ❤,1
"I like this game. It felt like a Tell Tale game, but it also felt more like a challenge during the Quick Time Event Combat. Characters were okay, with some strange growth to them, but I liked it. This story plays out during the first movie, so it was a nice tie-in.  Achievement Quest: This was fun to go for. Not as easy as the other achivements for the Tell Tale games stories.",1
"great game, crytech was onece up on a time a good company.",1
Too often it felt like work instead of fun.,-1
"I am enjoying it. The only thing bothering me about this game is that it crashed when I try to log in through steam, so it is not logging my hours (i have more than just the 2 hours). But other than the crashes this game is just beautiful to explore.",1
LOVE THIS GAME. SO FUTURISTIC,1
"An honest opinion of this game.  Upon the game, You are greeted with a message which tells you you only have one life in this game. I have no problem with this feature, if only it actually worked. Death is a very hard thing to achieve in this game. The closest you can get to death is a bloody screen and the word 'Dead' on your O2 meter.  Graphics are not overly bad in this game. I only have a standard quality graphics card and it ran smoothly on it. The wallpaper that is meant to be space is rather inacurate. The size of some of the satelites would mean that they had been somehow frozen in time as they fell towards the Moon (unlike the unrealistic amount of generic meteorites only capable of making you blead out of your face). The walking animation is just... interesting. It seems as though you are attempting to take the longest strides you possibly can in an attempt to walk the 3 miles a bit faster.  The objective of the moon map (as issued by a 10 year old sounding boy/girl) is to locate other team members before your oxygen runs out. There are too many issues with this objective. You don't find team members, you find small metal flashing objects laying on the floor. These objects cannot be activated and 4/5 of them cannot even be reached. Invisible walls stop you from reaching most of the objectives. Meaning you just spent 20-30 minutes walking towards a piece of metal and a wall.  10 minutes after my O2 meter started reading 'Dead', the meteorites stopped hitting the ground. Instead they just despawned in the sky above me. Unfortunately for me, this was when I was contemplating running into the meteorites in order to attempt to kill myself and end it all. I decided to head back to the crash site and wait for the game to just kill me. In the end, I just quit of boredom.  If you plan on confirming the functionality of your 'w' key or your steam uninstall feature then this is a good game for you!",-1
"A player who said BIAS on soviet, YOU ARE NOOB I played with german tank I can kill soviet tank just 1 shot or u just ex player from WoT",1
This was fun for about a week but it doesn't have much to offer. Pretty much the same thing each level.,-1
You get shot more then you shoot. 10/10 would accidently blind my teammates and get blasted by my teammate's grenade again.,1
Perfect if you wanna scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone.,1
Way cheaper than therapy.,1
"Now we have release and it has already far exceeded my expectations (which were good) from BETA. Get a group of four mates together and your experience will be expanded. However, also play very well with a smaller number or solo. Multiplayer with mates on comms 10/10 top top game.  The dialogue and atmosphere are spot on. You find yoursleves having a good chuckle despite the end of the world theme.   Gameplay is challenging which is pot on. It has it's share of those moments - damn a horde, oh ♥♥♥♥ now there are armoured skaven, oh f##k now there be a rat ogre. Overall thos moments are fantastic as they continually cause you to be fighting for survival which is the whole point. Dificulty is spot on - well done and don't change it. The fighting is spot on to. I love it when you get that weapon that just seems to sing in your hand (no rude comments please - I said sing not sting) and when you get a few more you struggle to pick the one you want to take with you and wish you could take more........ well done on the weapons the act and feel different and you can vary your gameplay accordingly.  Yes I am a big fan of this game, well worth the dosh!",1
One Sexy Beast of a Game &lt;3 I like my PayDay,1
Fun to do by your self or with friends. Its a well made World War II RTS.,1
"I used to play this game in and just after college. At the time it was a fatastic game with well above average visuals. The gameplay is still there but the visuals are somewhat lacking these days, but no matter its still well worth the few bucks it costs on steam.",1
The game and music make this an awesome game that you can play for hours!,1
Having tested since first wave alpha the game has progressed well.  Anyone looking for a 40k fix will enjoy the depth and detail. Some light MMO elements in progression coupled with fun melee and a decent range combat feel.   More to come as the game grows but so far so good....oh and free to play Orks :D   ,1
"Characters were lacking, storyline felt shallow, poor colour palette, 9.6/10 -IGN",1
This game is good but its missing something. I want the devs of this game to go back and blaze like 10 pounds of weed and remake it for that extra f*cking minecraft hardcore letsplay feel.,1
"This is purely a matter of taste.   Do you like those simple, almost pedantically hard platformers of yesteryear? If yes, then you will probably like this game.  But if, like me, you're not really a of fan of those and were hoping that this was one of those modern puzzle platformers with stories you can be invested in and/or more cerebral gameplay mechanics (such as Braid, Thomas Was Alone, or FEZ), then you should be aware that that's not what this game is.  The game's main charms are the quite wonderful art style and the neat gimmick of being able to shift between worlds... But if you're not enjoying the gameplay much, these charms will wear thin pretty quick. This game has no real story and its gameplay really doesn't consist of much more than a series of well-timed jumps and collecting gems. Even the world-shifting gimmick ultimately does not seem to do much beyond making certain platforms appear or disappear. Checkpoints seem sparse, and after having to go back and redo half the level many times due to missing some unforgiving jumps (and being unable to save during a level), I realized that this game was just not for me.   There's no doubt that this is a well-made game. But it just isn't for everyone. Get this game if you feel a lot of nostalgia towards the late '80s or early '90s when platformers were hard but simple. Otherwise, give it a pass.",-1
Great game if you actually take the time to give it a real go.,1
"Pixel Puzzles: Japan had it's issues, which were not addressed in this game. Namely the fact that all the pieces are floating in a pool, and if two or more pieces are floating around, the game seems to choose from a specific order which one you pick up. If your like me and you prefer to do the border of the puzzle first, this may help with the top border, but the lower half becomes a hassle due to this mechanic.  On top of this issue, they added zombies to make this game even more annoying. You can thankfully do puzzles without the zombies, but there is another issue. Some of these puzzles are just graphic, including one of what seems to be a female zombie giving birth to a baby zombie.  I can not recommend this game to anybody but a hardcore zombie fan, and somebody who likes doing puzzles as well.  And yes, I am fully aware that I've only done maybe 25 minutes of this game. That was enough for one puzzle, with zombies, and going through the extras to see all the pics used for puzzles.",-1
"This game is awesome. This is one of the few games I've found that give that sense of existential horror. Not the 'jumpy-scary, monster's gonna getcha' kind of horror. This is 'what was that, what is this, what the ****ing **** is going on, please make it stop I want to go home' grade stuff. I'm afraid that I couldn't say much more without spoiling anything.   The graphic style and sound do a great job of selling the whole experience. The writing is likewise amazing - the two main characters have developed personalities, and their dialogue is wholly believable and natural. I do have one significant complaint about the narrative, but again, I won't spoil it.  It probably needs to be said that this game's foundation is planted firmly in atmosphere. If you need to run-and-gun and can't stop to appreciate the scenery, then it isn't for you. If you take in your surroundings and get the full effect while you explore, it will be a treat.",1
"I bought the three game bundle the other day and I am so in love with Bioshock! It has a small feeling of fear, like not knowing what will be around the corner even if it ends up being a splicer. It has gore but that just adds to the creepyness of what has happenned in Rapture. You gotta play this. New favorite game. Whoop Whoop",1
"Scribblenauts Unlimited is a nice game, but I only just reccomend it. Only purchase this game if it is on sale, because it becomes boring and repetitive relatively quickly. The art stlye is appealing and the music is good.",1
"Pros: Bowling GTA Mods Guns Violence Guns and Violence Bowling  Cons: Runs worse then Windows 98. You need a Windows live account to do anything (saving, playing online) Max 25 FPS Lots of bugs that Rockstar doesnt bother to fix (Probably there too busy with GTA 5) Poorly Optimized for a PC.  Conclusion: 4/10 would go bowling again.",-1
Awesome game! I love it,1
i reccomend you this game,1
Pros: + well...it's a Tomb Raider game + Stealth and Hunting is kinda nice + Exploring Tombs is fun + Background story is kinda interessting but...  Negative: - ... the story is told in a super boring way. I just don't care at all what happened. The Audio Books about the past where the small bits I actually wanted to listen to - If you have AMD gpu prepare for lags and frame drops - way too many escape 'run girl run' moments. Those are not fun! - I feel in the last game the movement was better  Recommend only for Tomb Raider Fans. The rest should wait for it to get cheaper or just skip it. You won't miss anything.,-1
great game. muchh swag.,1
"Made some meth with instructions from the internet, wasn't blue tho.",1

Pretty cool game. All the violence rocks. Love it.,1
"20/10 best game, Seriously I give this to my friends all the time...............    Explains why I dont have any    But the game is pretty good I highly recomend for it's superb soundtrack, great phsyics/engine. Your basic goal is to kill the cat man, I know it's a rip off of Gotham imposters but with cats and rats , But this does what that game dosen't do and more. Such as the characters are actually realy relateable you got terrorist rat    A little edgey but you can relate    You got The Batter, if you want to learn more about him he got his own game called OFF. I could go on and on why you should get this game. but, Ultimately it's up to you.",1
"I really liked this game. The gameplay overall was good, however it got a little sideways when playing as the alien. The only other downside was how short it was.",1
"  Fun game, really enjoy the work that Valve always seems to perfect. Great mod support to keep this old game running, and great to enjoy even in 2017.",1
"It's a pretty good puzzle game. The story is catching with a very few 'too real' scenes thrown in. It isn't Life is Strange or Undertale, and you probably won't walk away with a new outlook on WW1. I liked playing it. If you end up playing it and liking it you should try reading Fall of Giants by Ken Follet. It's the best Fictionalization of WW1.",1
"I loved the first game.  While I've neglected to play this one out, It felt like a true sequel. Good times, good co-op.  Text to Speech is back as an option",1
the side games should also be played  http://kentuckyroutezero.com/limits-and-demonstrations/   http://kentuckyroutezero.com/the-entertainment/ ,1
"MUCH better than Civ 5 vanilla. Seems most of the complaints are coming from those that only played 5 with all DLC + mods. The AI is still to this day horrible in that game, and will continue to be that way until unit stacks return.   This feels so much better than vanilla 5, where the game was basically an upgraded Civ Rev (console game) until DLC filled it out. You don't get the 'I'm playing a mobile game' effect that was had moving to 5 from Beyond the Sword. There's 100% more content than I honestly expected.  That said, there's definite room for improvement and this recommendation is for Civ fanatics only. For everyone else, just wait a couple of years for the DLC and Complete editions to roll out. By then, the major problems like pacing (the tech tree just zooms too quickly bc of the new boost mechanic) should be fixed if only by addition of more content. To anyone else expecting great AI to appear at some point, it's not going to happen until stacks of doom come back.",1
"The most intruiging game I have played where player choices actually matter. Predecessor of the original Fable comics (which I suggest reading), this game does justice to the fantasy world created by Bill Willingham.",1
A great game to just play and relax.,1
"I started to play this game when Steam offers for only RM5 (Malaysia Money), that's like a dollar and 25 cents here.  I have no complain whether I'm on both Human and Dinosaur team, because you get to experience a lot of characters and their special abilities.  And especially, you BE the T-REX or DON'T GET EATEN ALIVE!  This game is realllyyy good! Money well spent~",1
"These Artifex Mundi HOGs are the gaming equivalent of comfort food. When I fire one up I know exactly what to expect and I can mindlessly click through them as a way to wind down after work. After the eleven billionth title I've started to get sick of seeing the same puzzles: the concentric rings, the recipe for a potion, the safe combination, and so forth. I want Artifex Mundi to take a few risks and try something a bit different.  Although  Mind Snares  follows the formula pretty closely, it does take a few risks by abandoning the usual supernatural theme in favour of a psychological inner journey. And instead of the usual abandoned child that needs saving, Alice is saving office workers from their demeaning jobs. So big ups for trying something a bit different.",1
"Decently interesting puzzle game, but the difficulty lies mostly in that it doesn't explain anything and the visual style sometimes obscuring solutions. Once you figure it out there's at most a handful of levels that provide a challenge.",1
This game is awesome. Just...just play it already.,1
"Honestly not sure if I ever liked this game or not, but it is strangely addictive. The scantily clad ladies (and supposed nude mod) was the original draw, but the more I played, the more I strove to get further and further into the game. Unfortunately, the latest update has really turned this game on it's head... and not in a good way. The only thing in the latest update that I actually like is the stats they list, and those are pretty slim. Once upon a time I would have almost recommended this game as a guilty pleasure for people who are anal compulsive. Now I don't recommend it to anyone.",-1
"Agar.io with slightly better looks and small packets of pay to win that get unlocked as you 'level'. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Agar.io and I can see some potential and I like some of the content introduced, but it has just worsened a problem I had with the original Agar.io, which is that the momment you join a game already in progress you are at a large disadvantage. Some of the items in this new version now ensures that if you join a new game as a new player you can still encounter this disadvantage because experienced players are often bigger and faster when they first join or respawn.  An interesting game, but I don't think this varient is worth my time. If you enjoy grinding with some interesting competative gameplay, give this one a shot, I'm sure once you get to explore all the items at higher levels this is probably a decent game. But it's not for me.",-1
Combat system almost feel like Fairy Fencer F. I like it.,1
this game is amazing.i cant stop playing it ,1

"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ATHEISTS since drudging through this lackluster, 5-hour adventure is a painful reminder that ridding Europe of Nazi occupation does not answer the question of our mortality in a contingent universe or why any of this will have mattered once we are all dead.",-1

"One of my favorite games I have played over the last few years. I played it through once and it was challenging but not too difficult. After finishing, I immediately began a second play though. I have played hundreds of hours of this game and have enjoyed every minute. Great buy!",1
"I wanted to like this game. I'd also like to, at some point, play this game. So far it can't play without crashing to desktop.",-1
"I'm loving it so far, but it's not for everyone. This game is relaxing and interesting at the same time and keeps me interested with many things to explore. I haven't had any issues as of yet and the game is running smooth as silk, maybe a couple of drops depending on the situation but I'd say 99% good above 60.  I'm running 4K 60-70fps pretty constant with textures on high, shadows on high, 4x AF, FXAA with specs: i7-6700k @stock 4.0Ghz GTX 1080 Gigabyte G1 Gaming @1975Mhz (latest drivers) 8gb ram Non-SSD Win 10  If you want an exploration space game with minor elements of combat, galactic trading and just general discoveries. It's for you. If you're expecting a fallout 4 style open world game, this is not it.",1
"This game is Amazing and Difficult, at the same time",1
"I love adult swim, I love almost all of adult swim's games, however I don't like this.  I played the hell out of Major Mayhem on mobile. The PC version just seems bland and boring. It's fun nonetheless, but it just seems like it's lacking. If you want to obtain a copy of this game, just get the mobile version. It just feels so much smoother and the gameplay seems fitting. On PC the gameplay just seems dull, extremely repetitive, and terribly slow. It's not a bad game, it just doesn't seem like this was meant for PC at all.",-1
"Risk of Rain is a game you will try and fail in. Then try again and get a little further. Then try once more and get not quite as far as the first. There's a lot of elements to this game that are random. The biggest of which is the item drops. The quality of the items, the rarity and quantity are randomly generated. That not only makes Risk of Rain feel random, but also makes it challenging. For some reason I'll get further and last longer with worse items. Makes me think I'm on my game! The randomness can feel frustrating or unfair at times, but it adds major replayability.  There are a lot of pros and cons, but just know... Risk of Rain is a fantastic game. There are different characters you play as and unlock. You also unlock droppable items through achievements and tasks. The characters all play incredibly different. I believe there's 10 different options. In the game you'll spend the majority of your time dodging and platforming - trying to trick the AI into not being able to get to you. The difficulty also ramps up for every 5 minutes you play (up to 60mins). So ideally you'll clear the level, get all the items and kill the boss all in one sweep. That's usually not the case, since you have to kill enemies to gain money to unlock a chest.  A major flaw I've seen is the multiplayer. It has huge potential for a fun multiplayer experience but they missed it just a bit. You can play with 4 players in one screen. That screen does not get split. You must travel CLOSELY with your companions. I'm uncertain if online multiplayer allows you to split off. That's not the flaw, however. The upgrades are how you get more powerful. Only one person can pick up the upgrade, and upgrades are not shared. So you can either choose to split the upgrades between you and your buddy/ies and all be weaker, or have one person pick up every upgrade and have the others feel useless. This can also add some tactical measures to the game as well. If you know the upgrades well enough, you can give the ideal upgrades to the different classes and maybe be stronger as a unit then you would be with one godinator and 3 scrubby nubbies.  I'm tempted to say this game is ALMOST too challenging, but it wouldn't feel like an accomplishment if it were easy to make it to the end, now would it? I've played maybe 30-40 runs and completed once or twice. Damn it felt good when I beat it.   Play this game. Beat it with every class. Be my hero.",1
"My favorite of the Dead Space series. Scary, action-ny, and a good story line, much better than the first. Will keep you addicted til the very end.",1

you like walking through a hopsital hallway thats on fire while mutated gollums ripe apart ATC soldiers to the point where theres not a whole body left and a psycho ♥♥♥♥♥ that your gonna be in a relationship with but its complicated is trying to kill you then get this game. 10/10 alot i mean alot of gore,1

"I got into Terraria a couple years back post-Minecraft craze era (never played Minecraft) - and this 2D platformer with RPG style bosses and adventure mixed with mining and crafting really hit a sweet spot somewhere and I sank hours upon hours into it.  After it's release on X-Box One some of my friends have gotten into this game again and I noticed significant changes to the game world, backgrounds, more crafting items and vanity items. I re-installed and cracked it out again. You can sink epic amounts of hours into this game - I play solo but I hear multiplayer is awesome.  Beautifully thought out game that you can sink your teeth into and still feel like there is so much more to see and do.",1
"Very peaceful and realaxing, yet somewhat challenging at the same time",1
Its ok i guess. it could just go on a website or something. but i like the fact it is on steam. Also i dont know why i cant get lemons anymore. they stop produceing!  Sounds wierd but its true. Overall good game.,1
I'v played games that are: - far more polished - with better textures and graphics - with more varied ennemies - bigger map - more weapons and classes - a good storyline ......... but why can't i stop when i play this game? why? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?,1
Awesome game. Multiplayer is a tonne of fun.,1
Never goes out of style with the craziness....,1

  Great game I really enjoy it I ve woud reccomend this game to everyone. Try it now while it s free :) I love this game.,1
This is a top down shooter that everyone should have. This game will make you rage and you'll fall in love with it.   How you ask?  One word:- Soundtrack.,1
"Really happy with the game so far. The AI put up a good challenge, I'm having some real battles. Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays. The most complete Motorcross game available. progressive career, lots of bike upgrades and gear options.   I have played EVERY motorcross game since excitebike on nintendo. This is a solid MX game 8/10",1

"When I first got a Playstation 3 this was one of the 1st games I got, and even til today this is my favorite game that I've ever played. This game is the most fun I've had on a racer, and there's just so much content in here, with races, stunt runs, marked man races, the Road Rages, plus all the unlockable cars.  The only negative I have, is that it appears that the 'Ultimate Box' does not include all the DLC that was available on the Ps3, namely the expansion 'Big Surf Island' or the Cops/Robbers pack. I don't know if the Legendary Cars are included either. If not, I'm very disappointed in that, as I thought this 'Ultimate Box' would actually have everything in it.  I got this in a Humble Bundle, so I can't be too upset, plus it IS my favorite game ever, so I'm good. Would just have loved to have Big Surf Island, as I love the Dune Buggy car.  This is HIGHLY recommended. So much fun, and this is one of the few games I'll play online.",1
"A rock-solid co-op experience. Playing as the Infected in Versus mode is practically sanctioned griefing of other players. In those perfect-storm moments where the team works together, it's some of the best multiplayer around.

"Must have for those who are looking for a game to play with a friend over the network. Long, interesting and visually attractive coop shooter with pretty simple but not annoying puzzles, variety of mechanics and beautiful cut scenes. Different weapons, different types of monsters with different strategies to fight against them. You can even enable an option to let other players all over the world to join your game as zombies (like in dying light). Haven't seen any bugs or glitches so far. The only shortcoming in my opinion is the console origin of the game, camera is not always perfect (but at least there are options to make it slightly better in the main, not in-game menu) and controls are not the same as usually used in thrid-person actions on PC. Other than that it is a great game.",1
"Tyranny is great game - somewhere between Pillars of Eternity and Baldur's Gate. And BG is the highest top...so you know. Pros: Story, decision branching, characters, combo moves, spell making, combat and also lovely design, graphic and soundtrack. Cons: Lenght - 28 hours...I expected more. Difficulty - Normal is too easy from half of the game. I will definitely play on hard next time. I didn't got to explore 1 whole area (Burning library) - it was inaccessible all the time. Maybe because of my decisions or I missed the short opportunity to get here. I really have no idea and I am little dissapointed.",1

"Well, Rockstar Games screwed up by letting Bill Gates in on a good Franchise. Way to go! Steam is selling a game that doesnt even run. So Steam can remove this from their store and re imburse me for my loss.",-1
Very nice game for adventurers,1
This is one of the very best games in video game history. I played it in my childhood and now played it again after 20 years or so. Still remembered all the the things and managed to get from start to end in under 5 houres. Usually - if you are new to this game - you probably need more than 40 houres playtime to get to the end. Btw. there are also possibilities of playing the old 1993 version of the game via Dosbox or ScummVM. But: those few Euros it costs on steam are completely worth this new version of the game. It has very pretty reworked graphics not giving up the original style.,1
i have played 15 minutes i will never get past that,1
"This game is adicting. You start small , by yourself, in a garrage, then expand to become bigger and bigger, and hiering other staffmembers. You develop games and gameengines with new tecnologi, and I don't have time for more. Need to get back to play the game.",1
"wonderful game, one the best multiplayer experience available",1
This game is a lot of fun and very easy to sink a lot of time into.,1
"Great game,loved the missions!",1
Loved it. Great fun. Bring more pants though.,1
"Very good space combat simulation game. Story is ok, graphics is mostly average (you need just average PC to run everything maxed out), music is excellent, and gameplay is challenging. There are 'only' 13 levels, but they still offer more hours of play than many overpriced AAA games.  Game was not good at release. You couldn't change difficulty and checkpoint system was completely terrible. They fixed it and now it works perfectly.  If you are huge fan of mecha anime (like me :-D), buy it. Models are Macross inspired. If it only had G mode so you could glide in the capital ships like Rick Hunter on the Zentraedi capital ships... Story is the copy of classical Gundam story - there is a war between Earth and colonies, and the main weapon which will change war is Gundam, I mean Strike Suit. I'm perfectly fine with it.",1
"Where to start... The game is fine! Cool story,fun gameplay but the whole game is really short (even with the holiday levels).Also my game had a glitch that the screen would freeze and only sound was playing but it is easy to solve i guess.... Do i recommend this game to buy?Yes, only if you really want to support pewds and Outerminds.",1

"If you liked XCom Enemy Unknown then you'll love this game. It takes most of the elements from the first game, and improves upon them. Liked making one of your soldiers into your bf/gf then agonizing every time an enemy takes a shot at them. Well good news, you can do that better with a small UFO full of new options, and the ability to save your characters so they appear in multiple games. The classes have received a load of improvements making them much deadlier, like the gunslinger sharpshooter who can take a number of shots in a turn, or the heavy gunner grenadier who can shred through thickly armored targets. Equipment is also stronger and more varied, with many new grenade, ammo, and 'vests' to create. Plus a little tip, mimic beacon can sometimes give you a whole free turn. Unfortunately XCom isn't the only group that got some upgrades. I really do feel like the devs sat around and thought 'how can we make the enemies even more over powered'. With all the new random elements introduced (random grenades, ammo drops, starting locations, levels, ect) This game can be fun for multiple playthroughs.",1
"I have to admit the game started out rough on launch, but the game is a decent open world first person game in the same vein as Far Cry and Crysis. You have to temporarily suspend your disbelieve of the story. It would have been far more plausible if it were russians, chinese or even the british. But the north koreans seem abit far fetched to be honest. THe gameplay on the other hand took inspiration from Far Cry and made the theme work. Driving the motorcycle and rc car bombs is incredibly over sensitive, which makes maneuvering them a chore, and the gun play seems average at best. Stealth works fine and the world do make the game interesting. The game do occasionally have it's bugs but none of them I have encountered through my playthrough I would say, game breaking. In it's current state I would say the game is far from perfect, but neither is it a turd. It's an average game with alot of decent mechanics. I would say, give the game a chance if you like open world in the same vein as far cry.",1
"grinding is hell but its pretty fun to play with your friends plus a bonus, inside jokes duh!",1
I paid $20.00 for this game and then they release it for free. No bonuses for the purchase either. It is now a pay to play basically. The gameplay is almost unbearable. When playing its just a cycle of being spawn trapped by either grenades or airstrikes from the enemy team. There is also only like 3 Australian servers so if you live in Australia don't buy this.  Uninstall/10,-1
i'll be honest.. this is by far one of the greatest game i've ever played! So much fun! Just one downside.. cant play with friends!!!!,1

"Came from D3 since there's not much to do anymore in D3 after ~1300h. After some help from the -very kind- community I finally got in the PoE semi-end game. The game is a lot of fun, mostly because you can adjust 'any' skill gem into a build. You build your skill tree around that, you support that skill gem with other gems and you're good to go. So if you're getting into this, try to get some help through reddit/discord/youtube/guilds to learn the do and don't of PoE.",1

"A great game,have buckets worth of hours on it when I played Xbox,but the game is definitely the most fun when playing with friends. The PC Port runs terribly, I run Witcher 3 60fps on medium settings and I get frame rate drops on here. Worst of all, I can't play with my friends because the online is broken. Rampant slowdown and forums with the devs dodging questions and blaming people's hardware are all I've been able to experience. The slowdown is NOT fps related,its just the game slowing down the game to may be a quarter of the intended speed for no actual reason, and none of the suggestions fix the problem. Idk about couch coop,but this is just a poor online experience. Cannot recommend with these problems in the game. Still somewhat fun by yourself,though.",-1

"This is a good, solid and sometimes fun game. But there are requirements to that fun.   Requirements for the game to be fun    Friends to play with   Opposing team in your skill range   As the pool of players flux, the skill level will have to be higher to have any fun with the remaining community. I've had a good run with friends for a while, every now and then, but upon reflection: I won't recommend this game at full price ($30 AUD - Australian conversion is a killer)  with the quickly dwindling player base,  but on sale, might be worth a purchase.  I do commend them on their constant updates/maps, and fair DLC which is restricted just to costmetics.  *Fair comment made by Jon, I might have to play more ranked matchs to get better matched games. For the Australian market, it is closer to $30 AUD for the game and I still think that is steep price to pay.",1

"Fantastic game, I strongly reccomend you purchase the expansion packs however. The game feels incomplete without them.",1
Awsome game :D,1
"Really interesting idle game. If you idle you make some progress but if you want to get far you actually have to waste a lot of time managing your resources which is quite contradictory. Time spent on this game is also a resource. Should I rebirth now or leave it for another day?  But you can still go and read some chinese xianxia web novels about cultivation while waiting, they are both quite similar ^.^",1
"Absolutely terrible game and a very bad xbox port - controls are hard to learn, very bad resolution and refresh rate.",-1
"if you want to be good and useful in this game, you need to pay to win. grenades? DLC. good melee weapons? DLC. sniper rifles? DLC. light machine guns bar from 1? DLC. grenade launchers, miniguns and rocket launchers? DLC. useful perk decks (like grinder and burglar)? DLC. everything that should be a core element of the game is paywalled  if you're a new player, this can be very daunting, as you just coughed up £15 to play the game in the first place, and then you need to cough up a further £30+ for the ridiculous amount of DLC to actually get the full ♥♥♥♥ing experience. and now they've had the nerve to add microtransactions, making the entire situation worse. not only does payday 2 have weapon skins, you need to find a safe to get a weapon skin, and either get a very very rare drop of a drill (forgetting that the RNG probably hates you), or purchase one off the market. on top of this, skins also provide a slight advantage, with some skins providing EXP boosts.  honestly, whatever the game was before, it's wrecked now. just go play something else that doesn't paywall necessary parts of the game",-1
" In a nutshell:  Nice little game. A few level design hangups, but otherwise it's a fun distraction. Format is very similar to the  12 Labours of Hercules  or  MOAI  series, with a difficulty somewhere between the two. Requires more strategy than 12 Labours, but not edge-of-your-seat frantic like MOAI. Easy to 100%.   Gameplay",1

"Don't bother spending money on just a graphics upgrade. If you own the original, stick with it.",-1
"Lovecraftian horror written by Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw presented as an interesting mix of multiple choice elements and 2D sections. Calling this a 'roguelike' would be missing the point, but it does borrow a few mechanics from that genre. The graphics are minimal, but suit the atmosphere of the game very well. The music is creepy enough to create goosebumps in the right moments. Of course the best bits are Yathzee's story fragments and the way that random encounters are implemented. After playing it twice I can see that the game offers a lot of things to discover.  A well made game that has a lot to offer especially if you like Lovecraft and/or Yahtzee, but I would really recommend it to anyone that likes well made horror games.",1

"I gave this game a try despite the price tag of 25 euro, and now almost 10 hours later i came to the conclusion that i didn't really waste my money. It didn't blew me away in any way, but it was a good experience. It's an anime-action-fighting game in an open world that involves a lot of dialogue and QTE's. The game is as i understand it - Ported from consoles and is locked at 30 fps. And don't worry, - It doesn't matter in a game like this. But the textures aren't that great. They are actually very poor, and characters will pop in even when you are not that far from them. See for yourself in the video below. It's a very short video without any spoilers. I still recommend the game. But you might wait for an discount          YouTube™ Video:  Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed - Walkthrough - Part 7&nbsp;",1

Controls were bad :p,-1
"This game is a good buy but I'd defenitly wait to buy it till you catch it on sale. Its a great strategy game and the space aspect of it is amazing. YOu always have this unsafe feeling when playing because at any moment your planet could be 'Annihilated.' A downside to this game would be that whoever can reach the metal planet and build what I refer to as, 'The Death Star' which is basically that, its a giant laser you can build that destroys any planet you choose. They arestill updating the game and it has some bugs that need worked out but I'd recommend it.",1

This game is awesome because it contains a story and great life experience. It's fun and sexy If you know what I mean :),1
A game from the creators of the Max Payne games. Remedy has taken the style of narration to the next level. Having the main character be a writer let them have a large amount of creative room and they made the most of it. You play as the writer Alan Wake who is taking a vacation in hopes of helping with his writers block but falls into his own narrative. -TurdSnack 10/10,1
"I love Dungeon Keeper games but I don't love this. It's set together pretty poorly with a bad story and immense lag issues, or RAM issues, rather. During loading and during some of the later campaign maps it took 5-10 minutes for it to load, during this time the computer being completely unavailable, since WFTO is leeching all RAM, making it nearly impossible to even open up a new tab on Firefox. Furthermore, on the later campaign maps there would be constant small lagspikes making it very hard to properly manage the battles and what not. Many other minor problems here and there as well, lacking names and structures in rooms actually having 'Prop' before it's name...",-1
Saints Row IV is a marvellously enjoyable game,1
Definatly worth it,1
"A simple game with simple mechanics, (or are they?...) Switch between Black and white, and absorb the same colour enemy fire as your ship, throw in a crap load of stuff on the screen at the same time, and you've got yourself a game of concentration, just be sure not to rage to hard when you game over. (You can change the option settings to infinite continues, just in case you hate 'arcade - style')",1
"The launch of this game wasn't perfect on PC, but fixes are well underway (incremental patches) and the game itself is absolutely perfect. Building on an already amazing foundation laid down by Dishonored, the sequel delivers much more of everything that was introduced in the first game: a moving story, two different characters, many different ways to traverse the game's beautiful surroundings and many different of getting things done - which affect the world around you in a very palpable and often unexpected fashion. I almost never play single player games more than once, and I am currently on my third playthrough and planning a fourth, because I am finding something new every single time - and I don't mean a hidden area or two; I mean events that change an entire level in a multitude of ways (hint: Aramis Stilton).",1
"This is one of those simple games that I cannot stop playing. It's just the right level of difficult: It may take a few tries to beat a level, but I'm not ripping my hair out with frustration. I'm also willing to replay levels immediately after completing them in order to get a better score because I feel capable of achieving the goal times; they aren't unrealistic amounts.  The art style is simple and cute. It reminds me of pokemon and others bits of my childhood. When I'm not trying to cut down on my time, I like messing with the environment, mostly destroying dandelions. I feel like there should be an achievement for destroying x amount of dandelions. The first time I died, I laughed at the explosion animation; it was perfect. I also enjoy the sound effects.  Overall, this a a perfect not-too-hard, not-too-easy game. I can keep track of time with the 'shadow' of my previous play. The countdown doesn't start until I press a key, so I have time to strategize. I highly recommend this game.",1
"A dark and fitting finale to the trilogy, Max Payne 3 shows you what becomes of Max after he has completely lost everything. Years down the road, you see him, drunk, and lost. Still popping pills, and surviving if his life could be considered survival. Now a bodyguard for a wealthy family, trouble finds him again.   One final shot at redemption is what he has left, and yet everything seems to be spiraling out of control. Does it work out for him? Does he live? Does he find his redemption? I won't say. I will strongly recommend this though. Whether you play it here on Steam or on a console, def pick this up if you are a fan of Max Payne. You won't be disappointed. The story is excellent, as is the gameplay.   What happens when a man has fallen as far as he can fall? What happens when he has nothing left to lose? Is there redemption for someone so broken?  Play it and find out. Totally worth it!   5/5!  BUY IT!",1
"One of the best most underrated free to play games out there, with a business model so fair you will start throwing money at your screen and the game's devs if you play this game for an extended period of time.  The game itself is an isometric action rpg, with at the time i'm writing this a roster of 57 playable characters, while you may not like playing every single one, with that many, there's bound to be a few you'd like playing and even without playing a dime you can try every single one of them to see which you like the most!  Then there's a story mode, several challenge modes and other things to do while you're leveling your characters, then at level 60 once you accumelate some gear, you can start raiding! Yes, raiding in an action rpg, while it may not be the most fleshed out raiding system you've ever seen, it's still a ton of fun.  As you can see, i have a few hours in this game and therein also lies the biggest con of this game, once you hit certain gear points, there's no real challenge to be found anywhere, the devs are working on it, but as of right now there's a real lack of challenge for very well geared people, good news is, if you start now it will take several months to get to that point at least.  TL;DR: if you love marvel, give this game a try, if you love action rpg's you owe it to yourself to try this game, if you love both.. then what the hell are you waiting for, go play!",1

Imagine the open world and supernatural horrors of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. set in the 1600s, with a intense color style that only uses black, white, and red.   There is a slider to adjust the way the game looks, including the ability to add color, but honestly the game works perfectly fine as is.  Ignore the metacritic reviews of the journalists, as they have absolutely no clue what they are talking about. This game is excellent. Don't let this game fly under your radar, it is absolutely worth checking out.",1

"So after 25 Hours in this game, where in the first 10 I wanted to hate it, and be able to bash Ubisoft. I have to say, I am having an absolute blast. This feels just like Destiny, I can already see the content complaints people will be making next week working there way to the interwebs.   I think outside the Dark Zone is 100% solid, I loved the missions, Im excited for the Year 1 content. I like the daily missions, and the use of special tokens. BUT I feel like once I hit 30 I have no reason to be out of the Dark Zone unless it is for the Dailies.   Now for inside the Dark Zone, the entire concept of going Rouge is broken. If I go rouge why am I to be punished so HEAVILY? If I survive a Level 5 Rogue (Which nobody does) I get 600 credits, if I die I will lose 6500 credits, 3 Dark Zone Keys, All of my loot, and a ton of XP. There is definetly a slight rework that is needed for this area. Now I like the way they have handled chest and instance spawns. I really enjoy running my route not knowing if something will be there or not. So good job Massive on that design area.   All in all, Im 25 hours in, I do 92k DPS and have 77k HP, and I feel no where near done with getting myself kitted out. I think Massive did a wonderful job, and really reccomend picking this game up!",1

"Loved it on PS3, still love it on PC.  Some people describe it as Skyrim mixed with Dark Souls, and I feel it's appropriate even if that misses out on all the differences.  I personally just love climbing on my enemies' faces, throwing my allies and enemies around, and just having an awesome time.  The worst part IMO is the vision obscuring glow effects, but there's a mod for reducing those, so it's OK.",1

Firstly after hours and hours of playing I haven't even touched the surface of this game as you can get caught up in so many things, sure there's a few bugs at the start but once you get passed all that it plays so smoothly and I wasn't quite sure how it was going to play but the creators of this game managed to do it, really addictive, 10/10",1

"I have been playing since the open beta in 2012. I'm still playing it. Why?  It's a lot of fun.  It is as simple or as complex as you wish to make it.     You want simple?   You can run around using default loadouts not caring where you shoot. In that sense it is 'just glorified deathmatch in giant robots'    You want complex?     Use targeting information to find weak spots on enemy mechs. Make tactical decisions about whether to destroy an arm or a side torso that contains the most dangerous weapons on your opponent before finishing them off,or go straight for the kill through their heavily-armoured centre torso section.  (Or maybe, if you think they might have an XL engine, go for a less-protected side torso first and get a quicker kill).    Pilot nimble, lightly-armed mechs or massive lumbering weapon-laden assaults. Learn which tactics work for each mech class and each weapon, on each map.    Spend hours in the mechlab customising mechs with the balance of speed, armour and weapons that suit your playstyle.  -  These latter points are what lays the foundation of the game's claim to being 'the thinking man's shooter'.  It's also possible to do all of this   without investing a penny  , but you have to invest the time to earn the money to buy what you want.  Personally, I have paid around £60 over the 3 years, which for the amount of hours of fun I have got out of the game beats the value of almost all the AAA titles I own.   The main reason I paid money was to show support for the game, so that it carries on being developed and played, not because there was something behind a paywall that I desperately needed.  Try it out. If you have never played a mechwarrior game make sure you play the tutorial!",1
"TF2 ruined my life, I neglected my friends, family and girlfriend, i put tf2 before schooling and since i began playing i have become a social hermit, unable to rationalise or converse with normal humans, Now even my own parents do not accept me, tf2 is all i have, i must now become one with the children they are my only true comrades I ♥♥♥♥ED YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT!!!!!!",1
"Get this game only if you like games where you play as factions and get to conquer other factions, especially in Roman times. This game is in the Republic era so no Augustus yet. The multiplayer works fine for those without Hamachi. The game itself is great! I love playing as the Romans and conquering eveeryone!",1

"Good stuff:-its fun to play(only if you like MMO RPG games)  -90% of the things in game were made by community  -club system is great   -a lot of different costumes so you can customize your character   Bad stuff:-its too grindy after Mantle of Power expansion, but hey its MMO RPG  -game is not optimized at all and servers are unstable   If you have problems with FPS in game then try to put your graphics on medium and activate Multi-threading.",1

"This right here is the first good indie game, with a bunch of improvements over the 2003 version. ♥♥♥♥ is very awesome.",1
Why is this game so bloody good?,1
Game has it's bugs but either way I still love it... Keep it up activision.,1
"This game is awesome it mixes visual novels and RPG turn based games system, it has just enough ecchi to still be an all age version according to steams regulations, I had some technical difficulties but it shouldn’t happen to normal people I know people that have played it and never got a single problem besides small ones that shouldn’t be too bad. I suggest this game, for anyone that likes anime, if you what to play in English setting don’t change because, once you hear the Japanese you won’t want to change back, the game is funny, references and brakes the fourth wall. Must buy, especially with the steam sales.",1
Again like in the Metro game shooting a dog takes like 3 shotgun shells when in real life it would take one. All you do is get to a point in the game where you can't get away from the monsters and all you do is die. You have to go unlimited ammo cheat so you can actually have ammo oh and have money to buy new weapons and upgrades. Normal mode is like nightmare mode I can only imagine what it would be like to play the actual nightmare mode. I guess if ant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you would die on that level of difficulty. The Metro bundle shouldn't have been $10 more like 10 cents.,-1
This game is a really good and worth it buy. Very easy to learn however hard to master.,1

"Hvae you ever wanted to do this? ....Push R&amp;S up, get eyes on, call in IDF, surpress the enemy, bring in some CAS and move some mud! Then close with your armor and bring their guns to bear while the dismounts move in and take the city!  How about this? ....Bring in your SEAD aircraft, sniff out and destroy the enemy AAA and SAMs. At the same time you coordinate your arty and to take out the non-emmiting AAA/MANPAD threats. Clear a corridor and bring in your helos loaded with troops and insert them behind a terrain feature and move them through cover to an AP. Bring in a scout and snoop and poop the objective, call in prepping fires, pin the enemy down and unmask your infantry and seize the control point.   You can do all of the combined arms tactics that you have seen in every movie, read in every book, dreamed of while deployed and more.   Wargame.... I love all three of them. The SP campaign is tough and the skirmish mode is an endless load of fun.  You can't get away with playing these games like they are C&amp;C or CoH, you actually have to use your brain and flex some strategy. I play on an old 2008 iMac and it functions just fine. Only problem is that in Yosemite when Steam calls home and looks for updates the game locks up. I just kill the WiFi and that fixes it.   Get it, you'll love it.",1
"I downoaded on a whim, and if you\'re interested in making an RPG game, this is definitely the best software out there for doing you. It\'s very easy to get into and understand, and a simple game is very easy to make. For a more serious and advanced creator, there are also a lot of more complicated tools to enhance your gameplay. My only concern is the price. It\'s so ridiculously easy to use that anyone could get hooked on it *cough* me *cough* , but that £60 is sort of a barrier for the less serious creators. If it was cheaper, I feel like more people would buy it, and more quality games could be created.",1
"For all the people that claim the tutorial is too hard/unfair... there is a &gt;&gt;&gt;SKIP button on the bottom right once the menu forces you to the tutorial, which puts you at the last phase, I beat the final tutorial mission first try no mulligan, don't see what the fuss is about. You get one premade deck and unlock more cards as you go, and if you want to view the different color combos the game starts you out with you can always reselect your colors after clearing the tutorial. Hope this is helpful. For all you previous MTGDOP 14 buyers, you get one of the premium boosters unlocked for free once you get to that point in the game, a 5 dollar value woohoo!",1
Game is pretty cool so far :) will update as i continue playing,1
This is one of my favourite games :),1
"   Intuitive? - hahaha... NO. You loot something - have no clue whatsoever about how to use it, and what to do with it. The only thing you know how much it weights in your backpack. (the higher lvl, the heavier, btw)    Wanna questing? Prepare your ESP powers, because the quest 'help' is there only to confuse you further.    Customization of new chars? Forget it. 'Here, pick a gender and a wig - and off you go.'    Talent tree cannot be reversed and reconfigured. Translation: One wrong choice and you're screwed.    To date I haven't managed to figure out if there's any auxiliary storage for your items or not.    Game controls - TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. Yes, you have 3 options (mouse/keyboard/controller) - one worse than the other.    Targetting - I call it 'somehow mode'. You're never sure if your char is going backpedal while shooting (for example), or if s/he turns around, UN-TARGET the boss, and moves wherever you told him/her to. In-fu-ria-ting.    Soundrack - let's call it a 'sociopath factory'.    Resource - I'm not expecting wowhead, but at least SOMETHING would be nice...  It might come across as whiny and spoiled rant and I know some things can be used to. However, these are things I managed to remember (sic!) since I last played it, meaning they left a big impact. Unfortunately.  Summary: Imagine RAGNAROK f*cking Diablo while LOL watches. Not exactly my cup of tea.   ",-1
This game is really fun but needs more maps. ,1
"If you are looking for a rougelike, this is THE game for you. With a vast library of mods, and a great experiance, this is no game that if you beat once, the next run will be easy.",1
"Hmmm... I fear this MAY upset some people but it has to be said. It's definitely not as good as the 2013 reboot BUT it's still a polished game in many aspects. I bought this game at full price BECAUSE I loved the reboot so much (PS4 remastered version, but still the same game really).  Let's start with some of the problems I had with this game... Well, the performance is very inconsistent... for the skeptical ones, my rig has 16 Gb of RAM, an OC'd i5 4670k @ 4.2 GHz, and an OC'd 1060 (6 Gb). No matter how I set the video settings between HIGH and VERY HIGH, I'll still end up with a 40-60 fps treshold in the most unexpected places (ie. confined spaces). However, this won't affect the score I'll give the game... It's just something I want people to consider beforehand.  The characters are somewhat bland, especially Konstantin and Jacob (bad vs good really, they're not really defined in terms of behavioral complexity). I really wanted more out of the (SPOILER SPOILER) newly founded 'betrayal' relationship between Lara and the woman who stood beside the Croft family for years.  The environments all look the same and the tomb puzzles are barely challenging compared to the ones from the orignal... basically, the game doesn't effectively set a certain mood or atmosphere for players to explore with a sense of wonder and accomplishment,  BUT this has to be said: The combat works, there are various weapons and challenges, the game looks and sounds INCREDIBLE, and the plot on its own is much more than I could expect from a TOMB RAIDER game (2013 reboot aside). I was still pleasantly hooked and entertained, and the optional tombs, crypts, and challenges are so freaking rewarding and entertaining. At around a 35-hour playtime, I was ALMOST able to complete the whole game and I NEVER felt bored or left out of an amazing experience.  The game deserves a solid 8.5 out of 10. I consider this a little generous but any fan of the 2013 reboot must at least give this one a shot. I guarantee you won't be dissapointed. ",1
"One of the best turn based roleplaying games ever made. Graphics are decent, but run slowly when show crowds and sometimes crushes to desktop: to avoid problems save quickly as an habit, in this case the effort worth because game is really good. Mechanics is wonderfull, remembers the firsts Fallout titles, but has deeper rules because the player lead a group and their shelter for everything: build upgrades, craft or repair items, manage social conflicts, find more survivals and needs as food, fuel, materials... is really advisable read the manual. Combat is oriented to patience tactics, silence, concealment and ambush. Types of weapons and armours are variety and complete. There are two kind of foes, humans of hostile factions and classic zombies. The sandbox map is huge, with 60 locations, each with a specific situation. Think logically is important, decisions bring consequences and different endings.Texts of choices and missions has no bugs. Touch every common topic of apocalyptical genre, and is really long: explore every corner take circa 200 hours. By the adult dialogues, lack of frenzy action and technical issues, not recommendable for teenagers.",1
"This is deffinitely not a scary game, but is still fun. The story is ineresting, and it tries hard to be a good game. 7.5/10",1
"The lack of sound effects is particularly jarring for an action platformer. Most of the game would be played in silence but for the music.  The crafting system is unintuitive and cumbersome. Some streamlining here would go a long way.  The random generation is nice, but gameplay gets surprisingly stale very quickly.  Could be a pretty good game with some more work in the right areas, but as it stands now I don't find it incredibly fun. You can't just add a poor crafting system to a genre and call it a day.",-1

In the course of events, you may come across more speculations than expected... Recommended!",1
Its a fantastic game i think xephos should try it.,1
Two Grown Men screaming and shouting its only a game its not real and them screaming again in fright.  This is what the game reduced us to.  Without giving to much away your clearly in a haunted house and moving along the corridor every step has you wondering what will happen next.  Like any good horror its not just the visuals that make you scared its everything else all combined. The sound of a door slamming the flickering of lights the gradual build up that leads to a terrifying conclusion. But what sets this apart from a movie of traditional games is the fact that your now in the experience and not just watching. Well done for making me feel so scared. Looking forward to a playable game in October,1
"Excellent, artful, maddening and addictive. No matter how skillful you are, this game reminds you again and again your success or brutal failure is really down to the whims of fate.  If you cannot stand losing, if you can't bare having your victory snatched away for the smallest mistake (or sometimes for no reason at all) then this is not the game for you. You will have to claw your way to survival, suffer for every small triumph, till even making it to the end of the dungeon alive is a heady rush of success brought almost instantly to sobering ground as you count the cost of your bloody battles in injuries and mental trauma that your party WILL suffer.  And then do it all again, and again, and again...",1

"BioShock infinite is hands down the greatest game I have ever played. the story was immersive and packed with surprises and the characters are unique, emotional, and very realistic. By the middle of the game i really cared about the safety of Elizabeth and the downfall of Comstock. The gameplay was fantastic because of things such as the heavy hitter enemies (OHDEARGODAHANDYMANRUN), the weapon and recource catching system, plasmids' ability to ocasionally interact with the enviroment and damage baddies, the many varieties of tears that elizabeth can create, and the use of lockpicks to discover secret areas, each contaning a recording, which acted as the puzzle pieces of columbia's history. BioShock infinite had the ability to make you feel invinsible and hopeless the next just by throwing either new enemies at you or giving you a new person or thing to both fear and hate, such as Daisy Fitzroy or Elizabeth's ♥♥♥♥♥y side. The art stile of this game was beautiful in every way imaginable and made you feel like you were really back in 1912. Or whenever the game takes place. Whatevz. What I really loved was the addition of things that were social issues at the time, such as rascism and smoking, and how they put a little BioShock twist on them. Overall, this game has everything going for it. I couldn't have asked for a better game to add to the BioShock series,   Oh, and the Pepppermill   I looooooove the peppermill",1

"This warhammer is different from attila and that's what people mostly don't like, different doesn't mean worse, here every faction/race plays differently, every single faction it's a different game as never happened before in total war. In the past different faction mostly meant different skin for the same army, a different unit or 2 with different weapons or different stats, not this time, they focused on creating all sort of units, if you are familiar with warhammer then you know what to expexct:  - Slow and powerful dwarfs - Vampire counts raising deads as armies - Greenskins hard to manage for their obedience but strong for their numbers - the empire with their strong machines and average units - chaos moving constantly to spread distruction  They all have their own economy, buildings and so on, don't expect to trade with greenskins (they can't), their economy is based on your economy, in the sense that they are coming for it, as opposite Vampires even produce wine to trade. People who says some things are missing are right, but they fail to mention that for every thing that was 'removed' there is at least 2 new things.  If you want a total war like Attila well, buy attila then, because this time is different and, IMHO, better. I appreciate the fact that they did the possible to create a totally different experience, good job devs.  p.s: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ",1
Long time player. The grind may be strong in this one but its an overall great game.  And the bonus is the dev team that does tend to listen and try to work out the kinks. Totally worth a try since it' free and still good enough to sink some cash in too,1
"  Same bugs as the original Bioshock. FOV and mouse issues still here. REDUCED graphics options in the settings pages, and ever so slightly visual upgrade.

"This game contains ads ... Between every *insert random number* game there will be an unskipable ad page. Look I know it's a thing yadi yada ... devs need money for a living etc But there is plenty other free chess game out there. And quite frankly this version add nothing much (IMO) compared to others. There is the multiplayer mode with steam notifications .... So I guess if you're looking for a effective AND pretty to look at multiplayer with notifications chess game, you've got some incredebly long to write need and it can do the trick. But I am not ready to pay or bear with ad for that. I don't want to bear with ads only for a 100 lvls CPU, probably because I s*ck *ss at chess and can't even beat the 20th lvl CPU, but hey ! That's another story. Point is, you can't take a game which has been done hundreds time, add 'mobile game ads' on it and call it a day. That buisness model won't work on PC.",-1
"Normally I don't like difficult twitch games like TBoI. I liked to watch my brother play the original but I could never play it due to the lack of controller-maps. (Why that is needed, I'm not going to go into for the 50th time- read most of my other reviews, and I'm sure you'll find out).   So I was excited when rebirth came out. More of everything, and controller enabled? I'm on it.  I bought it. Its awesome. Its hard as hell. But strangely addictive. The music in Rebirth has been redone, and its great. The graphics are the typical BoI brightly colored cutesy horrifying covered in tears, poop and blood mutated children, fetuses, and god-knows-what-else we know and love. Theres more unlockables, more items, more enemies, more secrets. Add in the DLC Afterbirth and you get even *more* of everything. But theres some balance issues with the DLC.  Those aspects are what make Rebirth great. Every run you learn a little more, improve your knowledge of the game, hone your reflexes. Sometimes you'll move one screen from spawn and get absolutely unfairly crushed, sometimes you'll make it to Mom. Thats the fun of this game. Keep trying, learn what items do,how new enemies attack, keep going. Maybe someday you'll win. (I haven't). But once you win, theres a *whole* lot more after that. Beating Mom is just the first step.   The issue with the DLC I found was that for people like me just learning the game and getting my reflexes down (I had to switch RS and LS to make it work - took some learning), it can add some enemies that are many times tougher than the standard enemies for the map you're on. And they aren't ones you unlock, they're just there. That and I keep getting 'burning basement' nearly every single run. And it seems theres so many items you have a way more likely chance of getting a garbage item.  If you've played the original, this one is totally worth picking up - theres way more of everything enough to keep any BoI fan busy. Even for someone like me who rarely plays games like this, its totally addictive.",1
Warning! STAY AWAY. Contains Ubisofts crappy DRM 'UPlay' and requires online registration in order to play. Do not buy this game.,-1

Great game which unfortunately runs bad. Totally worth it though unless your pc is a potato,1

"Writing this review immediately after finishing the game.  Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person adventure, with quite a few aspects of the horror genre. The game is rather short (Roughly five hours), and the combat in the game is simply sneaking up behind the enemies and pressing a combination of buttons. Although the combat was a bit repetitive, the story itself was rather interesting for me. You play as a recently murdered detective named Ronan, who is has been left behind as a ghost in the mortal world, because he has unfinished business, which won't allow him to join his wife; who has already moved on.   In order for Ronan to move on he has to find out the mystery behind his killer. As he is a ghost, he can only tamper with very few things in the mortal world, so with the help of a young girl named Joy, they work together to unravel the mystery between the Bell Killer murders, as well as the identity of the killer.  7.5/10",1
"97% of people who buy La-Mulana never finish the storyline. Check the 'global achievement stats' and see for yourself.  I urge caution in buying this. Some people like it; I like it. But many  don't understand what they're buying . The game is 'hard' -- but not only 'hard'. It's deeply flawed:   The first few hours are awful.   Some puzzles are tedious and the solutions random.   Some puzzles expect you to draw and annotate maps.   You will need to go out-of-game to get help on puzzles; no one lucks onto the solution of every puzzle. Bear in mind that going out-of-game means seeing spoilers, and meta-gaming like 'Does it 'feel like cheating' to look up X after putting in Y effort?' It fundamentally changes the experience.  Some of us like the game anyway, because of the quality of art and music, sense of exploration, replay value in speedruns, etc. We like it in spite of its flaws; you may not.  Here's what you can try. There's a free La-Mulana 2 demo available on Kickstarter. Since it's an early demo, it uses the same engine as La-Mulana, and is highly similar: the same jump, the same whip, the same style of puzzles. It's also a better newbie experience; it introduces important mechanics sooner, and more clearly. Try it first. Will you end up drawing your own map, and will you enjoy it? Or googling maps and answers, and will you enjoy  that ? Try it and decide.  I hope you make an informed decision, the decision best for you. It's not just 'other people' who don't enjoy this game. It's a lot of people.",-1
"Not seeing what the problem is. No crashes, no bugs that I've been able to notice. Runs solid. Gameplay is a little confusing as far as certain interactions. However the developers did quite well in making you feel like a speck on the butt of a flea on the tip of a pencil. You feel so small in this game it's a tad overwhelming at first. 8/10 Would get lost in the cosmos again.  And I should also mention that I'm playing this on a rig that I built in July of 2011. So I don't know. I guess I just don't care as much.",1

"If you are looking for a Mario Kart PC equivalent, get this. I thought I would get bored in a few minutes but I ended up playing all night! Well worth the price of admission.",1
"This game wears it's inspiration on it's sleeve - it's so much like Left 4 Dead you'll find some of your old techniques work just as well in Vermintide. It's basically the same mechanics - fight of hordes of cannon fodder npcs (in this case, Skaven which are ratmen) while keeping a sharp eye out for special Skaven that seek to pin and separate members of the group. It even includes 'boss' fights in the form of a Rat Ogre (think of the L4D tank) and patrolling teams of StormScaven (that can be avoided like the wandering witch from L4D2 - it's really better NOT to fight them)  That being said - the game is more melee focused than range focused. So depending on your blunderboss or crossbow for most of your work is unwise - it's best saved for special situations.  There are 5 classes in the game, each with their own distinct personalities and weaponsets. Each class has several weaponsets of their own which have their own attack animations and various strengths and weaknesses. some are better at handling large single targets, some are good at cleaving large numbers of foes, others are better at blocking or knocking down foes. There's bound to be a weaponset that suits your playstyle.   The game also has a random loot system and a leveling system. All the leveling appears to do is give out free weapons at every level and unlock maps and features in the Inn (which is more or less the lobby).   The Loot system is very interesting. You see, you get to roll 8 dice at the end of a SUCCESSFUL run. The default dice have a 1 and 3 chance of giving you a point. The number of points you get determines which loot on the random loot table to your right you get. The more points you get, the better the loot. The harder the difficulty you set for the mission, the better the loot table you get. You can further increase your chances in the roll by finding certain dice in the level. Each special die you find replaces one of the 8 dice you have. These dice have better chances of rewarding a point. Ones you find in chests, for example, give you a 50/50 chance of getting a point. There is Tomes you can pick up (each level has 3), these tomes give you a dice that gives you a 66 percent chance at a point. The catch? you need to give up your healing item to hold it. There's also a skaven you can find and kill (but he runs right into a horde) that will drop you a loot die. Finally, there's two skaven grimoirs you can find that guarantee you'll get a point - but the cost is your potion slot and 25% of your team's health - additionally if you drop the grimoire either purposely or by dying - it's lost for the rest of that round and cannot be recovered.  So as you can see, the game actually ENCOURAGES you to explore rather than just rush through everything and rewards you for taking that additional risk. Greater risk for the chance of a greater reward.  As for mechanically, here's how it breaks down  DIFFICULTY  In all difficultys, the higher you go the harder the Scaven hit and the better your loot table. However there are additional things to consider Easy and Normal - No difference other than the above Hard - You start with no Heal items. Nightmare - Friendly fire is turned on for ranged weapons and bombs. Cataclysm - Friendly fire is ramped up.  GRAPHICS - Spot on. I have no complaints about it. The game is absolutely pretty to behold. Only complaint I have is that I think a little more work could of been done to make the player characters easier to make out in the middle of the chaos. Otherwise they did great. They really nailed it your first person animations. The way blood flies in relation to your strike helps build the immersion.  MUSIC - fine at first, but gets a bit repetive. I've tried turning it down, but doesn't seem to help.  SOUND EFFECTS - spot on and satisfying. When steel meets blood and bone, there is little doubt of what's going on. Additionally, the sound idenifyers of the special and boss ratmen are hard to miss once you know what they sound like.  COMBAT MECHANICS - the melee combat is fun and serviceable, but just clunky enough to annoy you from time to time. You have stamina which is spent for blocking and pushes and comes back at a reasonible rate. And the block works as it shoud. But it's really hard to get a feel for the reach each weapon has, especially in an online environment with a weak host. The distance each strike reaches is just inconsistant enough for you to notice. Don't get me wrong though, it's good enough to be fun.  AI - This is probably the games biggest weak point. Pathfinding for the NPC's is based on the strength of the hosts CPU. Weaker computers give you some really wonky pathfinding. Some of the later maps you can really see the difference. And the bots? Barely usable. They tend to get stuck if there's a special Skaven behind you.   Overall? On a 5 star scale this game is a solid 4 stars. If i was grading it, I'd give it a 85. It's a considerably above average game with solid mechanics. It's only let down with some shoddy pathfinding on a few of the map. At the price they're offering, it's more than fair. I recomend this game.",1
pure awsomeness,1
"I bought every single product made by Amplitude studio, and I must say one thing: I regret nothing.  Dungeon of the Endless is a unique blend of tower defense and rogue like, dungeon crawler rpg, which ask you to bring your heroes to safety while protecting your unique source of power, the crystal. You achieve this by opening door after door until you find the exit for that particular level, hoping that the next room won't hide any monster.  You can choose between a huge variety of character, each one with unique passive skills, active abilities and personality (yes, the guys from Amplitude managed somehow to wonderfully characterize every hero giving them a striking personality shown through descriptions and sentences screamed during battles), and those heroes can level up as you progress in your adventure.   This is DotE in just a few words, but you really have to play this gem to understand its value.  Quick positive and negative points: +challenging resource management  +very well characterized heroes +pixel art graphic +deep and surprisingly wide lore that synergizes with the Endless franchise +easy to learn mechanics  +funny and satisfying achievements +very innovative gameplay (never seen anything like this) +LOT of irony  -sometimes it doesn't matter how good you are, if luck doesn't support you, it's game over -might seem very hard at the beginning, just don't give up ",1
"  would I recommend this game to people who don't care about achievement? if this was aronud 3,50€, yes.  would I recommend this game to completionists? hell no, this is the worst!  I usualy show the good and bad of each games, but this is a puzzle game, so there's not a lot to review on that aspect. (but if you really want me to review this part of the game: the puzzles can be completed) what I can review though, is the rest AKA the zombie minigame.  while playing the puzzle, the minigame is fine, it's easy and just acts as a diversion from the puzzle, plus, you can play without this minigame, which is great!  the minigame in the main menu though? it sucks.  you have to choose between using your gun, which kill zombies in 3 hits, and grenades, which kills zombies in one hit... and you have unlimited grenades... in other words, the minigame is just you standing in the middle of the screen spamming grenades at zombies  'but blü, this isn't the main game, who cares?' completionists like me. this minigame is tied to achievements... and they're he worst!  for instance, the achievement that wants you to survive in the minigame (which, again, is just spamming grenades) for 1 HOUR. and that's not the only one, there's another one that wants you to kill 5000 zombies IN ONE RUN (I've spent my entire day killing more than 5000 zombies in one game session, and it didn't work, so you definitely have to kill 5000 in one run!).  then, in other news, the options don't get saved, meaning that the game goes back to fullscreen and max sound/volume everytime you launch the game again!    so all in all, the puzzles are cool, but the price is way to high for me to recommend it. and if you're a completionist, I highly recommend you avoid this game.",-1

8/10 A tough one. This game is great at some things and mediocre at others.    The Combat,1
"This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played or even seen. That goes for both visuals and soundtrack. The vector graphics are absolutely stunning. Each area is more beautiful than the last.  I'm not exactly an RPG connoisseur but the gameplay is also far more interesting than most RPGs, IMO. The battle timeline, inspired by some FF games, makes the combat far more engaging than just pressing the same button over and over for every battle. Your speed stats as well as the timing of your attacks actually matters, which is rare in a turn-based RPG.  The oooooooooonly complaint I have about this game is that it is not frame-rate independent (unless I'm missing some settings), so if you find that it is a very slow-moving game there's a good chance it is just lagging. The gameplay got about twice as fast when I decreased the resolution. I'm playing on a laptop though; if you have a good gaming computer you shouldn't have problems. And I HIGHLY recommend playing this on a good gaming computer if at all possible, because the visuals are so absolutely gorgeous.  I guess I have another semi-complaint and that is that the story is very simplistic and some of the characters are pretty forgettable. I especially dislike that there are not one but TWO clown sidekicks. But that is a very minor issue with an otherwise excellent game.",1
"Okay... So i know i don't have much playtime to this game yet. But that is only because of one simple reason.... The game won't start. It keeps crashing on me, right after the intro. I bought the game, and installed it, started it up. Got into the game on looked around the options menu a bit and twisted a knob here and there, then i restarted the game as it wanted. and the it started crashing. So i searched the interwebs, for a solution, which i found. So i deleted everything GC3 on my computer as it suggested. This and a new install of the game, got me into the game again, and this time i started the tutorial, and it was great, loved it. Then the dang sleepy eyes kicked in, and off to bed i went. Then i woke up this morning, and wanted to play again, but dangit it started crashing again. Therefor until that is fixed i am unfortunatly gonna give it a thumbs down.",-1
"Yea this game is pretty meh if you ask me. The main campaign is fun to play but the story aspect isn't very interesting. I'd say set your expectations to low before picking up this game. Also the driving mechanics is just filthy, like driving on ice constantly.",-1
Can someone please tell me what the DLC adds?,1
"+ Courses look great, fun to walk through + Controls are solid, easy to pickup and play + Putting is acurate, ball seems a bit slow tho + Enviornmental sounds are great (when music is off) - Music quickly becomes maddenning (you can turn it off) - Textures disapear for no reason - Grass / Leave textures look really fake in VR - Courses are unfair if your trying to get a competitive score - Course design neglates player hovering in air / standing in objects  Overall I think this is a solid putt-putt game, but it's not nearly as engaging as some of the other titles. It probably won't get nearly as much play time on my list. Maybe with more content it will get better.  Edit: My intial impression was low because 1) the music put me in a bad mood and 2) I had placed a controller on my desk without turning it off, which meant the grid was up all the time and caused some textures to disappear. This is really the best putt-putt game I've played. As a golfer, this is very realistic, to the extent that I curl up my toes as the ball inches toward the hole. I only wish I could disable the texture disappear 'feature' that is so distracting.",1
Such an enjoyable and lovely game.,1
"PROS: -Player base is significantly less toxic than other games (I'm looking at you CSGO) -Intuitive gameplay -Team comp actually matters -New maps are free  CONS: -Servers still having issues, despite how long this game has been out -Game 100% relient on servers being up as there is no campaign -Map diversity/relplayablity is exceptional  FINAL THOUGHTS: If you were one of the lucky few to pick up the starter edition for $15 then progression is a bit slow, but hey it was $15! However, this game really sets itself apart from the usual twitch shooters. Here's to hoping that Ubisoft continues to improve and support this game. They've stated that longevity is their goal with this one. Let's pray they keep their promise. Don't be turned off by the low number of maps. Each season brings 2 new characters and a new map, with the latter being free to everyone. The maps are so diverse and with a plethora of options as far as objective spawning goes, no two games will ever be the same. I'm 50+ hours in and I still don't know the maps. ",1
This was before Call of Duty so if you play that and like it you will like this. Also has zombie mod and various others.,1
11 out of 10 would make bacon again,1
Good f2p game Too good for f2p,1
Very good core game play. This is a very fast objective based FPS that will keep you on your toes.,1
Winter is coming. 10/10 You're never prepared.,1
"'Here comes the epic RPG you've been waiting for' (qoute from trailer). I'd say that just about sums it up.  It's still getting regular very updates too, and the modding tools look very promising. The devs are awesome.  Crafting, awesome skills and spells with great effects on baddies and the environment, deep character development, stats influenced by dialog choices - it's REALLY fun.   Hopefully multiplayer will get a little bit of polish (though don't get me wrong, it's very playable and awesome as it is).",1
"A very good game i really enjoied it, whorts all the money",1
"This game is an absolute classic, and is one of my favourite games, along with Battlefront II and KOTOR. This is an absolute masterpiece of a squad based FPS, and in my opinion represents a style of development that hasn't been seen since this game. Everything from the quirky remarks of 62, to 07's unsettling level of bloodlust, to the satisfying feeling of knifing a pesky Geonosian, everything in this game is perfect. As far as a story based FPS goes, this one is at the top of my list, and might always be. For $10.99 CAD, to relive an old favourite of mine on the original Xbox, revamped with better graphics and controls, this is an absolute must for any Star Wars or FPS fan, 10/10.",1
"This game is pretty sweet!~ It is a mix between old school Megaman/Zero Style gameplay with mouse tracking for attack location and skills.  The gameplay itself is very basic. You swing sword/shoot, but you can dash forward, double jump, shield yourself from attack, or fly accross the screen to reach a target.  Only took me an hour to finish but it would have been sooner, but the flying level I didn't understand at first. (You shoot one object and then move the mouse to another object to transfer the shot like connection nodes.)  After beating it, you unlock more charactors to beat the game with. I think it had 7 levels with multiple bosses per level. I can see people wanting to revisit and beat with every char if you love this kind of game.  Totally recommend for those that want a simple action game kind of like Megaman/Zero with lots of bosses.  As a side note: If you grew up on Nes, SNES, or Gen: Start on hard mode or you will find itt too easy.",1
"Amazing game. Don't think about it, play it.",1
"This is an absolutely gorgeous tabletop game, which offers hours upon hours of fun and variety. The random nature of, what takes place here can offer replayability (Definitely does for me).  Great graphics, artstyle reminds me a lot of the old Disney cartoons. Gameplay is turn-based, which gives you enough time to think about your next move. The turns also change between Day and Night, which brings in another dynamic to the game.   I've enjoyed the little time I've had with it so far and I'm sure, that I'll enjoy it for at least a hundred hours to come!    Random nature:  - The laws the King can propose are randomized and different every time. (The 'law pool' seems to be quite big) - Dice rolls determine different outcomes for combat and the like. You can control this by burning cards, but still. The unknown is sometimes fun and in this case it is. - A lot of different quests in the 'quest pool', which can change the way you play. You only get to choose from three at a time. - Map changes with every playthrough, as noted in the features section. This actually also changed my playstyle quite a bit (Same with the different characters and cards I kept getting)   Victory conditions: I know of FOUR different ways to win this game, which means there are multiple ways to play each match.   My Preview of the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQ6niMLYEU&amp;feature=youtu.be ",1
"Very fast paced, you can even go on to 1st person by pressing B. how ♥♥♥♥ing amazing is that?",1
"This game is not without its flaws, but it is still massively fun to play. It comes with a Glide wrapper, but DOSBOX needs to have the config files edited to enable it. Once you do so, you'll be able to get the game in much higher resoutions than were available before by using the 3DFX version. The ranking system in game is based entirely on how many points you earn in a match, so find a good map that you can get a lot of points on and grind it as much as possible. You can unlock some cars through play, but when you finish all the maps in the game and 'beat' it you unlock everything, even cars that don't unlock normally. The levels do not confine you to one track, you can explore to your heart's content - assuming you don't run out of time. Even the semi-Stand Alone expansion, the Splat Pack, is included. Just remember, this is an old game with some early design ideas that didn't always work well, but the game IS very fun to play and enjoy!",1

To be honest this game is amazing! I love the idea of all the difficulties for all of the lvls! I even love the lvl design! GG Geometry Dash GG,1
Too difficult. Not enough stamina and finding stamina is rare. Voice actor is a questionable choice.,-1

"Ah, Fallout: New Vegas. One of the best games that I've ever played. While Fallout 3 was an FPS with RPG elements, this is an RPG with FPS elements. Choices are more diverse, no obvious 'big baddie' to go kill, all factions have upsides and down sides, morality isn't as black and white as it was in Fallout 3, weapon modding is a big improvement, the way the game handles leveling, xp, perks, traits, skills, and how nicely it stuck to the lore of Fallout 1 and 2 while Fallout 3 just...    Sorry for just gushing like that, but what can I say? This is a fantastic game; huge improvement over Fallout 3, only lacking in atmosphere, enviroment/map, and graphics. Stability issues are also a big no-no, so you should definitly go out and get the New Vegas Anti Crash mod right off the bat. (along with many other fantastic mods: it's a whole new world out there!)  I'd recommend it to anyone, although I feel Fallout 3 is a better choice to start out on, since it's mechanics are far more simplistic.",1
This is a masterpiece of a strategy game that has been revied in glorious HD and with Steam Workshop functionality... An absolute must for anyone who crave a simple addictive medieval style RTS without all the hardcore politics b.s.  Pro's   - Extremely fun &amp; addictive gameplay - Easy to learn and play - Multiplayer is simple to use and get working  - Mod support  - Contains various story modes and custom games (which can be edited thoroughly) - For a 17 year old game it still holds up remarkably well.   Cons   - Multiplayer saves desync upon re-loading.,1
"You pretty much know what you are getting into when you purchase a Sims game. I love this game to death, I think they really kicked it out of the park with the improvements in this compared to The Sims 2, and I would recommend it to anyone! My only complaint is because Steam combines any DLC into the game, you cannot choose which DLC you want to play the game with....so...there is that.",1
This game is awesome like in real life you are driving with trucks :D,1
Literally the best and only pirate game I have ever played.,1
this game is not journey so leave that away from it and you'll truly enjoy it. This game is artsy as possible and no combat so just know that before giving it a negative review.,1
"One of the best RPG/Adventure games I've ever played, and I've played games from Fallout to Skyrim. This game provides endless hours of fun as you explore and get accustomed to the game. Even better, there are many mods for the game that further nchance your experiance. One of my personal favorites is Anno Domini. This mod puts you into 13th century Europe, with an enourmous map to explore and more factions than I can remember! 10/10 would play for another 1k hrs.",1
"Their servers are garbage with a a great game. It's really sad. Also, if you're not a fan of RNG then not play or don't complain.",1
"This is an incredible game! I am happy to see a perfect port from the XBOX 360 version.  The style of this game is very unique. Controlling both brothers at the same time might take you some time to get used to, but it is this style of game play that makes you understand how close the brothers are.  The story is very heartwarming and presented through a world of fantasy, with breathtaking visuals and an amazing soundtrack. Though the characters in the game speak an unknown language, it is easy to understand what the story is about and what they are communicating with each other about through their physical gestures.  The addition of Steam achievements is also a nice bonus.  Highly recommended.",1
What a ♥♥♥♥ing rip off I cant even start the game. I should have read the reviews first,-1
Disassamble the engine parts by parts... It was the battery's fault. 10/10 would make an emtpy space again under the hood!,1
"100 games, but they are mostly ones we have seen before in other collections.  The presentatoon is slick and pleasing with 3D rendered boxes and cabinets looking sharper tha n ever before. The online multi-player is what wil lset this title apart from any previous ones. Dozens of the game can be played online, and it really breathes new life into old classics. Games like Combat! Outlaw, Surround, Bowling, Basketball, and even 3D Tic Tac Toe feel new and vibrant when playing against online foes. I have not enjoyed these games this much in 30 years.  There are few bugs though. Some games offer multiplayer whre there is no multi-player to be had (i.e. Basic Math). Also, games exit out abruptly and don't let you see the final score. This is espcially apparent in mutli-player games where there is no option to rematch or replay, and the game ends before you can even see who won. However, even with this issue,s it's a great package and shows a lot of promise if Atari can keep it going.   For an update/DLC/version 2.0 I'd suggest adding any Lynx games Atari has the rights for, as the Comlynx games would play well here. Also, any classic 8-bit Computer games would be nice, including Star Raiders, Caverns Of Mars, etc. Ditto for 5200 and 7800 games. Also, 2-player cpin-ops like X's and o's Atari football would be awesome to play online. ",1
The most overrated game in history.,-1
"It's like a rogue-like with all the good elements of a rogue-like removed. Plays a bit like toe jam and earl... Like almost exactly like it... Minus the random maps... Remember those good bits removed. Yeah...  I can't recommend it, but I had a laugh playing it...",-1
"Interesting platformer. The characters all have different little quirks, so if you're having trouble with a level as one, you can switch to another and try again to take advantage of their abilities. Plenty of levels (and a lot of cool fanmade ones as well, which is a huge +), all with varying degress of difficulty, ranging from the, 'Woah, that was easy, finished it under a minute!' to 'I swear to god, if I fail that jump again I'm going to punch this screen with a shotgun.' difficulty. All in all, it's REALLY fun and addictive. I suggest checking it out.",1
"Wether you're looking for some light and casual mass-murderer-simulator or you are the 'achievement-freak' trying to speedrun through levels looking for your next highest score, this game is surely entertain you with its beatiful pixel art, nice music and dark humor, but it is not exactly a good stealth game. Some things are just weird, like super cops with a gps on their heads that can find you anywhere after a call, but who are super chill about you killing people next to them while they check corpses. However, once you forget it's not supposed to be realistic, you understand the rules and mechanics of the game and then you start having a lot of fun. Also it's deeply frustrating sometimes; while in games like Hotline Miami you keep dying and trying again in a very fluid and fast paced way, Party Hard makes each turn very long, so each death makes you feel more tired than challenged to make something different. It's even more depressing when you lose just because you got stuck at an object...  TL;DR  Party Hard is just like being a psycho killer: you get used to it, stop getting annoyed by reality and enjoy a good old blodbath. You give your best, but sometimes s**t happens and you go to jail or get beaten to death.   Rating: 8/10",1
"One of the best coop/single player shooters ever.. wonderful mechanics, loot galore.. tough bosses.. and general mayhem..   And the difficulty and number of enemies increases as the number of friends increases.. definitely NOT to be missed.",1
"People seem to not like this, maybe because Call Of Duty is way different. I decided to get the game, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. I don't know what you people were thinking when you wrote your reviews, but I think it is very fun. Challenging and unfair at times, but fun. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge, not someone who is so hip on COD.",1
Great game. Got a lot better. Now if we could just get rid of exploiters....,1
"Art: 9/10  Basically the best pixel art I've ever seen. However, some animations felt slightly under par, particularly on some party members.  Music: 9/10  Actually really really good.  Gameplay: 6/10  My two biggest issues with the game as a whole are the enemies and movement mechanics. The bosses are way too easy, I only died to the final boss once and most other bosses I did not die at all on. There are no enemies outside of bosses that were a real threat, outside of 'trap' enemies, and the static obstacle Pirates. The greatest depth in movement is tapping B every half second, or much later on (for basically a single level), using a grappling hook thing.   This game I feel would be greatly improved by adding extra abilities to the player throughout the game, and having more varied and difficult enemies, as well as making the bosses more difficult. However, this is coming from a person with 3000 hours in the Dark Souls series, so take some of that with a grain of salt.  In addition to those issues, the levels often seem very simple. All of them are entirely linear, with weak puzzles that feel more like chores than anything.  Story: 7/10 The story at times is rather generic, however at other points it is extemely engaging. Kind of a mixed bag here.  Overall: 7/10 Needs more depth, and difficulty.",1
Meh. Not worth a single penny.,-1
Probably the best game ever made!,1
10/10 would win only with monks and have large amounts of lag again   pls fix the lag,1
Its so beautiful...,1
Don't like football. Don't like RC cars. F***ING LOVE THIS GAME!!!,1
"An fps with multiple game modes, realistic(ish) gunplay and interesting situations, because of how fast you can die, or win with objectives. I have only played around 15 hrs tho so I don't know how long lasting the game is yet. Anyways I like it and would definately recommend if you are looking for a multiplayer fps without killstreak bonuses, bulletsponge enemies or strange recoil/aiming decisions. Also don't think I've heared or seen anyone cheating yet, and most ppl playing are somewhat new, so there isnt one guy soloing everything with ease.",1
This game reminded me of the side scrollers of old including how hard it was. Very fun game with lots of interesting enemies. The final boss was by far the most annoying/rewarding boss to defeat. I would recommend this game to anyone that grew up in the 80's and early 90's and were used to hard side scrollers such as mega man.,1

This game is very addicting from the second you play it. Starting off with a cheap truck doing small jobs that cover a small distance all the way to carrying explosives and cars from Glasgow to somewhere in poland. It gets harder as you get further as truck damage starts costing more the higher level that you are but it doesnt subtract from the fun you relaxing times you can have while playing this incredible game.,1
It took me 2 hours to install.  It took me 10 seconds to uninstall.,-1
....................,1
"this game make me enjoy and have fun,  together with my friends and some new friends. :)  very cool!!!",1
"Great game, Needs more servers however. I hate waiting 30 minutes to get in a game, or even 934 minutes.... WHICH ISNT LONG AT ALL  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=481133317 ",1
"A little dated, but still an excellent game. Varied and takes a long time to complete.  You may encounter some bugs though. But there's a good mod which fixes a lot of these and reinstates sections of the game that were cut out before release (it adds quite a bit of new content).",1
"The people who are giving negative reviews are literally brain dead. I picked this game up shortly after I got FNV on the PC, and then realized that I needed all the DLC to use 99% of the mods I got this on PC for. So I just did my thing and ♥♥♥♥ed with mods that didn't need the DLC. On the 360, I've clocked in at LEAST 500 hours in Fallout 3. There will be huge spoilers ahead, so if you haven't completed, or are debating on BUYING fallout 3, I reccomend not reading this review.  TL;DR version of the review: ♥♥♥♥'s good, yo.   As someone who's played every single fallout game, yes, even THAT game. The one on PS2/Xbox that nobody wants to acknowledge. I can safely say while Fallout 3 was a drastic change for the series, it's still very enjoyable. It's arguable which is better, fallout 1/2/Tactics, or 3/NV/4. Me, I'm more of a Fallout 2/Tactics/FNV guy. But this isn't for Fallout 2, Tactics, or FNV.  Fallout 3 begins with your birth. Your mother dies from cardiac arrest shortly after you pop your little head out, and dad begins to question this freshly born infant on it's name, and what it wants to grow up to look like. After your mother dies, the game skips a year or so, and you pick your S.P.E.C.I.A.L here. For reference, mine is usually something like this. S: 7 P: 5 E:7 C: 4 I: 6 L: 1. Then, you go through life in the vault, eventually getting your very own Pip-Boy 3000, a BB gun, and taking your G.O.A.T to determine your tag skills. One day, dad leaves the vault, and everything goes to ♥♥♥♥. With the help of your childhood friend (or not), you escape Vault 101, and emerge blinking into the wastes. You eventually find your way to Megaton, and get info from a supposed friend of your father's. Then you make your way to Galaxy News Radio, meet the brotherhood, acquire a nuclear catapult, and ♥♥♥♥ up some giant roid rage mutant with the help of a bunch of dudes in power armor with laser guns. After meeting the charismatic Three Dog, your eventually find your way to vault 112, and free Dad from the horrific simulator that the man who built the Garden Of Eden Creation Kit rules. You then enlist the help of some scientists who live on half of a big ♥♥♥ metal boat, who are also apparently your dad's pals. Once more, ♥♥♥♥ goes to hell when the batman army, also known as the Enclave, attacks the purifier, intending to take it over. Your father sacrifices himself to kill a bunch of batmen, but Colonel Autumn survives because of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mystery drug. You enlist the help of the Brotherhood of Steel, and run off to vault 87 to retrieve the G.E.C.K. The Enclave somehow kidnaps you, and then you get to be interrogated by a now-gray haired Colonel Autumn. President Eden tells him to ♥♥♥♥ off so that he can meet you. On your way there, Colonel Autumn makes the batmen ignore Eden's order, and attack you. After carving a bloody path to Eden, you find out the president of the Enclave is just a genocidal computer, which you can then trick into comitting suicide, or obey his orders to posion the purifier for some reason. You then escape, and find out that the Enclave has fortified their position at the purifier, and so the Brotherhood of Steel finally unveils Liberty Prime, who then proceeds to bend the enclave over, and roughly ♥♥♥♥ them up the ♥♥♥ while you make your way into the rotunda, and activate Project Purity. Then you die. Unless you have Broken Steel. Then you awaken two weeks later, and find out that the batman army is still hanging on for dear life. You once again work with the BoS to finish off the Enclave, the penultimate blow being when you use their orbital missile thing to nuke their mobile base crawler back to the stone age. Then you're free to explore the Capital Wasteland as you please.  There's a lot to this game, and I only covered the main story, and the DLC that allows you to continue after activating Project Purity. Tons of sidequests for you to do, loot to find, allies to befriend, enemies to make, all that jazz. Fallout 3 is defintely one hell of a game, and if you can muster the (very little) brainpower to make it work on newer OS, then I reccomend picking up a copy.",1
"Gameplay may seem very GTA-like but the plot and fighting-style definitely make this game stand out. The standard hacking and picklocking is present in this game, but it is something that should be present in this kind of environment. Overall, this was a good buy.",1
"Poor system : - abut 1 hour to finish the 1 quest (seeking drop item and kill) with useless final reward - too large map, so its waste many time to walking around each NPC - very expensive town teleport ( u cant use NPC teleport from farming site ) - bored interface",-1
"Aside from the server being laggy and stuff. The game is pretty good, although at first if you're a newbie you'll find it hard to learn the controls and the names of the items but as time passes by and you play more often, You'll get used to it. :) So I recommend playing this game.",1
"Okay, okay, this is a good game. I want to get global Offensive. So if my PC can run this game can I run global offensive?",1
If Jesus made a game it would be this  9/10 Game  Would purchase even if you are new to the Resident Evil scene,1
"I'm sorry not to recommend this game. Though it's a very fun and simple game, I suggest to buy this only if it's on sale.  Not that this game is no fun. It's a really cool game with OK graphics and easy controls. It's only very hard to keep playing this game. The story mode is really short, and then the only thing that is left to do is zombie mode, which is very fun.  Overal, this game has no storyline, just a few seperate stories, The graphics are not good and not bad, but still it brought me 8 hours of fun.",-1
"Six hours of walking along a pre-determined path triggering boring combat sequences along the way. Very few scary or even fun moments throughout the whole game, and the story will have you rolling your eyes by the end.",-1
Best 3rd Person Shooter game ever.,1
"The past two games in this series [Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead &amp; Arma 3] have been the only titles i've ever played that have put me on the edge of my seat with so many real life emotions! Running mil-sim pvp in both titles has transported me onto the battlefields in such a way that for the experience to be any more real; I would have to actuallly be smelling the stench of dead bodies around me or feeling the desolation of getting 'dear john letters' from home informing me of how i'm now divorced and 'jody' is now enjoying the luxuries of my home [which may actually happen if I don't start cutting back my gametime on Arma 3 - as my wife says it is her number one competition! However... I digress. The developers over at Bohemia Interactive are some of the most dedicated i've seen and for being such a small outfit, they really bust their a$$'s 52 weeks out of the year to make sure that purchasing their products is not just a *buy*install*play couple hundred hours*uninstall; But rather an investment that is constantly progressing in an ever-improving ways, that are packed full of new features. Many of which are community suggested and also many that will just 'O.o' you! So many game developers these days just 'take the money and run' Bohemia strives to continue to EARN your money and keep the game feeling fresh and always optimizing their products to crush any bugs they are made aware of and keep all their coding 'nice and tidy' *my GOD, i did not think I would have so much to say in my first review* And if my above review hasn't convinced you that if you only own one game in your library THIS ONE should be it; then let me continue on with the dazzling facts that should make up your mind. THE MODDING COMMUNITY, AND CO-OP COMMUNITIES!!!!----&gt; These Addon Authors that churn out these Modification Masterpieces are seriously THE BEST out there doing it right now. Many of which should definitely be working for Bohemia, but instead work [not for free] but for the satisfaction of bringing quality game additions and improvements to the community at-large. There are 'mods' that simulate real life conditions and abilities to such extent that you could wish for nothing more. They have truly taken a military combined arms GAME, and provided the possibility (with just one click to select their mod) that turns the entire game into a true simulation with bottomless depth. GAME+ 10/10 MODDING SUPPORT/COMMUNITY+ 10/10 UPDATES AND SUPPORT+ 10/10 BAND 4 YOUR $ = 200/10 :)",1
"This was a joy to play, controls, music and sound are good. But it's the graphics that makes the game a unique game, the graphics are simple but great. The game is a top down shooter with alot in common with Hotline Miami. It's a fast paced experience with alot of dying. The weapon system is great, with old school revolver you have to ♥♥♥♥ by pressing right mouse button, before you can shoot one shot. That took me awhile to learn, but it makes the game and levels feel a little more as something where you litteraly fight you way through, but with a handicap. It takes a little more time for each shot to fire and you only have six, then you have to reload. So every level you take your time, learn where the guards are and patrol. And then figure out how to beat the level, because if you want to go all guns blazing, you will click restart ALOT. Unfortunately the game suffers from a little bad programming. My game crashed for different reasons alot. With no fix that worked, that took away the flow of the gameplay and some of the fun. With better programming this would have gotten a higher grade. 6.7/10",1
"The innocent, almost boring beginning transforms into a surrealistic, deeply psychological drama -- and it uses YOU as its art material. I can't get enough of games of this kind.",1
doesn't work andSEGA doesn't plan on fixing it.,-1
"A awesome stratagetic game that truely gives a good experience to anyone who plays it (most of the time at least). Amazing graphics and gameplay. Great mechanics that change the game hugely. IMO Dota 2 is much, much harder to play than LoL. Great game, infinite limit of gamplay, but very hard to master.",1
"9/10 as a Stealth/Action Title, 4/10 as a Hitman Title.  However, this game makes up for the lesser Hitman style by adding a Contracts mode which is brilliant and makes it a relativly good addition to the series.  The bottom line is, If you want a good stealth/action title with beautiful graphics get this. But if you want a real Hitman game, get Hitman: Blood Money!",1
There are quite a few total conversion mods for this game; which makes it like a new game everytime!   -A Clash of Kings (Game of Thrones) -Genkokujo (Feudal Japan) -Last Days of the Third Age (Lord of the Rings) -L'Aigle (1805 Europe) And many more!,1
"This was my first experience with Eidos Hitman series. I liked the concept and dived in when the game was on special. Fairly predictable on rails type of shooter. The suspect level indicator seems random, even when in disguise. Play stealth or rage with mixed results. The controls and cover system are basic and there are limited exploration incentives. Average graphics (2002). Score: 6/10 wait till its on special.",1
There's so much to say about this game but I'll leave it at this: It's easily one of the best RPGs ever made.,1
"This game is, in my opinion, a future classic. Not that there aren't any nitpicks, but overall, this game is pretty solid. I have played through this game twice, once on Medium, once on Hard. In the future, I might try 1999 mode, which is the hardest mode after Hard, and is only unlocked after beating Medium mode. Overall, I'd say there is a definite challenge, but I'd recommend heading straight to Medium mode.   Pros:  +Elizabeth. What can be said that hasn't already been said? Usually, a video game ally requires that you keep them alive, and are usually very stupid and bumbling. But Liz is fantastic. Not only is she always safe, but she's also crucial to the plot, and, most importantly, she throws you ammo, salts, and health during fights. This is important in two ways: 1) it keeps you fighting longer, without dying (because dying, in this game, is worth money), and 2) makes her important. When she's no around, you actually miss her, wish that she were there, because she's absent from the field, and therefore not there adding to the plot and giving you supplies. This is very smart. By making her useful, you become attracted to her. By making you invested in the character, you actually feel a sense of urgency and necessity to getting her back (as she does disappear from time to time). This makes finding her an actual desire, rather than a chore, and therefore investing your attention. Also, I thank 4K for not making Liz a love interest. Even though she is attractive (and wears some low-cut shirts later in the game), she and Booker never have any attraction between them; it's just a matter of business, and, later, friendship. This is a fantastic move, away from other triple-A titles of recent years, whose crutch is a busty, attractive female character whose sole purpose is to simply exist as an attractive woman, rather than a useful, interesting, friendly person like Liz. +Even on low graphic settings, the vistas and views from the flying barges and skylines are spectacular. Seeing the misty clouds, floating buildings, and the sun filtering through the trees is pretty darn cool. I'm not sure how great the improvement is to max graphics settings, but that's for others to decide. +Sounds, guns are punchy and entertaining. Everything feels explosive and action-packed. There's nothing more invigorating than flying around, shooting your foes with a carbine, or taking down a heavy with your RPG. It's unbelievably fun. +Gear system is a new addition to the 'Bioshock' series; you can equip clothes, or 'gear', that you can find in locked rooms and hidden places. A hat, for example, may give you the ability to light enemies on fire when you Skyline-Strike them. Or a pair of lovely pants that refill your health when you respawn. The cosmetics don't alter your appearence, however, and are simply stats. Also, I swear that in my two play-throughs, I found different cosmetics, and missed some I'd already found, giving greater variety to the system. [Notice: I've encountered a strange glitch involving a certain hat, which, upon equipping, crashes my game. It's very strange, not sure if anyone else has this issue, but not an error that ruins the game] +The story is fantastic. It is able to talk about contemporary topics of the 1910's in a non-subjective way that allows the player to think for themselves, and make their own moral decisions. The story is well played out, paced well, and fairly interesting. Definitely one of my favorite plots of all time.    Cons:  -Vigors are useless. They're useful in a few places, and they're an absolute riot to use, even more so than the older games. But unlike the original games, wherein the plasmids were useful not only for taking down or stunning enemies but to also open areas and clear atmospheric obstacles, the vigors serve no purpose other than killing foes and opening something specific to the game's storytelling. I found that, in my initial play-through, every firefight could be just as easily won through bullets as with combined arms. Unlike in the original games, where bullets are expensive and hard to come by, ammo and money are literally  everywhere , so you're almost never out of cash to spend on ammunition for your shotgun. -The boss fights are really annoying. Have you ever hated game bosses where they simply lock you in a condfined space and tell you to just kill a ton of dudes? That's every boss in this game. -Enemies are pretty boring. 90% of the time, you'll spend your time fighting plain humans, although with assorted weapons. The special enemies, such as the 'Firemen', 'Motorized Patriots', 'Boys of Silence', 'Crow' and 'Handyman', are rather interesting, and each require a different strategy to beat. For example, you can take the vigor you receive later in the game, the 'Return to Sender', to catch the Fireman's bombs and whip them back at him. However, but there aren't enough of them for it to feel fun.  -The game lacks a lot of the scary elements of the original games, trading in terror at sea for high-flying shooting in the sky. -There are many more guns than in the previous games, but half of the guns are simply the same thing as the other half (one half are the regular weapons, the other half are 'Vox Populi' remakes, with slightly different stats). -Unlike in the previous games, you can only carry two weapons at a time, and all of your vigors, as compared to the first game (which allowed you to carry all of your weapons at once). This makes some firefights hard, and you have to plan to carry one short-range, one long-range gun (i.e. a shotgun and a carbine).  -One aspect of the original games that made combat interesting that was left out of this game was the different ammo types, which allowed you to have certain bullets that deal with heavy armor rather than flesh. I missed this in 'Bioshock: Infinite'. -The game offers, in a few places, decisions over whether to choose a specific action or not. However, after playing the game again, I came to the conclusion that the decisions did not actually matter (as in, they didn’t hold any bearing on the ending, such as the first two 'Bioshock' games did with the collection of 'Little Sisters' on the good/neutral/bad ending).   Final Verdict:  I enjoyed this game, as evident in my 25+ hours playing the game twice. There are definitely some things I didn’t approve of, such as the low weapon inventory, expensive revivals, too few good enemies, and uninspired vigors. But overall, the thrill of flying along the skyline, firing my pistol on the guards below, jumping down on the enemies with a skyline strike, makes it a pretty fun game. It may be one of my favorite games, but it's not my absolute favorite.  My biggest note about this game was the feeling I encountered after I finished it; it didn't feel like a 'Bioshock' game. I have not played the second game in the series, but I felt fairly familiar with the plot and atmosphere of the first. Whereas the first game was about searching for every scrap of ammo and health, trying to save yourself from the splicers and other insane inmates of Rapture's sunken Hell, 'Bioshock: Infinite' is about high-flying action. There's no premise of survival, simply enjoying the ride and unlocking the secrets of Columbia. They're different game types, they emphasize different strategies, and they vary in styles. They're so different, except for their references, that I couldn't tell they were related. This doesn't mean they're bad. They're both  fantastic . Point made.   Verdict: 9/10 ",1
Better than Hearthstone tbh,1
This game is Gold with steam in it. If you like coop steampunk piloting zepplin shooting big artillery... well look no further :) Its graphically beautiful and gameplaywise you need to focus a bit to perform,1
This game ♥♥♥♥ed me up.,1
Is gud gaem. the pressure in this game is like someone playing a piano and afraid to make one little mistake thats why i play it while listening to piano solos lmao,1
"Amazingly fun multiplayer simple short round action. I played locally with 3 players / controllers, and it worked great. This is basically a new sub-genre of fighting games. There are no long button combo chains like in traditional fighting games (which I hate). It's simple, more so than Towerfall even, but it's a blast.",1
    So boring,-1
Good game for play with friends :D,1
nice game ever,1
"Think Diablo 2 is the best game ever? Think Diablo 3 isn't dark enough or you don't want to pay for it? Then Path of the Exile was made for you.  It's a top down, hack 'n' slash RPG with all that usually entails. There's nothing fresh or innovative here but if you want a simple, XP grinding, multi-player loot-fest, then this is a solid bet.  It also has the advantage that free-to-play, doesn't mean pay-to-win, as the pay for items and upgrades are almost all cosmetic.",1
"You have to break this game down into 2 parts:  1) the gunplay levels are really shoddy and play like a 'my first stealth' game.  2) Conversations and choices are great. If you like choices that acutally affect things, this is it. The end boss can change, who helps you can change, who dies, etc. Well worth the muddled action parts, i'm not kidding. (also the first place i saw the 'run out of time' convo picker thing)",1
"What a great game, download now free",1
The only games with more DLC are Train Simulators.,1
"raiting: 4*. we need admins more active, scams are everywhere and moderators/admins arent doing EH-KNEE-THING about it! plus a different way to find hats and clothes WITHOUT using cubits besides giveaways.  Pros: -large variety of stuff -PvP usually is'nt in this kind of game -easy daily cubit quests -lots of perks  Cons: -no way to find most clothing, you have to buy it. -very slow leveling -TONS of scammers",1
"What a twisted reimagining of Alice in Wonderland. Intriguing plot, creative environments and despicable characters. The hack and slash does get a little repetitive and some of the chapters do drag but overall, a really fascinating game.",1
"One of the best co-op games ever, even if a bit repetetive. Cash is king.",1
"I guess I could say that it's a nice game.  -Very bright, vibrant colours and style -Nice combat -Wide variety of apparel -A wide range of many enemies, mini-bosses and bosses -And a wide range of weapons to fight them off  Overall, i like this games style and how it plays out, and if you're looking for a decent 8-bit MMO-RPG I would say choose this one. 7/10",1

Don't act dumb.  edit: game got absolutely messed up by cash grab developers SWEDEN YES,-1
  Storyline is more developed than my relationship skills,1
Great simulator you need teamwork and communication to defeat the enemy team. One thing I did like about this than Arma was the medical system.,1

"I didn't know if I would like this or not, but it ended up surprising me how good it was. It's quick to play to the finish and has a good story with solid puzzles throughout to keep it interesting.  The music is also excellent; any fear or anxiety I felt through playing was because of the music.",1
"Love the new heroes, even as a veteran quite punishing.",1
This is easily one of the best games I have ever played and even now its still in my top 10 list. Total War Shogun 2 is the best recent Total War game. Will get to Rome 2 with upgraded PC. Creative Assenbly VICTOR!!!,1
"I wish it was not all timed, Would rather relax and play the game at a slower pace. Just want to play the game and not be stressed to get it done. I have enough stress.",1
"-Foundation of a city -Population growth -Plopping schools, police stations, healthcare facilities and such -Population happiness grows -Dr. Vu arrives and pays me to use a fire engine to hose down cats stuck in trees and sell mind control ice cream to children -City now hates me and I am excommunicated  5/7 would be excommunicated again",1
"Portal 2 may very well be the magnum opus of Valve's creations, along with Half-Life 2. Portal 2 took everything that was good about the first game, improved on it, and added even more new game elements such as gel and the gravity tunnels. The gel was a lot of fun to mess around with and the gravity belts made puzzles all the more complex.  Though the best improvement in my opinion would have to be the Characters. Instead of the monotone GLaDOS from the original Portal we get a much more characterized GLaDOS, especially after Chapter 5    when Wheatley turns GLaDOS into a potato   . Wheatley and was such an enjoyable addition to this game with his cockney accent and great sense of humor. J.K. Simmons as Cave Johnson was a lot of fun too.  Overall I have enjoyed Portal 2 far more than the original Portal, which only took 3 hours to beat for the first time (original Porta is still a good game, just too short). This is definitely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, and I haven't even started on co-op or community levels.  Story 10/10 Gameplay 11/10 Graphics &amp; Visuals 10/10  This game is just so damn good if you have 20 bucks to spare just buy Portal 2. Everyone deserves the chance to play this marvelous game.",1
Should you buy this game? You know the answer already: Yes. It's a Fallout game.,1
"A good platforming/puzzle solving game. You can switch between a thief, mage, or knight at any time to solve different puzzles and fight. The graphics are outstanding, especially for an indie game. Probably the best graphics I've ever seen in a indie game, really high quality professional grade. Tight, responsive controls (I play with a wired xbox 360 controller), good sound, great gameplay, and just a really well made game that is a pleasure to look at and play. It's only downfall is that it is very short (6 hours or so). 8/10",1
"A game that is intended to be about a rocky relationship between a pair of high-school seniors as they progress through their lives. Well excecuted, and sometimes funny in the main story.  However.....  Going back to 2002 and picking any of the secret icons.  This game becomes ....  A. Valve References 2002: The Game: The Interactive Experience  B. Dank Meme Simulator 2002  C. JOHN CENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: The JOHNCENAperience 2002.  All around good game, even if I've spent more time on easter eggs than story.",1
"very linear and repetative but a fun game to play through apart from a glitch or two good graphics, ok storyline",1
"Nice game, it takes a while to get used to the low-res graphics and the UI is a bit unintuive but it's not bad overall. I've enjoyed playing it. 7/10",1
"Awesome game. Ambient game like Eufloria (41210). Great soundtrack list with stuff like Biosphere.  But for my liking it was to involving. I like Eufloria so much because it's a lot of downtime, so you can listen to the radio or watch a documentary AND play the game. That's a great mix for me. And Osmos despite being an awesome game, isn't like that. I still highly reccomend it though. It's well polished, cheap, fun and rewarding.",1
"terrible game, crashes alot and its such a pay to win it hurts.",-1
BEST GAEM OF THY YEAR!!,1
Don't have Garry's Mod? Too stupid to make pose animations in Garry's Mod? Get Source Filmmaker. You won't regret it.  I have been using Source Filmmaker for a while now and I understand the way of using the software. It may not be easy for starters but look on tutorials on YouTube or Google (Because they're your best friends) I still am kind of a newbie with this software!  But I will rate this a 9.8/10 Because I am still a noob and I learn something new everyday about this!,1
  Great game,1
This is gaming history in the making!20+ hours after starting and i still feel like i have done almost nothing in this huge world...The best part and what separates this game from others is that you love the fact that the game is huge and feels like never ending!!! I don't even like RPG's because of this factor(the huge never ending thing) but this IS and FEELS different! Cant recommended enough what ever the price! I would pay money only for the Gwent game even!!,1
"If you have ever watched Game of Thrones and wanted to play a game that puts you in the midst of a society that closely resembles the struggle of gaining recognition in a feudal age then this is a great game for you. It can seem daunting at first, and the game is not very forgiving of your mistakes, but crushing entire armies with trained soldiers under your banner feels good man. Also, there is even a Game of Thrones mod to add the factions from the show, which is pretty fun!",1
"Very good game in all modes - split screen (very rare today), local and online. Challenging but balanced, even young kids can play in local mode without frustration. Controller is highly recommended but game is still very playable with keyboard and mouse. Will run on new notebooks with integrated video (40 FPS, 1280x1024 high details, 33 FPS 1920x1080, high performance). Streams fine with SHIELD tablet  Drawbacks are minor and easy to live with: 1. Multiple controllers are highly recommended to play properly 2. Looks like game tries to optimise performance and sets resolution limit depending on hardware, need to change it 3. Split screen for more than 2 players not very playable even on 1900x1080",1
The game overall is actually really fun. It's a good 3v3 game .Yes it can be bs sometimes but if you look past that it is really fun. Internet connection plays a major roll in ths because if one person lags then it might ruin the game for one team. It is also a really good game if you have friends to play with. They have fixed my biggest complaint which is Rage Switching. (leaving a game and coming back with a different character) Yes maybe the Matchmaking system 'messes' up sometimes but i don't get those problems. About 12 characters to play so you have a option to pick from. just finding out the team comps and what characters to play/not play togethor might be the part that can win/lose a game. Like i said overall it is a really fun game. 8/10 if it's on sale i would buy it espically if you have friends to play with. just the thing people complain about when they first buy it is that there is no learing curve for it. if you join a match you can get owned. so actaully give the game a few chances before saying it was a 'waste' of money.,1
"Fun to play with friends, otherwise boring alone. It's a much more chill type of zombie killing than Killing Floor, where headshots, gun types and strategy planning don't matter so much. I know people who love L4D2 and hate KF and that's fine; we are all entitled to our own opinion. Personally, I can't play this game for as long as I can with KF.",-1
10/10  Buy it. Why not? You just need a few money and then you can get and 'play' the best beautiful girl in the world.,1
"Waaaw, awesome ... the story was compelling, the puzzles solvable but not too easy... hat off for the dev / story team",1
One of the best games ever!,1
"Very addictive, just could not help but kept playing.  It looked simple, but yet hard. At times you thought you could get a very good rating and review on the game you have created, however it was not how it went.  Still trying very hard to create the perfect 10 game. Good luck then.",1
This Game was the greatest game after Guild Wars i ever played!,1
I like this game,1
"Yeah, don't bother. Get Hearts of Iron 2 instead. This game blows goats nads.",-1
"The game starts off with a great opening. A good way to introduce the basic movement and controls, easing into the free reign exploration without making the player go through long tedious tutorials. The story premise and foreshadowing was at first engaging and did well to draw the player (or at least myself) into the story. After the prologue however things quickly nose diive.  The sheer amount of recycled content was insulting. From repeat fgihts with slightly skinned differences to outright repetition (dream vs actually happening ship battles) most of the game felt as if there was no creative mind behind it. The story ended up rushed and in the end it seemed as if the game designers wanted it to be done even more than the players. The 'boss' fight at the end was also an extreme let down. Frankly, I had a lot more fun fighting Mara in the previous game.   The story sucked, outright. Great premise, great idea, but a horrible execution. All of that could be forgiven if it was at least fun to play, but sadly, it was just boring. Even an old school hack and slash game is more entertaining than this. Character developement is also extremely limited. There is very little if any real reason to upgrade more than one stat, based entirely upon your playing preference of course. The varying skills all cap out at a flat 100 rating (105 with items). The level up is handled very poorly with various permanent effect potions affecting the total amount of points needed to upgrade. (bascially it costs x points at level 50 to go to 55, but use a +5 potion and you won't have enough points.. free level sorta, but now it costs more to keep going. This creates a sort of optimum level barrier that depends on the number of potions you can find/craft. I won't say it's detrimental, but it's certainly annoying.)   Minor detrimental points also abound, from dialog errors, to quests that jump ahead before you get them, to the wonderous fall damage that can occur if you go off the beaten path (I mean falling through objects). Give me the first Risen over this anyday. I whole heartedly cannot recommend this game to anyone. I would say avoid. If you're a fan of the mechanics or the 'story' of the Risen world, give it a shot.. but othewise, avoid. Sadly, there's really nothing for most people in the game.  ** Last note: Risen 2 introduced a foul mouthed gnome. Sadly, he seemed to have tempered his tongue a bit in Risen 3, limiting his swearing, but he's still the only good point in the whole game.",-1
"Rythmn games have had a huge part in my gaming experience because i have always love how music flows and following beats. This game allowed me to continue that 'fad'  I love how this game runs and flows yet the stuttering of objects as they pass can cause eye strain if playing for long amounts of time. Taking short breaks can solve this. I feel that the animations could be a bit smoother and the 'hold' objects maybe more detailed instead of two black bars, but for a new game everything works great and im loving it!  Some songs I enjoyed Feint-Shatter Netsky-Iron heart Fatboy Slim- Let the bass kick in miami  Overall rating? 8/10",1
"I will have to admit that this game is not as interesting as far as the combat system is considered when compared to the original Agarest. The storyline seems to be sticking to the original theme:  1. Be a god. 2. Find hot chicks. 3. Make babies.  The game still has plenty of endearing qualities, and I would recommend it if you are a fan of the JRPG genre, but I wouldn't say it is an improvement in my opinion over the original. In fact, I would go as far to say that the game seems a bit more grindy than most JRPG's. It saddens me, but I still need my RPG fix. So, it will do.",1
Haven't played a COD this good since MW2.,1

Has always been a favorite of mine,1

"When I first got this game, there were more players than there originally were. Nowadays, there are only 5 or less people on a single server, and it would sometimes be rare to find a server with more than that amount.   But sometimes, I wonder, what went wrong with this game?  The game has an amazing concept, that's for sure. The idea of dueling using a variety of combo's is certaintly intresting, with the community having to study each move a character makes carefully, to figure out what is the best one. It also looks a bit nice, as you watch your fighter gracefully execute their moves in a strong fashion.   But what I think went wrong with this game is that it simply unfinished.  Right now, there are only 5 characters to choose from, each with their own style with a variety of weapons to pick. But the issue here is, there isn't really much to do other than duel other people. Sure fighting other people is fun, but what else is there? Yeah there are other modes, but what else? The main thing here is   what else?   There are only about 3 modes to choose from, while the developers rarely provide updates for the game. This is more of a game to play once in a while, maybe with your friends or with other people, and that's that.  However,  I do think this is an alright game, despite its flaws. But I simply cannot reccommend this game, with its community abandoning the game, the lack of modes, and the dev's not really supporting this game at a fast rate.  Unless you've got some friends to play with, I suggest to buy this game when it's heavily discounted.  Edit, Nov 23 2016: I've checked out the store page of this game to see if anything has changed and to my surprise, this game is now around $5 CAN when it was originally around $15 CAN at the time of this review. Although I still stand by my criticism, I can suggest that due to its price, you wouldn't have to wait for a giant discount on this game.   But, like I've said previously, only a few people play this game nowadays; it's best to pick it up when you have a bunch of friends joining the fun along side you.",-1
GREAT GAME !      (if you have pacience),1
Great team class-based FPS with extensive character and weapon customization and a unique movement system which allows you to vault over obstacles and slide on the ground.,1

"Very cool, relaxing game with the right amount of challenge. Sure it could use some extra content and a better pathfinding but that's just me being picky. An excellent city building experience.",1
"I honestly can't recommend this game because I've never been able to finish a single game through no fault of my own. Either the AI breaks or the simulation slows to a crawl making the game unplayable. I love this game but even after several updates, the end game is inaccessible to myself and many other players.  I'll change this review if these things ever get fixed.",-1

"Yes! Doom 3 becomes a little bit more Epic. Well what is different now? The Graphics are a little bit better, more Bloom, more features and the Environment makes more Point now and the Story is telling more detailed. And at all, the Doom 3: BFG Edition Includes the Resurection of Evil Campaign and the best of all, it includes Doom 1 and 2 and some DLC´s about Doom 1/2. A Plus more, the Soundeffects are better.",1
"Overall super fun. Good online multiplayer, but this game really deserves to be played on a couch, with a ton of people and beers.",1
Dino D-Day has three Ds in its title because it is a 3d game and all 3 of the Ds refer to common themes and motifs found in the game you will find dinosaurs and Ds and days I give it five out of five its a masterpiece I mean come on dinosaurs are great,1
"Normally I mess around with reviews but I'm gonna be honest for this one.  It's not that good. I pre ordered it for $59.99 so getting a game that finishes up pretty quickly is dissapointing, that being said there is more problems with this game that hilariously ♥♥♥♥s up everything the series has done right.  Con: - 2 Weapon limit system - No real reason to roam/scavage the area as everything (yes power to the people is gone now) is run on cash. - Death is not really a consequence in this game, so start it up at hard. - Very few plasmids unique to this game. - Very little reason to experiment weapon/plasmid wise since you will rely on the same two weapons throughout the game (why get a new weapon when you invested money in upgrades?) and plasmids (same reason here, why use a new plasmid when you invested money in upgrades?). - Pop in textures are a plenty in this game. - DLC is a joke, so is the season pass. - No real replay value. - Handyman fights are a sick joke, ridiculously easy or hard depending on your weapon investments.  Pros. - Visually is great, sound track is good at times. - Rail shooting is nice, but isn't useful as much you want it to be.  How do you mess up the core element of a game series you have worked on for years, let alone have 2 games prior to this one with the same idea?  Simplified/10",-1
Pretty funny game until you missclick and die,1
"From what little I've played of this game so far, I LOVE it.    Graphics wise, we're talking 16x16-32x32px sprites running around in a gloomy yet somehow warm and welcomeing mass of castle hallways and rooms filled with a handfull of classic and a few non classic dungeon crawling creeps, overall all fairly aesthetically pleasing.    Sound wise, nothing to fancy. basic fx sounds, barrels and some enemies have a satisfieing crunsh to em'. The BGM pool have some gread medieval/fantasy esque tracks with this feeling of determination to keep pushing on to the end, very atmospheric and pleasing to the ear.    Gameplay wise, now this is where it get's fun, literally. the controls handle very smoothly and the killing, oh the killing. there's nothing more satisfing in this game than drawing the aggro of 100+ enemies only to turn around and rappid chain-lighting with a warlock setting off a combo and laying everything in the entire room to ashes.   Overlay wise, a nice and simple health/mana section displaying each player's money and deaths along with whateve potion you migt be carrieing simple yet appealing, but wait there's more. The mini map, this mini map makes me wet. it's only availible in overlay mode(see through, but layered ontop of the screen) but it's very understandable making you feel a little less lost in the expance of hallways, stairways, multiple floors connecting here and there, dead ends, secret passages and the occational puzzle   Over all, a very appealing game to the eyes and ears,   fun to play alone or with up to 3 friends (or strangers)   and very intuitive. 8.5/10 ;3",1
Wow!! This game is UNBELIEVEABLE !! FABULOUS GRAPHICS and STUNNING DETAIL!! Good game for the price and it even has CO-OP! That to me is the BEST PART! love playing with other guys against the ZEDS!!,1
"Team Indie's biggest flaw is that is a platformer with bad platforming. The level design is not terrible (of the few levels I played) but also bland and uninspired. The biggest problem with the platforming is the controls. First off if you're playing with a keyboard you'll have to make do with the arrow keys for movement instead of WASD and you'll be using D to jump. These controls can not be rebound. Secondly there seems to be input lag so that when you press jump the character will instead jump a few frames later, which can result in death.  Another general problem is the lack of options. As mentioned before your button imputs are unable to be rebound to what you prefer. In addition there are no graphics/performance options so if you're playing on an older machine you will have to make due with constant stuttering, slowdown, lag, and visual and gameplay glitches.",-1
You get Frames from the start of joining a server. America's Army..? More like America's Framy!,-1
A Brilliant game. Worth your time and money.,1
This game kept me intertained (sorry if i can't type) for hours and hours and hours! its a fun game i really liked it and i also cannot wait for the 1.4 update! and i also love the soundtrack and i hope the 1.4 update has more items and more bosses! (and npc's) but the one thing i love about this game is you can do anything! and its alike to minecraft! keep up the goodwork Devs! (psst hey i cant wait for the crossover update ;)),1
great game! simple gameplay with a some great ethic questions.,1
money grabbing milking machine full of script kiddies and insanely bad networking,-1
"It's like the ending of every war movie and game that made you cry was rolled into This War of Mine. And then I clicked 'End Day', and it got so much worse.  No seriously, this is one of the best war simulators I have ever played. It isn't easy, and there is no tutorial. Since when is there a tutorial for war?",1
Best RTS of all time,1
"Ok so as the (as far as I can see) first review for this game, the most important question to answer is it worth the money? well, yesss... but with a few caveats. Put simply, I don't think it is quite up to the price it is asking ($10 American at full price for me) but it is very close. Firstly, It is a good game. The artwork is really quite nice, which surprised me, because my initial reaction was to not like all the blue. However, as you go along, instead of getting sick of the artwork, it has enough variety to be interesting. Another factor is that everything is very clear. your character, the enemies, and all the projectiles stand out very well against the backdrop, and the backdrop is dynamic enough to not become boring. as of where I am currently (at the second boss, who I have versed but not beaten yet), I have only seen a few primary colours, or variants of them, but this isn't neccessarily a bad thing. Like I said before, the environment is dynamic enough that having little variance in colour isn't really a bad thing here, and it does have the benefit of making the game very clear. As for the sound, it's just like the graphics. There are several tracks in this game, and they don't really differ very much, at least from what I've experienced. However, they do set the mood for the game as a brooding, tense (but not dark) game. the music is perfectly sufficient for this game.  Next we have the controls. and there is nothing to complain about them. They are crisp and your character will stop on a dime. I haven't yet experienced a moment when I said to myself 'I didn't want to go there' unless it was my own fault. Now i must mention the game mechanics here, because they are directly related to the controls. The main game mechanic is that your character, instead of having a gun, has a sheild, and he/she/it will be shot at by a variety of enemies. Using the sheild, you can then bounce the enemies projectiles back at the enemies and kill them if you so desire. Aside from the bosses, there is absolutely no need to kill anything. The sheild you carry spins around your character following your mouse. It works fine, and again, I have yet to had 'What was that?' moment that wasn't my fault. But aside from making things easier, there is absolutely no need to kill the enemies. Your entire goal is to get to the end-zone without dieing (its a one hit kill mechanic both for you and your enemies, except the bosses). You can run through the levels without killing a single enemies. the only reward for killing enemies is the (occasional) powerup, which give you temporary abilities like being able to shoot, invulnerability, or causing an explosion that kills enemies around you, but not you. In my experience however, the powerups seem to be a little to short to be much use and not worth going out of your way for. Very occasionally they will save you, but usually they aren't worth to much. Another thing to consider when buying this title, is that there isn't a story. All enjoyment is to be found in the game itself, and there is quite a bit to be found there. In my experience I have had a quite a few moments when I've been pumped to get to the end of a particularly annoying zone, or blocking a shot i didn't quite see coming, and of course some very frustrating moments when i would mistakenly bounce a projectile into a wall and it would bounce straight back at me. A final note when considering this game, note that at first you are restricted to moving in only two directions. However, after the first boss, the levels open up and you are able to move in four directions. The path is always linear, and you will always know what direction you need to go. To summarise, I think this is a good game, everything is sufficient for what it does, and I cant find any major faults for this game. However, I do not think this game is quite worth $10 American. In my opinion it appears to be worth around to $6-7 mark, any lower and I would be happy to grab it.",1
"Best Free to Play ever , i am very sorry i have no time to write down all arguments. it would be a full book. awesome realism , graphic, fun , that s all i have for you now you don t risk nothing to try thoo, it s free to play  Some complain it s pay to win. well. no one ever said it s free to win, it s free to play ! and you have lots of fun whenever you win or lose",1

"Positively awesome UI, grand strategy, and I enjoy the chain events. As the year progresses I believe the upcoming updates and DLCs will make it even beter.",1
"Possibly the most amazing Action RPG, and videogame in general, that I've ever played. This game really has it all: A story that makes you care, gameplay that keeps you excited and entertained, beautiful artstyle that pulls you into a different reality, and a just absolutely phenomenal soundtrack.  The game's setting is the ruins of a once great civilization, Caelondia. You play as The Kid, while your every expedition is narrated by a man who knew this great city. His narration reveals more about the life of this world, and slowly you begin to understand what happened, and why. The Kid also has a history here that is revealed in parts by the narrator, along with other characters you will encounter, provided you take on optional challenges. And you really enjoy hearing these stories. They're gritty, heartbreaking, and you'll find yourself caring for these people, and finding a real purpose as you try to rebuild what you can.  The gameplay can be simply described as a fast-paced Action RPG. But it's much more fun to expand on what they do here. The RPG mechanics are very horizontal and customizable all the way to the late game, which while some diehard RPG fans might detest such a thing, it's really, really fun. REALLY fun. You'll amass a considerable amount of weapons, all of which can be upgraded, and which will allow very different playstyles. On top of this there's also special skills for combat that can allow for some really exciting saves when you're in a tense situation. There's also plenty of other gameplay modifying features in way of upgrades to different stats or inventory with fantastical alcoholic beverages, as well as challenge conditions involving some cold-hearted gods. And this game can get hard, especially if you use all the aforementioned challenges. It becomes tense, and somewhat frustrating, yet it feels worth it because you start to feel like a warrior out of some epic saga.  This game's visuals are pretty. They make you feel like you're in a really epic, extremely magical fantasy world. And the cultures and world they display looking vibrant and living despite the post-apocalyptic, rather dead status they're in. You explore massive ruins of what was clearly a great and powerful civilization, and by just looking at it you can see it was something lively and thrilling.  Lastly, I need to cover the music in this game. It is the best videogame music I have ever heard. Every song in this game is great. They excited me, and made me build a deep emotional connection with the game. You go through a variety of environments in this game, and different music will play in different areas and situations. Music that fits so well it may seem as if this world itself created the music merely by existing. And if you own the soundtrack, you'll be brought back to this world and these environments every time you hear the songs. The composer, Darren Korb, has clearly made something very magical here.  Overall, Bastion is a solid, utterly fascinating game that you'll sink hours into by playing over and over. I highly recommend it to every gamer. Even those who might not like the genre will probably find a lot to like from this game. It is simply amazing.",1

"This review comes from me having played this when it came out in 2007, and beaten twice so my Steam hours don't do it justice. __________________________________________________________________________________________   If you had ever played a role-playing game before The Witcher came out, chances are that most of the game involved people asking you to go places, deliver items, and kill things. Then this little beauty was born.  After the Witcher 3 came out and caught everybody's attention, many people who haven't played the series end up asking the question 'should I play the first two games in the series?'. Inevitably, many people will recommend playing The Witcher 2: a great game with solid controls and outstanding visuals. And what visuals they were, able to bring the gaming rigs (at the time) to their knees.  While I'd agree with all of that, I'd also add that everyone should play the first game, because I found it to be one of the best RPGs of all time. It is, through and through, a true RPG. One that focuses on choice and the resulting consequence, rather than character building etc.  Usually in every conversation I have regarding The Witcher, someone always admits to quitting, usually due to the unique fighting mechanics or during the game's extensive swamp section. But because The Witcher is structured linearly, and it seems as though it was built that way, it results in a game that constantly gets better as the story progresses. The second act improves upon the first, the third improves upon the second and so on and so forth. Despite the game's initial awkwardness, it becomes apparent to the player that things are picking up and where a certain brilliance can be felt in the story. But it's the fourth act where the crescendo really occurs and is that which really makes The Witcher what it is, what it's meant to be.   Every moment in the act is interconnected in some way. Every character seems to have a relationship with every other character. And each character has a little quest for you, which in turn will all lead back to the original quest. It's a beautiful thing really. Alina and Julian are getting married, but Alina's taking care of Alvin, who leads you to the local hermit, who takes you back to the Lady of the Lake, who wants you to kill a monster in a particular way, and on it goes. The thing about these quests is that they are different in regards to other RPGs. Tasked with killing things in order to obtain items is fine, but it's a simple approach to a more full-filling one that these side quests can offer. The Witcher recognises that these games aren't so much about the skills players choose, but the choices you make. Each choice leads to a different outcome. And these choices are generally based off the player's view on matters, or how they feel, which makes the whole experience that much more authentic. Of course The Witcher is not unique in this regard, but it can certainly serve as a more refreshing approach to how RPGs should be made.   Convincing a ghost that she is, in fact, a ghost so as to help her pass on to the afterlife is not a quest that would be present in many games. Nor would a quest, such as the aforementioned, end with the main character participating in a poetic duel with a bard.  The Witcher isn't the most beautiful game, with its wonky animations and the odd poor texture here and there, making it incomparable to its successor The Witcher 2. The more I played, however, the more I found myself sucked in. You end up learning that ignoring side quests is not an option. You just have to see more, play more, experience more. The Witcher shows us that there can be more to RPGs than just fighting.  I, personally, thoroughly enjoyed the underlying themes in certain parts of the game. Act IV explores the different topics present in its story through the actions taken by the NPCs and the player. Two species with two different sides to the story. A ghost who isn't so much evil as it is misguided, and even in death it loves gambling so much that it tries to gamble for a human life. The monsters themselves seem to embody failed loves and desires. So much seems to be going on and somehow, through all the intricacy of the narrative, the clever role-playing ideas of the initial parts of the game are brought together in Act IV to form a cohesive statement about love and other things. Laying it all out, dissecting it, and examining it, resulting in a culmination of understanding.   So go ahead, do yourself a favour and pick it back up if you haven't already. Beat the game, and possibly end up having one of the best roleplaying experiences of your life. From Act IV onward. Or not. I don't mind.   Update 3/12/2016:  I've just discovered the OST and Inspired by soundtrack that come with the game. Seriously, such value for money. When on sale, it's $1.50. Outstanding.",1

"Awesome game! I love the scenary and graphics and works perfectly with a racing wheel! Also this game can get a bit boring after a while of looking at the same scenary, but overall and awesome game!",1
Game was kinda glitchy for me. Had to restart areas a couple of times. Checkpoint system is God awful. I saved and quit when was I was about halfway done with an area and then when I restarted later it put me back all the way at the beginning of the area. Ridiculous!,1
"DLC is a fun game, if a little short... or at least it's 'suppose' to be short, but word of warning right now - COLLECT ALL THE COINS YOU SEE! If, like me, you manage to somehow miss 14 coins you could end up running around for an hour trying to find them. This might not make sense right now, so early in a review, but if you play it you'll understand.  What DLC Quest does is capture the current state of AAA Games and makes a great social commentary (that's 'satire' to you and me) game out of it. The concept is simple, you're a player and you're in a gameworld, but everyday 'normal' abilities don't seem to be present... until you visit the DLC STORE! It's one of the true funny games I've played over the years and really manages to put the humor across nicely.  In terms of gameplay DLC Quest isn't too far removed from your 16-bit platform adventure games, so don't expect anything amazing or groundbreaking in that regard. However, the 'story' really makes this game something worth playing, if only to spot all the references and go 'ooooh yeah, I know that!'.   So if you have an hour or two spare and want a little break from the AAA-Games scene, and have a spare £1/$1 to your name than you could do far worse than buying DLC Quest. It's a game that is self aware and runs with it, providing funny moments along the way. Just collect those coins.",1
"I bought this game because I thought it was a good concept and had nice visuals. The thing is, it was executed so poorly beyond my expectations (and I wasn't even expecting much). There is no weapon balance. Katanas seem like the way to go because they're the only weapons with stupid passive abilities, as well as ridiculous damage output with the least amount of effort to even play. So if you are a katana user, stop. The servers are also poopoo, and for some reason there is a 1 hour tutorial for a straightforward game. This game should be free to play if they are going to include microtransactions. I'm not going to dish out $5 for a crappy game just to pay even more to unlock weapons.",-1

(I know it doesnt work like that, ♥♥♥♥ you)  Pros No Pay-To-Win model, only few transactions One of the better F2P first person shooter Loading is very fast Game is very populated Gun play is very good  Cons Some frame hiccups (very rare tho) Hackers (sometimes) Characters are somewhat 'Bullet-Spongey' Characters are 6$ (5.29 Euros) to 10$ (8.82 Euros) to unlock Some maps have very OP sniping/airstrike spots.    Overall Opinion",1
"This is a great game if you like the leisure pastime of playing games that don't require days and weeks of your life, particularly HOPAs, but really, really, really hate the Damsel storylines that are flooding the genre. I hope part II is a success and we finally see more games like that. Developers, please set us free from the candy unicorns!  I have played this game more than once and I really enjoy the story. It has twists and turns, you visit different places (with a purpose, not just for play time) and it actually makes sense, which is really hard to say for more than a handful of games. There are quite a few of us that await patiently the next part of the trilogy (patiently, for years I must add) and this is saying something.  It is not particularly gory, but it is scary. But you have to actually play it, if you skip everything and just rush the game you'll miss half the fun. The voice actors do a great job.  It run greatly on Vista, with a glitch or two on Win10. I would prefer it if I could lock the toolbar up.",1
"Since 2009 this game is in my opinion the best CO-OP Multiplayer Game. You got a very good balanced level system in it. 200000000 quintillion weapon,shields,granade mods and class mods. Also the humor of the game is quite funny ;) You should try it with your friends.",1
"It's not a bad game. Friend and I played the dungeon crawl together and had fun with it.  I've been doing the single player campaign and it's not bad. Movement took a little bit to get use to, but overal it's a pretty good game.   ",1

"Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 does exactly what it says on the box, giving you the experience of being a car mechanic. As a simulator it’s exceptionally well done, capturing many of the aspects of car repair whilst not being as unforgiving as its real world counterpart is. However some of the more interesting parts of the game are hidden behind the levelling system which is too basic and takes far too long to get anywhere meaningful making it very easy to put the game down and forget about it. I enjoyed my time with Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 however if you don’t have an interest in cars or simulator type games then you probably wouldn’t find much more to love in it.

"OMG I have been waiting for this for so long. My own Sandbox server with Wurm Unlimited, I love the fact you can customise the sandbox experience to suit you own play style rather than being tied down to someone else's idea of the way things should be. Wurm Online is too grindy for some and it only favours the hard core games but Wurm Unlmited brings this game to the masses.  Awesome!",1
"With no online multiplayer it falls short, when compared to similar games.",-1
"Looking at the Steam achievement comparison thing-o, I think I can say that I am probably one of the first people in the world to finish this game who wasn't a tester of some sort. It pulled me in...! So, whereas a lot of the reviews I've seen on this seem to just be reflecting the first hour / general ambience, this one will hopefully be a little more in-depth.  THE PROS  I really enjoyed the graphics, audio, and overall tone of the game. The noir tone delivers, and bouncing around the streets is enjoyable in itself. I like the revolver system - it's very creative, though I think the way it works will frustrate some people.  The music in particular is really excellent. Soaring horns and all that. It fits the mood perfectly, and feels done with a lot of love. I enjoyed a lot of the puzzles, and a few of them were really satisfying to solve in an old-school, what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-oh-wait-no-it-isn't kind of way.  I also think the writing is really well done. But that brings me to:  THE CONS  The way that the narrative and writing itself is presented is difficult to follow. Doesn't feel like it was extensively tested on people who were going in totally blind. Characters have conversations that make references to things you don't know about, the clues you look at seem to follow huge leaps of deduction that are confusing, and you generally spend a lot of the game wondering if you missed something. Apparently I hit a bug somewhere along the way, but truth be told I was a little uncertain about what was going on the entire time.  You'll understand the broad strokes of the plot, and the dialogue really is good (and funny!) but when you reach the end, and your characters recap the case you've just solved, I think you will be bewildered by the people and events they suddenly begin making extremely detailed reference to.  At the same time, I don't think it's the writing - I think it's the interface and the design. I think it's the way that the conversation and clues system works. If you're able to stop and read every clue right as you get it and really make a non-metroidvania-esque effort to follow along, you might have a different experience.  OVERALL  I would absolutely recommend Hot Tin Roof. It does noir atmosphere and metroidvania gameplay really well. If you liked Jazzpunk, this one is a no-brainer. The characters are endearing and the writing is enjoyable - it's just shortchanged a bit by the way it was implemented.  Have fun!",1

"Very interesting game indeed. The story isn't exactly detailed as your traverse the beautiful forests but it adds to the mysterious nature of the game. Combat is fun, using bows is always a pleasure for me and sneaking around was simple and effective. Sound was awesome, with eerie tones and listening for whispers was haunting and engaging. Graphics were amazing, lush forests and great color saturation (if you changed the color from black and white to color). Enemies were engaging but overall were not very difficult, although I don't believe they were supposed to be. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to play something mysterious with engaging first person combat. It's not very long, coming in around 6 and a half hours or so, more if you spend time looking for ever single chest, scrap of paper, etc. Don't expect a lot out of the ending with this one but it adds to the mystery. Definitely wait for it to go on sale, I paid $4 for it and felt I got my money's worth. I would say $5 and under for this one. Have fun!",1
This game is like heroin. 10/10.,1
"I backed this one on Kickstarter, mainly because there was a goal set to fund a Linux version and there was only a few games for Linux then. The idea sounded good – reviving an old classic, something like Fallout, multiple skills and ways to solve quests, etc.  After over two years of waiting it came. Playing it was tricky at first, due to a 'fog of war bug' on my integrated Intel GPU. It seems the problem was known from early beta but all the developers could say was 'Intel GPUs are not supported'. Oh… and I thought the game was supposed to be about story, playability and reviving classic. Nothing that should require a dedicated gaming hardware. Current laptop should be enough. And is enough when the workaround for the bug is known. But creators would not acknowledge that – buy a gaming computer or don't bother us.  OK, so with the workaround for the GPU bug the game was fun to play. There were some game bugs, sometime ruining some quests, but nothing making the game unplayable. I have played 60 hours… and got bored. 'Dozens of skills' really means 'many different ways to open containers' all the same containers all the time. It is a game of opening chests and safes. And digging holes.  Yes, there is also the combat and combat skills. You need good hand gun or sniper skills not to kill your own people by mistake… But there are also high explosives, which you need not skill to use at all. Always 100% hit chance, always 100% deterministic effects. How can it be? If not the price and availability explosives would be the most effecting and safest method of fight.  Then come the patches. Some bugs were fixed, often for parts I have already played and do not wish to come back. Some features were implemented. And you know what? Linux is not an equal platform now. Steam achievements were introduced two patches ago and they are 'Windows only'. Steam achievements! I could understand, that some advanced graphics or sound effects could be tricky to do in Linux, or that handling some exotic controller could be impossible. But the achievements?!  It is not that Wasteland 2 is a bad game or that my contribution was waste of money, but I am a bit disappointed and the game is not worth the 'user reviews' rating it has now.  BTW I got bored by Fallout 2 too, so if you really love this type of games you could probably ignore my opinion.",-1

"A true city builder in that Banished is all about planning &amp; efficiency. You could say playing Banished is 'Zen-like' because there is no overbearing external pressures - you are merely massaging your production systems for optimal output. But don't rest on your laurels - there is the ever present slow burning drain on your resources - you consume resources to live and build. If you fail to plan ahead your town will wither away: because you didn't store enough food, tools, or materials.   The first 100 citizens is an engaging challenge, but then it becomes repetitive - until you hit 300+ citizens when you start to struggle against the natural limits of expanding your large town.   Banished was developed by one man, and while I praise his talent, I can't ignore the following issues. The trading mechanic is very basic, but that is 'ok'. There is no stupid combat mechanic like in the Anno series, which is 'great'; The variety of external threats is still pretty good. The production &amp; building requirements are simple - which is bad, ok, or good depending on your love of complex systems (but this is a city builder game you are playing).   In comparison to the Anno series, Banished is very basic in many ways. Banished doesn't have the huge variety like in the Anno series (crop variety is not real variety). In Anno 2070 there are many ways to optimise your production because of the intricate production networks you create - but this is not possible in Banished (because it is all AI determined) - but this may be a good thing you prefer your city to be easily understandable.  I highly recommend Banished as a good introduction to city builders because of its almost elegant simplicity. When you get bored, which you may not, then try Anno 2070. ",1

"  Alan Wake is a very interesting of a game and can offer fun gameplay and an interesting plot. However some parts of the story don't make much sense because there wasn't enough information or it was too vague. But is still rather interesting. Alan Wake can offer a good challenge for those who seek one if you decide to bump up the difficulty.  There comes a point in the game it may seem repetitive and enemies just cycle non-stop. Making it switch to fun to not-so-fun. It could definitely use more of a dynamic battle sequence.  However overall is a fun game (at least for a while), but does fall flat on some points though.",1

"I was so hoping that this game would deliver and it does not :( I can only give the game a rating of 4/10. so disapointing.  I am a fan of the CIV games and this one fails in so many ways: Pros: 1) Graphics look good (if you like the style i do not) 2) it is a Civ game 3) I like the idea behind the governments cool concept poorly implemented.  Cons: 1) Graphics - the style feels like it is for tablets, low Poly count and overly large units and icons for the touch screen players. 2) The maps are tiny! The huge map is smaller than the Standard maps in Civ 5. 3) you cannot zoom out in the map overview (guessing it is to hide how small the map is) 4) The map for explored but out of site is hard to read and the art choice does nothing for me (overly complicated pencil sketch 5) Tech tree unfinished, by this i mean that the descriptions of teh individual techs are lacking, the background is uninspired and i have no idea what the numbers that appear at the bottom of the tech tree are for. 6) Culture tree - same as tech tree. 7) While i like the idea of tailoring the government style, it again feels unfinished, there are no images for the cards, just a colour. their is no commitment requried, everytime you get a new culture research stage you can change your government style for free. 8) Religion, as soon as you can create apostles you can max out the religion, no sense of developing your religion. 9) Diplomacy - as already mentioned the animation can not be bypassed without cancelling the whole interaction. the AI does nto seem to take into account your current situation when threats are made, identifying when promises are kept or broken keeps getting it wrong. I declared war onmyself 3 times in one game! 10) many little glitches, that should not have made it into the final game, an example I built two different buildings for the 3rd building in the religious district.   do do this start buildign with one religion, change the religion of the city and quick build the second building, you end up with a red exclamation mark and the two buildings overlapping, but yopu get the bonuses for both    11) The combat AI is terrible, I ecided to go for a domination victory on a small pangea map, as suliman i was able to capture all teh capital cities while still in the BC area, rather than defend their capital cities the AI sent all the forces to attack my capital, or atleast they left my attacking forces alone, then dissapeared when the city fell. The combat AI for the Apostiles is better than for the aremd forces, at leat they track down and attack enemy religios units. 12) game is too easy.  I will give this another 3 months before trying to play the game again, to see if it is playable, in the mean time i am going back to Civ 5",-1

"Plot? Decent. Dialogue? Cheesily funny. Fanservice? Good enough (but I wanted more XD). Game style? Can be a bit tricky (unless you're using a wide area attack weapon) Neptune moments?

Overall, from playing this game, this game can be quite funny (thanks to 4th wallbreaker Neptune) and have major arguments (over who is the best girl lmao). Besides that, I do recommend buying additional character DLCs to have a slightly wider choice for a good team. Can be a bit grindy as some bosses require a minimum level requirement to beat them easily (unless you got some decently OP weapons for your current level) but all in all, it is enjoyable with great music, well drawn scenes and awesome partner skill system. I do recommend this game if you enjoy a slightly grindy JRPG with beautiful girls.  P.S. Blanc, Plutia (DLC character) and Peashy (also DLC character) are my favourites. XP",1

The core mechanics of SOTS:THE PIT are fairly easy but after a few runs you begin to understand more and more of the mechanics and the game unfolds and unfolds. The game has this thing that the roguelike genre is best known for (besides the obvious stuff :D) the game gets complexer the more you play it. See, 4X games like EUROPA UNIVERSALIS 3 are overwhelmingly complex as soon as you start the game. But this game looks easy at the beginning but you soon realise that there is much more to learn. Before I start writing a 50 page essay about this wonderful roguelike I'm just going to say that this is the perfect game for roguelike-veterans and -newcomers!",1

"L.A. Noire involves breath taking graphics and structure of the story so that as you play it, You think that, you are watching a 1940's detective movie. The facial expressions (animated by real actors and 32 different cameras to get every possible angle of the expression) , will blow you away. A great mix of clue finding, interrogating, and action, make this a game that I for one, had trouble stepping away from.   The story line is intense and awe inspiring. A very recommended game for those who enjoy the action, adventure, and mystery genre. [9.5/10]",1
Bricking my pants the whole way....thats what I would have been doing if the game didn't crash when I wanted to eat the spoup on the tabletop. I must tell you all now....something funny is going on here....I feel like i'm being watched.,1
"A great idea but so poorly implemented. The screen doesnt even display in full screen, what did they make this for a calculator screen?  Worth a punt for maybe apound and no more, as i said this is a great idea but made my monkeys.",-1
Buy this game! You'll be GLaDOS u did so!,1
Loved it. Play it 14 hour straight through til the end,1
it's a very nice game.and verry addictive ,1
Keeps me playing for hours!,1
Very nice spin to the Civilization series. So many different ways to play thanks to the tech web and upgrade system.,1
"first game is truly amazing and addicting, i play it weekly its just that good. simple yet effective with a good timelining system",1
An extremely beautiful visual novel discussing relations with androids and important questions such as if they truly can have feelings. The end brought tears to my eyes.,1
"As all Hitman games, a bit short but awesome!",1
"I couldn't get it to run properly on Windows 10 and tried all fixes/patches suggested in the discussions. If you're going to sell a game on Steam, at least make sure it works without having to screw around with the game's files.",-1
"This game is short and sweet, much like I hope this review is. Is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons worth $15... probably not. However if you can get it on sale as I did I would highly recommend buying it. Do you like story based games with little to no challenge? Then this is the game for you. Do you like a game in which the characters actually have personalities? Then this game is for you. realistically Brothers won't take you longer than 2 hours to complete but even so one can play through the story multiple times in the hopes of getting 100% acheivements. Unless you're a person who is willing to do this it most definitely isn't worth your money unless purchased on sale. This game is accessible to all and is very likeable. I like cookies, The End.",1
"recommend for every horror fan. Same gameplay as Penumbra Overture,necrologue, black plague if u liked these games then this is a game for u",1
"This is the one of the best MMO games i ever played based on Dungeons and Dragons Dice System, if you are a fan of Pen and Paper Dungeons and Dragons i absolutely recomend that game for you, if you didnt try pen and paper after this game you will want to !",1
What once started as a Fun F2P NOT P2W game....soon turned into a mess. The powers that be Used the Pc platform to spring board into Ps4 and they never looked back. They left Pc players in the dust. It was a fun game with horrible company behind it.   It was painful to see such a cool game die the embarrassing way that it did. I will Never EVER support a game that has been touched by EoR.,-1
"Very laggy on my intel i2 4gb ram windows 8 pc, almost unplayerble, fps drops down to single digits  0/666420",-1
"I love this game. This port is trash.  Basically if you have windows 10, it'll be a crap shoot if it'll work or not. You might get into the game, but it only has keyboard controls. So you think plugging in a controller will help? Well, if running to the right forever is your version of help, then sure. Good luck using Xpadder. Sound is broken. FMVs are broken. The 'best' part of this port is that it's the PS1 version, not the DC, so enjoy muddy textures.  Go get it on gog, where it'll actually work, it's also a dollar less. If you have a DreamCast, find a copy for that instead.",-1
"From wonky controls and a bad camera to terrible menu set-ups and hilariously stupid companions, the only reason to ever play this game is for the trading cards.",-1
"Fun game to play with friends, get it for half off right now.",1
It's ok,1
"Being a fanatic player of Train Fever I was counting the days for Transport Fever. Very similar but better in many ways. But not perfect, there are some small issues I hope they will be resolved in time.  + Improved graphics, more realistic in close view.  + Richer game through new modes of transportation ships, airplanes, new and more complex industries. + Easier way to place tracks, crossings any kind you want almost like a road. + No more terrain issues when you place roads or tracks, it's really smooth now. + Really addictive gameplay, not easy to learn it but the more learn the game the more you discover and more complex networks you can create, it takes long time both real and gametime to connect half of everything in the map.  - Graphical glitches dirt roads are half visible the further you zoom out, only from real close they appear normally. Bridges look weird sometimes like one column has an empty horizontal space and other similar stuff. - Time runs too fast like Train Fever, a year goes quickly thus making trips like taking weeks or months. - Interface: everything is so tiny especially if you work on high resolutions and no option to change size, icons are hardly visible and buttons spreaded around screen, one main bar at bottom, which it could have been better designed. you have to alter between modes, some buttons are far away from each other, even after 2 days it's still confusing. - Text: When you want to name your lines, stops, stations you have only limited characters, so you have to cut words... Not possible to cut, copy, paste, select.  - Cities still very small. - Maps still weird, no seas just rivers and lakes along their path.  - Graphics while from close view they are great from distant view it's not good. Mountains are hardly visible because terrain is plain green no texture it's very smooth no shadows.  -/+ Many players complain about game mechanics how the routes work or the don't as they say so. They compare with TTD or other Rail games.  This game has fixed routes they are not dynamic that's how it works once you set it the train will always travel the exact route and it won't act smart to find alternative route. If there is another train it stops and waits untill it passes. This is good and bad, bad because you have to do everything manually and create your route very carefully with signals and waypoints, the good thing is that is unlike other games with dynamic routing the trains won't travel all around like lost sheeps making a mess with other routes. So LEARN how to create routes and place your signals at right points and support demand, cities are always where everything goes at the end so keep that in mind and check what they need.   Overall the game is great once you learn how to play you get addicted to it, it's not a simple game nor perfect. But the gameplay is so good I forgive some issues. I expect developers will fix and improve the game and many to expect from modders of course. It's gonna keep me busy for long time!",1
Guards don't see a zipline going across a courtyard delivering bags and security don't notice cameras broken in the security room.  10/10,1
"This game is amazing! It has great gameplay, from zooming around killing dirty ol space pirates, to mining for riches, or delivering cargo to and fro. The visuals on it are breathtaking, and the amount you can customize your ship is awesome too. I just made it out of the first sector, and I'm finding new enemies, a new guild to join and do quests for and new parts of the storyline. The one thing that I find the coolest is the amount and difference in ships. I started off with the basic little ship, it has like 4 broadside cannons and 2 turret placements. I saved up enough to buy the next one that had one more turret placement and thought 'holy crap, I am way stronger now'. Before I jumped sectors I had saved up for a half million dollar ship 'the barracuda', because it had very fast speed and manuverability, along with 5 turret slots. I thought I was the boss... and then I saw the ships in the next sector. This one I just saw costs 17 MILLION and has 13(!) broadside ports and 13(!) turret placements and is HUGE! Holy crap, time to do some more missions and save up to get one of those beasts. I have played for 16 hours as of this review, and I can see myself playing for many more hours to come. So worth the money!",1
"I've played this game for exactly 800 hours and it hasn't lost anything, and if anything, it gained so much more content.",1
"best indie game of 2011, really impressed when finishing the whole process.",1
Beautiful game. Amazing music and atmosphere. 100% recommended.,1
This game is Amazing.,1
"Fun for the first few hours. Gets exceedingly grindy towards the end to progress, which takes away all the casual fun.",-1
good game for strat type games. also when in high rank maybe add some feature where we can farm tickets or some kind of attendance reward but nevertheless great game.,1
"Pretty fun to play, I like the open world to adventure, fight, and play with your friends.",1
"PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ -  Pro: 1. If you like classic retro games, Pac-Man is for you. 2. It's a great game to fill time.  3. Different Levels 4. Different gamemodes 5. Really fun game!  Cons:  - There is no cons.   Overall :- A great classic game! I deffently recommend this game.",1
"Like all the Witcher games, this has a great storyline. One problem with this game however is the combat system. The later witchers have fixed this issue, but this being the first of the series, had it's share of issues. The graphics and gameplay were great for the time it come out. Despite the combat system issue, I would still recommend this game to get a better undertsanding of the Witcher history and storyline.",1
"gameplay - 8/10 graphics texture quality - 5/10 artwork - 9/10 immersive experience - 9.5/10  feels - 11/10    Hallucination - 5/7      on offer or not, get it.",1
"Gets pretty boring and stupid after a bit, pretty much camp 2 cities for weapons, sit there with friends and kill those who come by, loot and log off for a week. Go buy DayZ, or wait until H1Z1 comes out, it's going to be free.",-1
great free to play game,1
+Do you want trucking ? -yes +Do you have a wheel setup ? -Yes +Do you want to drive your truck ONLINE ? -YEs +Do you have Euro Truck Sim. 2 -NO +WTF are u waiting for ! Just Buy with discount !,1
"Though this game is challenging and expensive, I had a LOT of fun playing this",1
"Fun game,Plenty of cars,nice gameplay.Seems boring at first.Finish the first couple championships when you get plenty of money (around 200k) money gets earned fast.Then you can buy yourself a nice supercar and cruise with your friends and have fun.",1
"It's a good game, with new ideas in every level and a lot of secrets to find. But the concept is better used in some other games, as only a few elements are interactive in this one.",1
10/10 would buy again,1
"TL;DR: The Game has Balance Changes since 3 looks a bit better and Actually works on AMD graphics cards.  Working great I was a little scared since people hace said it has issues with AMD and I am not good at tinkering case and point I haven't played either of my Just cause games because my PC just Will not and I had to tech support my Final Fantasy Type 0 for a month.  As for the game? I love it but I also love league of legends so you are warned.  I feel like a lot of the ninjas that were ♥♥♥♥ tiered in the previous game are improved because of the weight of the characters just feels different then Storm 3. Neji feels faster, Rock Lee feels slower, Everything just seems a bit more balanced. Sure if you know what your doing your still gonna wreck kidsbut face it nobody knows what they are doing online so your probably going to slam dunk 90 hit Combo stream everyone who looks at you funny wondering what button is Substitution on the keyboard.  It's unplayable on the keyboard you have been warned You will spend 4 hours getting wrecked and will regret every moment.  ",1
"The best Mass Effect of the trilogy if you can overlook some of the jankiness. The overall story, sense of exploration and RPG elements set it apart from the sequels that were too simplistic and character focused.",1
"You may be thinking whether you should buy the game or not after the dissappointing Assassin's Creed 3. Trust me when I say, this is a huge step up from that game. The story has drastically improved and is such an incredible experience throughout the game, the gameplay has been improved and the combat system is as smooth as ever. The ship driving mechanics has been improved a lot and makes it easier to navigate during the naval combat. Every part of the game has been stepped up by Ubisoft since the failure of AC:3. Great game, would recommend to anyone who likes AC series and even the ones who don't.",1
"  You'll love this game! I mean who the hell doesn't want to shoot the undead? Or hit the ♥♥♥♥ outta big undead ♥♥♥♥♥es with a pan?   This game will teach you how to survive in a zombie appocalypse,How to survive with women when they moan just because they are injured?   You're basically gonna live the life of the people in the walking dead but you will use molotovs to burn your friends,use chainsaws to 1 hit every average zombie,run like a baws and make everyone rage.  What the ♥♥♥♥ing hell are you waiting for? Buy this game and play ♥♥♥♥♥!  ",1
"This is one of the most complicated FPS games to play, as in there are a lot of control you need to learn to make your character move around in a organized way. Once you learn them however, the games becomes very fun, and difficult. So if you dont like a challenge this game is not for you. Some parts of the campaign I had to try (on regular) at least 20-30 times. Im a decent FPS player but is like no other I've played.   The game itself is very nice to look at, albeit not as optimized as I would like to see. It is also very heavility CPU based. My OC 4790k hovers around 20-50% usage, sometimes going into the high 60s. I play on very high at 5760x1080 and get around 55-70 fps on average with 970 SLI.   The gameplay is very different then any other game. The audio and realism is very good. Sometimes you really think you are a soldier and get scared when you are walking and suddenly hear bullet impacts near you. The gunplay is also very hard and challenging. You have to really be slow and careful on where you are how you plan to engage the enemy. Because they are very good shots and you die very easily. So you have to be strategic in everything you do. Which can be really fun.   This also is not a non-stop action game. There is a lot of walking and exploring. This is like a COD polar opposite.   Mods and custom content really add to the replayability and fun of this game. The fun never stops when you have all of the steam workshop and a few friends to play with.   Some things did bother me and broke the realism for me. One being that a nice combat simulator like this with accurate gun behaviors and recoil doesnt even have 2 different reload animations for guns, or when reloading when not empty you don't get 30+1. Also there is not very good animation in this game, reload, talking, and some player animation is not very smooth or realistic in many cases.   Overall I give it a 8/10 for what it was planning/supposed to be and how I received it.",1
this is my new favorite game guys,1
"Very confusing to know what to research as all techs is new pretty much, it takes longer to know the impact of your decisions. Before you atleast knew some history to lean back on. Cool game but prepare to do more research before you learn how to play.",1
"Poker Night 2 is a poker game (big surprise there) set in the Inventory and features The Player (as you) engaging in a battle of wits and luck againist 4 famous characters from video games, TV and movies as well as a few others present in their company. These characters are Broke Samson from Venture Brothers, Sam from Sam &amp; Max, Ash from Army of Darkness and Claptrap from Borderlands as well as GLaDOS from Portal as dealer. Other characters present are Moxxi and Steve 'Hayoo!' from Borderlands, Max acompanying Sam and Reginald Van Winslow as propriator of the Inventory. The characters interaction and dialogue with each other as well as you are damn funny and anyone who is a fan of any of these character will find a lot of fun in this game. There is also insentive to play more than just for fun as you can win items for Team Fortress 2 and skins for Borderlands 2 but there is a problem with the game that hold everything else back. And that is that its not random (or at the very least doesn't feel random) when it comes to the cards dealt, it feel as if GLaDOS favours the AI so much so that it feels like cheating. If this hadn't been so freakent as it was for me then I would write it of as be having bad luck those times. But when it happens so often I lost track after 2 hours then something is wrong. Also to even unlock the chance to win a Bounty Challenge you have to complete three objectives, some are really annoying, so every time you get to that check that there isn't a really annoying challenge. If there is here is how to reset them (you have to do this directly not even play the hand that is avable) turn of the game at the start of the new tournament directly, the next time you start a tournament they reset. If you are going to buy this game for the items and skins then prepare for a lot of frustrations and what will feel like the 'random' card almost always favors the AI even when their chance of winning is less than 10%.  If however you just want to see these characters interact with each other in funny ways and don't care about the items for either Borderlands 2 or Team Fortress 2 then fine you can buy it, or watch their interaction in a YouTube video.  IF you buy it and win one of the bounties then I'd recommend trying out Team Fortress 2, which is free after all ...  And finally congratulations to TellTale Games, you made a game that I don't like (also congratluations to anyone who read this far down!).",-1
Ranked matchmaking is absolutely horrible. I feel punished after I play two or three good games. Pairs me (just a pro) with two rookies/semi-pros against two pros/vets and an expert for like the next ten matches. What the f*ck. Horrible experience. The game non-ranked is much more fun because it doesn't rubber band so hard.,1
Great Game new style to a survival game and one of my loved games that i play.,1
mosty amazing top down game ever so many combinations making the game more fun esspecialy when you get to the 'end game',1

Fun and innovative puzzle game that still holds great today and probably always will! The whole portal system is amazing to test your puzzle solving skills and GLaDOS just adds icing on the cake (pun intended).,1
the best game ever created!,1
"I've gotten 3/4 of the games achievements and I replayed the game a few times, and I gotta say that this game is really bad, such a dumb tumblrgirl concept. why would the developers think this game would be a good. It's really just your average ♥♥♥♥♥♥ depression-quest game. This game makes a mockery of people who have social anxiety. Thank god it's free, Save the space on you computer for another game.",-1
The game is very buggy and the price i got it for was a waste of money it was so buggy and incredibly glitchy that it crashed everytime i used it even with the support and reinstalling,-1
"This is a good brain-teaser game. The mechanics of the different kinds of blocks are introduced gradually, each with their own kinds of puzzles that they are used to solve. All of the levels have logical solutions, although some aren't obvious - thinking about how to make sure you keep as many blocks as you can in your inventory can be quite tricky! There are certainly some challenging moments, and a few achievements to get you thinking about certain levels in different ways.   All in all quite fun, and integrated with Steam Workshop if you want to keep the challenge going with user content. A word of advice - for some levels it might pay to step away from the computer and let your mind stew on it for while!",1
"absolutely awful dont waste your money, go buy a hobo a sandwhich or something if you have the urge to spend  minimal enemies with ♥♥♥♥ poor hitboxes and minimal (shity) weapons,  most of the 9 lvls have a small handful of enemies usualy no more than you can count on 2 hands (if you're lucky maybe your toes too!)  but dont worry about them! your main enemy is gravity! you will die from falling through the floor or the random holes in the utterly horrid level design more then you will even get touched by a block zombie  the music is quite possibly cancerous and there is no way to turn it off other than muting your tv or turning off your speakers. or can just wait &amp; enjoy the random breaks when the music just stops out of nowhere  and as a tip when you pause the menu does not pause anything at all you can still move!  Dead Bits should have been released as a work in progress but im pretty sure the devs washed their hands of this game a long time ago  -3/10",-1

"I expected great things after taking a look at a short gameplay video on youtube an reading some additional reviews, and ended up disappointed when I jumped in. I like the idea this game had however when I saw there was a nighttime and no way around it I was bothered. Minecraft Night time hurt my eyes, State of Decay night time is terrible on my eyes. I did not want to squint while playing a game. Night time drags too, I ended up just closing the game the very first night (ingame) and I probably wont be revisiting it anytime soon.",-1
"Great game, but the second part (Metro: Last Light) is a lot better for me. Overall 7/10. Would recommend.",1
You wouldn't think something so frustrating could be so strangely relaxing. There's some messed up Zen going on with this game.,1

"This is a fantastic game. The combat is insanely satisfying, and it's a rush when you confront captains. Highly recommended, and can't wait for a sequel!",1
One of the best story based game I played.,1
"This is a very fun game. It's challenging but accessible, varied, aesthetically pleasing... the works.  But I've played 19 minutes and experienced five fatal crashes. I can't in good conscience recommend a game that's basically a teaser for itself.  I hope this gets fixed, because it is a recent release and it has so much potential. With workshop support this could easily become one of my favourite games.",-1
"This game is pretty good... If you like a non-existent development team. The actual TF2 team must not play the ♥♥♥♥ing game at all, because they are completely oblivious to what the players want. They buffed the Phlog ffs. Until the TF2 team starts making some good ♥♥♥♥ing choices, play Overwatch.",-1
"Whats all the hate with this game? It is insanely fun and is nothing like anybody would have ever played before, the customisation for characters is fiddly but its still great just like Terraria. Also riding your ship around and hiring crew is so fun, you really get to know all of them and if one dies then you genuinally feel sad, for as cheap as £3.49 or £6.99 there is no reason to not buy this game. Nuff said.",1

"This game is one of the dopest games I've ever played and most certainly going to be one of my favorite games. Even though the graphics may not be the best but you know I'm not conplaining. You could also hear the turbo's spool and blow off valves, which was one of my favorite things in the game.",1
Pros: new characters new gameplay new skills new hub world new items and loads of new stuff.  Cons: loads of glitches especially in the hub world where you fall out the map which gets annoying.  In conclusion I give it a 8.9/10 definitely a 5 more minutes game,1
This is a great zombie apocalypse FPS. Hours packed full of enjoyment and satisfaction. Earning your Tier 6 is really an achievement.,1
"Hand of Fate is a card based RPG fighting game, where every game is different. the cards of an map is randomized and you get to choose where to go, and what to keep or throw away. i highly recomend this game if you like casuel/randomized 'mini game' based gameplay",1
This is simply the best strategy game I've ever came across. Runs a bit instable on higher graphic settings.,1
Sins is one of the most accessible and fun space strategy games out there. The hook here is the Real-Time gameplay vs turn base and the 4X elements blended in. The game does an amazing job at keeping things at slow enough tempo that you never feel like you're struggling to keep a pace of the game mechanics. The amazing fireworks that fly when fleets meet in battle are the frosting on this delicious RTS cake.,1

"I have used so much profanity while playing this game, some in anger some in laughter, yet I keep coming back for more.   Once you play through the tutorial you will be presented with an always changing platformer. Sometimes an easy level will be genereated and sometimes not so much. You will start weighing the options in your mind, 'Do I really need that extra money.. is it really worth it?'   The game is an exercise in patience, but I do really like it. If you enjoy platformers, this one is definitely worth a couple of bucks. It does seem to frequent the Steam sales as well, just saying..",1
woah. it's very fun when play with a friend. :) heheh,1
"It's a good game. The graphic is great,, the gameplay is packed with action especially when playing in a team. The story is a little weak. Got boring after a while.",-1
The game is awesome u must try this,1
A fun game - perhaps more entertaining to play with friends. Might become a little repetitive if alone - but all in all - a good beat'em up game which is refreshing to an otherwise stale genre.  Positives: + Cute art style adds immersion to the world + Decent upgrade system  Negatives(if any): - Can become repetitive - It is a flash game - you could play it on it's initial website newgrounds if you really want to without paying for the game.,1
"  This game is hella-fun. My kid can't put it down, and my wife got sucked in big time. It's not exactly a hardcore experience, but it's a great way to get used to the VR.",1
"Despite the graphical style, this brilliant side-scrolling puzzle game provides a real challenge, especially in the unlockable hard levels. The four environments introduce different puzzle elements and add a lot of variety to the game. I highly recommend it, especially at such a low price.",1

"Think modern day Assassins Creed but with more stealth and hardcore body disposals. If you like games where you have to think carefully who you kill, and not run around like a madman, slaughering everything, this game is for you!",1
"This was a seriously fun game. Plays like Assassins Creed but I had more fun with it. The 'Boss' goblins were always a surprise to run into, stealth was great to use, and the combat system was wonderful and had many options. The story was also interesting, it explored more of the universe if you're into the series. Overall I would give this game a 10/10, because I honestly had loads of fun and thats all that really matters when playing a game.",1
"I have played this game a couple years ago when it first came out, crappy graphics ill tell you that, but what do you expect from a 4 year old game? I really recommend it, it's as fun as the trailer says.",1

"Most of my one hour of playtime was simply to get the game to the opening menus without crashing and flickering. Then my system could barely manage 20 FPS, despite being at the lowest settings and 720p. Normally I don't give games bad reviews for bugs, and I'm sure the game itself is excellent. However, I believe this review is justified considering that the port was outsourced to a studio that already had a bad reputation, Iron Galaxy. I do believe that WB Games did the right thing by suspending sales, and I may come back later. Until then, I'll just take my refund. I am incredibly disappointed by both WB and Rocksteady.",-1

"Whilst I do not believe this game is quite as good Arkham City, I also believe that it has been severely underrated by most critics. If you want more of Arkham, and are willing to accept the difficulties that arise when one team of developers takes over from another, I'd say it was worth your money. It may not be Arkham City, but it is never the less both a damned good game and an experience worthy of the Arkham francise. The multiplayer is also a damned fine piece of work.",1

"RCT is an amazing game, but this steam port is trash. It takes a miracle to get the game to launch, and when it does, it crashes all the time. It is hard to have fun playing a game like this when you always have to worry about a game crash. Whenver I try to save the game, it crashes about 25% of the time. I have the same issues on both my desktop and laptop. The issues make it pretty much unplayable. When (hopefully not 'if') they fix the issues then this game will be worth every penny, but until then, DO NOT buy this game. You will spend more time getting it to work then you will actually play.",-1
"The highly-anticipated WH40K MMO third-person shooter at first I highly doubted due to the fact the developers behind it were mostly known for shovelware titles, and infamously known for also being the devs behind the Naughty Bear game. However as game development progressed, I was gradually dissuaded from having such a faithless outlook on the game, as they managed to deliver (by this point, although not as polished due to their publishers pulling the release date back to be much sooner) most of what they originally promised to include in the final release. The devs have been continually updating the game so the factions are more balanced and that more features work, less CTDs, better optimisation options, etc.   The only issue I am concerned of aside from how the devs will handle balance in future (as in most PvP-focused communities, there are always complaints, however absurd or reasonable they may be...), is the in-game store items purchased with money, versus the items purchased with the in-game currency appropriately dubbed requisition. Obviously, a pay-to-win model is not the priority, from what I've witnessed, as the difference in stats seem to be negligible for most items. I would prefer if it were just limited to aesthetic items, rather than weapons and gear as that would erase any disparity it could cause to PvP balance.   Overall, WH40K: Eternal Crusade has exceeded my expectations so far, and seems like it may have a fair future ahead of it, just so long as it grows the player-base and maintain their interest in the game. It's especially refreshing to see a 40K title that has not immediately lost the interest of, or greatly displeased a majority of the fans of the IP. Suppose it just goes to show that the 'road to disappointment' may be deceitfully less steep than it first appears in some scenarios. Also, this should go without saying; playing this game with friends is significantly more enjoyable than without.",1
"This game is alot like team fortress, with some aspects like the tanks from robocraft. altho this game is free, there are limts like you only can have 7 parts so you pretty much have to get basic 4/5 stars for this one",1

I tried to like this game, I really did. But this games is not a Rainbow Six I growed up with.   The potential of R6: Siege is huge but fails in tactical aspect to please COD generation...  As an old R6 fan, I would say to stay away from this game. Shame   Now when looking at it as non R6 fan, it's an average game 6.5/10.",-1
"I've been looking for something like this for a while. The intensity of Counter Strike, with the tactical playstyle of battlefield. Definitely worth picking up!",1
"I highly recommend Soulcaster I &amp; II as they are wonderful experiences and I found them quite fun!  I first played both games back in 2012 and finished them both. I was part of the beta test for the Steam release and additionally finished the first game three more times and second twice. I greatly enjoyed the games for their simplicity and also depth. I'm not sure I could put the games into a specific genre, however they remind me of a mix of tower defense, real-time strategy, and puzzle games. The simplicity of the games comes from only having three unique warrior types that can be summoned, only being able to have 3 - 5 warriors active at a time, and only one special attack.   While this may not sound like much, the depth of the game comes from the amount of combinations for placing the warriors and also what upgrades to purchase at the store. Unlike a typical tower defense game, you can recall your summoned warriors and place them elsewhere, which also restores their health, and both of these strategies are important to master on later levels.   The puzzle element comes from the levels themselves, where walls will crumble and new enemy portals will open unexpectedly. You will also have to decide the optimal order to trigger switches as they open portals sending waves of enemies at you. The extra challenge levels are also much more puzzle like as they often have limited resources, which requires figuring out specific strategies to complete them.   A play through of either game will be about two to three hours, with my fastest time just under 1.5 hours in Soulcaster 1. Finishing the game unlocks hard mode and the challenge rooms. I don't consider the game length to be a detriment to the experience and instead it means I am more likely to go back to playing them again given the low time commitment.  The music is also great and fits the game nicely.   I think the list of cons for these games will vary pretty widely by player, so I am not going to go into what I consider weaknesses. Instead I would encourage trying the games to see for yourself if you like them, which is a pretty low risk given the Steam refund policy and with the games being so short.",1

"It's moderately funny, but you're probably going to get more laughs out of a 20 minute sitcom. WASD and left click to open doors/pick up useless stuff are the only interaction. It's free, only 15 minute long, and I realize it's just a glorified tech demo, but I'm reviewing it as a game and as such it's just not very good.",-1
"How did one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns of all time turn into this shlop? I am a slow paced gamer. I like to waddle around and smell the pixels. I appreciate the acrylic backgrounds and beautifully voiced characters. This game may be categorized under 'puzzle games,' but if you play it for the puzzles, you would be far more entertained by Freddie Fish. Rather, this is more like a beautiful children's book about the perils of being a teenager and growing into adulthood-something all of us can relate to (Except bronies. Boom! Shots fired!). Yet, it failed miserably to live up to its potential. Rather than dwelling into the complexities of human emotion, the plotline fell apart like cottage cheese. The player was sent around doing meaningless tasks that did not in any shape, way, or form contribute to either the story or character development. Hastily built plothole bandaids were dumped like so much dog s*** onto the unsuspecting player. Every character's personality was rendered in glorious 2-D. Nobody was the least bit affected by the traumatization that they experienced. No explanation was given concerning the constant breaches of the fourth wall made by the omnipresent player. Needless to say, this was painful to play. My hopes have been dashed, and I am beyond disappointed with how long I waited for this game.",-1
"I can't even get past the first mission because of the poor combat mechanics. Since it's supposed to be an introduction into the game mechanics or something, I don't even want to know what's awaiting me. I feel sorry for those who payed the full price for the game. I'm glad I got it in a bundle, otherwise I'd be seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.",-1
"excellent game, always having you coming back for another jump. RNG and difficulty keeps each run fresh.",1
"This is a great game. Captures the play style you really want in a game. Open, with enough structure to make it work. Lots of 'oh $hit!' moments! I played Dead Island and found it to be close to what I wanted, Dying Light is dead on!  Great game!",1
Seriously creepy game.,1
"Been playing a few weeks now, and I dont understand some of the other players complaints.  Looks good (running on high settings) Controls are smooth easy to play in first or third person The voice acting most of the time is good The plot and stroy (If you follow the missions) is intresting enought for an mmo. Combat is diffrent depending on your frame, how ever the choices in frames (for F2P) offer all play styles.  I havent spent a dime on this game and I have good gear. 'Thumping' is fun, double if its a squad or platoon combat gets crazy.  'Instances' in this game are challenging and fun to navigate.  Oh, and the currency used in the pay store, can be earned with relative ease in game. Only the impatient will end up spending money.   Its free, give it a try.    Solid 8/10  ",1
"Walking Simulator. Seriously, within the first fiteen minutes of the game I must have spent ten of those walking in white nothingness after falling down a hole.   I really appreciate how this game tries to break the streak of modern games holding the player's hand and telling them everything they need to do, but when just dropped into a world after a exposition that seems more like a short news documentary, knowing absolutely nothing about the game ruins the experience. Who am I, why am I here, is this place related to the information I was just shown? Will I be able to do anything but walk around this poorly contained area? Why can't I open this half-open gate, why is this door locked? Why is can't I see through any of these windows? The game fails to give players a purpose to play the game, and made me lose interest after ten minutes of walking in complete whiteness.  ",-1
I cried.,1
This is a fun little game if you got 72 hours to kill.,1
I want my money back! its was build upon lies and false prommises and the game honestly its so bad and broken its not worth playing at all. after a few hours completely and utterly destroyed such a good looking game ISNT EVEN MULTIPALYER?!?!?! WTF!,-1
"FPS is locked at 31 FPS, which you have to manually set to 60 in a config file. You can't completely turn off PhysX which is a pain in the buttocks for AMD users as it can cause framedrops. The double DRM is also stupidly implemented because no one will actually remember the credentials you've put in at the EA login. The gameplay is the only good thing thusfar. I give it a 6/10 I'd only recommend buying it on sale.",-1
Better than the first game in any aspect and very good to play with others especially your friends,1
"A bit let down with the demo to be honest, but still definitely worth a play. It requires quite a large space to play and they put some of the items you have to touch on the edges... meaning you can't go through the mission if your room is at the minimum. Still fun to play though and its free :D",1
"Even though this game is quite old, it's still a load of fun. I play this until the new game comes out. 9/10, only problem is lack of online but that's the developer's problem",1

"For the longest time I thought child birth was the most magical, amazing thing on earth. Then I played Rocket League.",1
Really enjoyed this game. The stunning and alien enviornments really bring me back to the good old days. I also appreciate the mechanical/logical style of the puzzles; I don't think there's a single puzzle in this game that isn't intimately connected to the world. Plus it has a fulfilling ending. For me the game was stable and bug-free. I didn't have one crash in my playthrough. Totally glad I got this!,1
"Slightly better than Bad Rats.  0,5/10.",-1
I come back to this game every once in a while. It will never get old,1
Very great game so many hours to use up in it and over 236 achivements the game reminds me of many elements from the original Final Fantasy such as creating everyone in your party and then farming gold for equipment and skills would play several playthroughs of this game many times cause i love the style of the game if you like old school classic JRPGS give this a try now,1

"I bought this game elsewhere, I bought it again on steam because I love it that much. This game is everything you'd want from a side scrolling RPG or 'Metroidvania' game. I was a huge fan of the Igarashi Castlevania games, and amid the pixel art games it's really refreshing to see a game with hand drawn sprites again. Lots of replay value, many ways to play with each of the four playable characters. It may seem difficult at first, but like the games of old you get better at it. It feels rewarding going back through and making light work of bosses because of your skill. The story is decent if you decide to look through it, but it's not necessary. The only gripe I had is the lack of a world map, until I learned what zone connect where. All in all, if you're into scrollers and like a challenge play this game.",1

An incredible game,1
"Adrenaline pumping run and gun mayhem blended seamlessly with objective based game play that requires teamwork and strategy as well as twitch shooting skill.  Pros: -Excellent mechanics -Synergies between classes/heros create powerful and rewarding interactions the make or break matches -Great level design -F2P model is good; LoL's is much less fair/grindy  Cons: -Although you can always find a match, even at 4am on a weekday, the playerbase is a bit low -No casual skill based matchmaking (yet, it's coming) means at some point you'll probably find yourself in a game going against someone with 1000+ hours who is having a higher impact on the match then everyone else on their team combined.  -Very occasional frame drops and a handful of fairly minor bugs -More maps would be great, currently there are 5 for the main mode and 3 for the more counterstrike/deathmatchy mode. -Cobalt skins -_- your team is always blue, enemy team is always red, rarest skins are Cobalt and covered in blue ♥♥♥♥. Even on enemies. You CAN tell the difference if you're paying attention, but in ~80h I've been killed by someone I'd assumed was friendly a couple times.",1
"More or less a more streamlined, shorted, on rails version of the base game. No real variety in enemies or weaponry here, but the gameplay is a least smoothed. Its more modern military shooter, less Far Cry 1. I ran the game via the 64bit exe so my game time on record here isn't accurate. Seemed to perform better at least. The story is more self contained thus not disappointing compared to the first but it just holds the story together and isn't at all interesting on its own.  Did you like the first or shooters in general? Then by all means, play this one, its more of the same and handles and looks just fine. Not really worth picking up otherwise but I bought it on $5 sale or so, so not too bad if you just want some AAA budget time filler game.",-1
You get to shoot things in a utterly confusing environment! Whats not cool about that?!   Also compatible with 3D vision! :D,1
"I've played this game extensively and only recently bought it on Steam, so my real hours are probably more like 30-40 hours.  This game is one of my favorite as far as allowing players to basically create their own mechanics goes. It honestly gives you some of the best tools to work with. AI that have semi predictable, but also somewhat realistic behaviours. There's a large array of tools at your disposal, from the firepower that you possess, to the main focus point of this game, that being the super suit that allows you to choose between speed, strength, invisibility and increased armor. And tying all this together, is a large open world enviroment that is designed specifically with directed, but branching pathways that allow players to approach any situation in any way they desire.  This alone is why you should buy the game.  True, it has beautiful graphics, and an amazing physics engine, the story is actually honestly interesting. Plus the gameplay manages to change as the enemies get tougher, the challenges change, and new approaches to situations arise as vehicles get worked into the campaign.  The single player is amazing, but lets get to one of the biggest drawbacks to this game as is.  Even when it was functional, the multi player was never quite there. The biggest drawback to this game was how high the system requirements were to play this game, only around 5-7 years after the game released was the average computer actually able to play it. So the multiplayer, while bloody amazing in my opinion, never got traction. At best there were ten people or so actually in a server.  But anymore, its impossible to play it because the gamespy servers shut down. Maybe there are ways to still play it, but the game you specifically buy doesn't have a way to play multiplayer.  There are also complications with running the 64bit version of the game, there are some things you need to patch in if it doesn't work on 64 bit, just to be aware. So this game does have its issues, but its still very much so a worthwhile buy.",1
THIS GAME IS REALLY GOOD PLEASE PLAY IF YOU HAVEN'T,1
Gunplay is not enjoyable ,-1
"Zuma's Revenge is an addictive game, it's pretty fun if you let yourself play for awhile, so I give a 9 out of 10 for this game. The game itself is cheap so what are you waiting for? Try it while you can :D",1
"Total War: Rome 2 suffered from a rough start, releasing with many questionable design choices and numerous severe bugs and optimization issues. This led to poor fan reception and a Metacritic score lower than that of any Total War title to date. At launch, and for quite some time after, I would not have recommended Rome 2. Thanks to Creative Assembly's continued support of the game, it has now reached a stage where it is extremely enjoyable with the recent release of the Emperor Edition. The game has metamorphosed drastically since the game received is initial reviews.  The Emperor Edition, released on September 16, 2014, drastically overhauled the game. The building system was redesigned for the better, factions all underwent extensive rebalancing and recieved new, more natural factional colors, unit abilities were overhauled, and last but not least, a new free campaign, Imperator Augustus, was released. All of this was added to the game free of charge! With the changes introduced in Emperor Edition, I definitely recommend Rome 2 to anyone interested in a grand strategy game with RTS and TBS elements set in the ancient world.  All of the DLC is recommendable, though depending on your personal preference, you may wish to skip the unit packs. The two DLC campaigns, Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the Gates, offer an experience different from that of the Grand Campaign and Imperator Augustus. They are more focused experiences, zooming in on the world map to flesh out Gaul and the Mediterranean, respectively, in greater detail than what is found in the Grand Campaign. Caesar in Gaul, Hannibal at the Gates, and Imperator Augustus all also operate at a slower yearly rate, with one turn per season, as opposed to the Grand Campaign's one turn per year. This greatly increases the number of turns you will have generals and agents at your disposal before they die of old age, allowing them to accrue more experience than they would be able to in the Grand Campaign. All of the DLC content is reasonably priced for its value, especially during sales.  My biggest gripe with the Rome 2 is how visually disappointing it is. The lack of true AA makes the game so much uglier, and the art direction really is vastly inferior to that of Shogun 2, in the UI, graphics, and soundtrack.  The UI itself is my second biggest problem with Rome 2. Coming straight from Shogun 2, I don't understand how they managed to make the UI so much worse. In Shogun 2, the UI beautifully blended with the style of the game, and functioned perfectly for gameplay purposes. In Rome 2, they somehow decided it was a good idea to make the UI take up more space on the screen, while at the same time making it more difficult to navigate and use. Between the advisor constantly popping on the screen for no reason, the unit stat card being permanently there and GIANT unless you want to manually hide it completely (instead of fading away like in Shogun 2), and the unit bar section taking up a way larger than necessary portion of your screen, right in the center, they really succeeded in consuming as much screen space as they could with their devolved UI. I just don't understand how they could have made the UI so much worse coming straight from Shogun 2, which had a magnificent UI.  My two gripes aside, I do recommend the game.",1
Very fun! The Multiplayer makes it very much worth the Purchase.,1
"Great war simulator. Way better than all these arcade shooters. In this game, you have to think strategically and be careful, because mechanics is demanding. It has developed multiplayer and many huge mods like Breaking Point, Exile etc. Campaign is more difficult than other games' campaignes, but multiplayer has many different kinds of servers. You will be satisfied. 9/10",1
"Some day in your life you will have to try this game. A classic from old Xbox restored epically to the PC. This game had more hours of gameplay that keeps you interested than any game i have ever played. Back when it was on old xbox i must have beat the game 50 times or more. I know every outcome to every single little option in the game and I didn't even have to look it up on a wiki, it is all from playing it myself. This is truly a game to be played and it truly has a seat among the legendary classics.",1
"This game is amazing so far. Way better than Borderlands 2 and as good, if not better than, Borderlands 1. If you watch the 10 minute introduction video with Torgue and Sir Hammerlock, they explain basically everything that I like that is new in this game. First, you're on the moon so there if very little gravity allowing you to fly across giant caverns of lava and make it safely to the other side. Using your O2 (oxygen) tank, you can redirect yourself in mid-air. Second, the gun algorithm has changed again allowing for a TON more guns than before. Who doesn't like more guns? Third, the maps are way better than the Borderlands 2 maps. If you havent played the original Borderlands, the maps in Borderlands 2 seem fine, but they aren't very good compared to the original maps. These maps in the Pre-Sequel are bigger, taller, and the design is better mainly because they need to be more navigable because of the low gravity. I'm not going to go into much deeper detail about the game, again watch the video that I mentioned earlier in the review because it explains in 10 minutes EXACTLY why you should get the game. Enjoy!",1
Very challenging and nice eerie atmosphere,1
Awesome game awesome story and bloody good graphics only problem is its a quick game to pass but its still worth every cent :),1
"I enjoyed this game, ALTHOUGH Steam spoiled the ending by giving me a Trading Card that said 'You know you did it.' &gt;.&gt;  Dark ambiance, pleasant music, dead babies, and mannequins? Sweet.",1
"NBA 2k15 is the next level of basketball experience through gaming. Seriously, a sick MyCareer storyline, probably relatable as to real NBA players. From social media statuses to real-life NBA player situations is just basically what both a gamer and a baller like me is craving to play for. Pre-game shows in NBA Today Quick games are awesome, i mean they even had Shaque to crack some jokes! AWESOME JOB 2KSPORTS! Would rate it 101/10!",1
This game is so much fun!,1

"Would definitely recommend this game.Amazing gameplay, solid performance, 60 fps even on low end PCs/Laptops. Only downside is online multiplayer has some issues. Takes a trip to China and back to play with my friends online. Otherwise solid game overall.  7.5/10",1

"A very solid game, however the Online could have been better.",1
"With all its technical problems, such as the FPS dropping to '5' every three seconds, and the developers do not give a s h i t about it, I can't recommend it... (1080p, strix 970, i5 4670k@4.5ghz, 24gb ram, no it's not on my end)  Bought it and tried it too late to the test the refund policy unfortunately... Gamewise however, it is a clunky trench-focused FPS without any sort of polishing. I would recommend spending your time with Red Orchestra 2/RS for a better iron sights experience.",-1
"Buy It! Play it! Love it!  It will Love you back !!  and then do it Again, so much fun ",1
"No game captures the feeling of large-scale combined arms combat as well as PlanetSide 2. You can participate in massive battles of 100s of players on either side, or you and a pal can hop in a jeep and attempt to sneak cap a base away from the battle. It's a pretty solid MMOFPS played solo, but with a group of friends it's hands-down one of the must fun and unique experiences you can have in gaming.",1
"This isn't really a game. It is more of an exploration/meditation experience, where you sit back, relax, and enjoy the music and setting. There is a great sense of immersion, and you can't help but admire the beautiful, pixel art backgrounds. I took screenshots of almost all the backgrounds they were so breath-taking. I did have a couple of problems with the game though. My biggest issue was that it was far too short. This game would have been in my top 10 favourite games if it weren't for its brevity. I also found it disappointing the fact that you can't come back to explore more without starting a new game. That would be greatly appreciated in an update.  Personally, I think this game should be ported to the app store as an ios game, so you can quickly pull out your phone and quickly immerse yourself in this fantastic world.    I absolutely loved it.  ",1
This game is too good. I CANT HANDLE THIS ♥♥♥♥.  9.9/10,1
"It's alright as a timepassing game if you like mahjong. But if you want something you want to play for hours, this isnt the game for you. It's free to play, but pay to continue .. when you're out of energi. I like to play it while wating for other players on other games.",1
"Having finally got round to this long after its release, i can say its an authentic Jagged Alliance experience. A lot of the mercs you'll be familiar with are there and the gameplay is very similar to the original games. Theres a good range of weapons (see mods note below) and all the ammo types you'd expect to find. The overworld map works the same as the original games and militia can be trained to hold on to the places you liberate, allowing you to hire more mercs as the money starts rolling in. The map isnt as large as the earlier games, and theres a few bits of questionable voice acting/script and they should have had a naming convention to stop some of the names of NPCs from Kickstarter backers only been funny if your 12 and still into purile humour - but they also seem to be at random and none game changing - so can be ignored. My biggest niggle is some of the quest text isnt very helpful, so you end up doing a fair amount of headscratching saometimes for the ones that dont have a set location (most do - and they show an icon on the sector map, so those aren't an issue). I installed 4 mods just to help, The 3 info mods by Shanga - 2 for map icons and one that gives all the weapons proper names and reveals the bonuses from add-ons like scopes etc and handily lists on Ammo what weapons its used for. The final mod was a small one to add toolkits / medkits to the basic shop, as i found very early on that the early enemies dont seem to drop them and i couldnt find any toolkits anywhere so had weapons starting to collapse. The problems this game had during development are well documented and i wont bother going into them, but i dont think they affect the gameplay. ",1
"This is really a unique game that I'm enjoying greatly so far.  From the pictures of the game it may seem like any 4x game, but in reality the pace and feels to me more similar to an old school RPG, with a card mini game instead of turn based combat.  TLDR: If you like games that have RNG, RPG elements, and management, this is for you. Pick it up, as I haven’t played a game this unique in a while.   Pros: -Everything meshes well, from inventory management to exploration to resource gathering, you really get engrossed with the mechanics while trying to win. -Great artwork and art style. -The card game is challenging and has enough depth to keep it fun, without being too time consuming and complicated to the extent that you'll get fatigue from the number of encounters you'll have in the game.  Cons: (I’m more writing this hoping the devs will gets some ideas how to make improvements) -The writing is subpar, oftentimes throwing walls of text at you or being sort of silly. I haven't gotten much into the main quest, but I can't say I'm very interested in the story, just more into the gameplay itself as you try to complete it. Sometimes individual encounters will have interesting folklore or mythology to it (the game is inspired by Slavic mythology apparently) but in general I would have preferred a more concise text based storyline and a better story in general. -The “skull” system for giving you an idea how difficult an encounter could be needs some work in my opinion. I’d much rather have a statistic screen showing me the likelihood of outcomes (i.e. % chance you’ll win, % chance you’ll win but a party member will be gravely wounded, % chance you’ll lose etc.) In addition, the skulls don’t really give you a good prediction of the difficulty of enemies you’ll be fighting. I might not have played enough to see the patterns better, but a 3 skull fight sometimes surprises me as a cake walk while another 3 skull fight throws creatures at me that will guarantee to kill my entire party.  -The U.I. is in general good, but the most “busy work” time seems to be when you’re adding and comparing equipment for your individual villagers. It needs streamlining, for instance: when I have a villager selected and look over a weapon in the general inventory I should get a box that appears that compares that item with what he has currently equipped instead of having to individually hover over each item to determine stats. Another aspect is that all the stats numbers for characters seem to be jumbled on the screen instead of alphabetized, so the attack power of one character will be on a random spot on his stat screen that’s different from another character’s position. In addition the production screen will state you have enough material to build a certain item when you in fact don’t, as 3 different items of the same type can’t be combined to produce something. Though these seem kind of nitpicky, for a game like this small U.I. difficulties really add up the “busy work” time wasted. I hope to see some of this updated in the future.  -For a game that forces you to only have 1 village, the village maintenance mechanic is fairly Vanilla. I would like a way for you village to expand its gathering zone (while having some way to keep it balanced) as well as having different options for buildings. Right now, you have only a few options for buildings (with a 10 building cap), and you destroy and rebuild the same buildings just with different parts to try and get a bit better buffs.  ",1
"I game that's as catchy as it is cool. Become the thug/henchmen, and carry out some of the darkest deeds, all in the name of some blonde babes, and a random dude with a chicken head. Weird... Really weird, and it get's ever more strange with each subsequent mission.",1
A very good classical turn-based tactical rpg game with a good physics.  10/10,1
"There Came an Echo is a well done voice controlled strategy game with an interesting story, appealing visual style and truly Great soundtrack (Must buy IMO) by Big Giant Circles and Ronald Jenkees.  Now while the voice commands worked relatively well for myself I can imagine like with most voice systems accents may be an issue. The game can however be controlled wihout voice but the radial command setup while getting the job done can cause incorrect commands to be entered at times which can frustrate at crucial moments.  The game is entirely story driven and overall I would say that its a good one, strong characters backed up with good voice acting keeps you interested in its story which has some interesting revelations along the way lets say. Additionally due to the small focused character pool and as mentioned voice acting you do come to understand each character fairly well in the short time you have but as always this could have been expanded upon.  With regards to the games length game after a few mission retries it holds up to around 3-4 hours gameplay and while this may disappoint, I sometimes find that a relatively short but focused story can be really good at least most will get to experience the full game even with little game time to spare.  Overall while due its length you may find it not be worth its full price of admission, being able to support a small indie studio like Iridium Studios with this games willingness to experiment with voice controls which granted has been done before it does bode well for future development of this gameplay method.  I recommend this game to those looking for a story driven voice controlled strategy game with an interesting setting that at times when using the voice system really does make you think and I look forward to what Iridium Studios develops next.  P.S  -Voice command system does allow for voice commands to be edited to your preferences character names etc. -Use Right click to provide commands without voice for some reason It took me a while to figure this out and I can't remember this being pointed out.",1
"Fun, and fairly short to really beat thoroughly(4 hrs for all optional objective playthrough, 9 for that + new game plus playthrough). I have to give it negative marks for the last level, which completely changes how the game works. Goes from checkpoints allowing you to slowly but surely progress through the level, into having to do the entire level in one go. I only encountered one, but there are also some physics bugs where I jumped into a fake 'room' that couldn't be escaped. I'll change my review to positive if the developer ever fixes the last level.",-1
"From what I've played so far, (Which is not nearly enough compared to others) I find this game very amusing and fun. It gives me a rush and reminds me of other fast paced games. It's fast, but slow when needed. I cannot wait to see what the rest of the game has to offer! I just need to stop dying by my own hands.",1
Surpisingly one of the best horror games I've ever played,1
"its fun, and fairly simple. just infect the world. its the fact that the way you do it is interesting, is why this is so fun. evolving your bacteria, having to choose the right starting locations, fighting a cure, ect. theres even multiplayer, so thats a bonus.",1
preddy good. usually pretty horrible balance in favour of axis tho,1
The devs have f**ked up bad. Read other reviews for a little more backstory.,-1
they game doesnt work,-1
"A lot of hate but the game isnt bad at all. the combat is good, i like the fact i can dodge attacks, and crafting making houses and catching mounts is pretty dope. I enjoy it more than AK.",1
Game is good for single player. Multiplayer servers are not working properly,1
This game rattled my bones.  Go play it.  Also now I have some new OTPs.,1
- Fix many generator to 99% - Someone chased by killer - i save that person  - killer try to chased me  - i chased and the killer hang me to the hook - all player just fixed to all generator i fixed  - they run to exit gate and leave me alone in the hook - i died  - i lost my rank - The end   - true story -  'Don't trust anyone or someone if you want to survive' - by me - 2016    update - so many Killer Camper  - killer trash talk after match - survivor corporate with killer  - no report feature  RIPENGLISH,1

"I havent had a ton of time to dig into this game fully. However, from the little Ive played, if you like city builders, you need to pick this up. It's by far leaps and bounds above what large developers offer in the same category.",1
is incredible,1
"Sometimes I think there's a black hole where my heart should be, but this game made my heart start beating again. I laughed, I cried, I cried some more.. there's more story being told in this 4 hour game than a meeting of the International Community of Bards. Invest in some glass eyes because mine stopped working from dehydration. I wish I could develop amnesia and play this game for the first time again. Well worth any amount of money.  Buy it. Now.",1
"Good variety of music genres, funny/entertaining cut scenes, and fun gameplay. You'll be holding your keyboard like a Keytar.",1

"Great game, great concept, great humor. Catched it on sale (with the second that now i will play) and were all money well spent. Probably cause of the longevity it don't worth 7 euros, but on sale is a must  10/10",1

"Really solid game. Despite a few shortcomings, which have plenty of publicity already in other reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.   The story certainly has its weak moments, but it kept me engaged to the end. I think the really strong point of this game is the combat and stats system. The way it is set up allows for a lot of customization within a class, such that you could play the same class in completely different ways in different play-throughs. The party make-up aspect multiplies that customization by 6. The different classes available are very fun to play around with when making a build.",1
"One of the best game, I have ever played.",1
"If i wanted to turn in circles in a dark room, void of all possibility of even having fun, this would be the game!!! Played about 5 mins, then realised my IQ had gone down several points. The only redeeming feature of this game is the 'hippie lens'. Great soundtrack, i think, my sound was off. If you are still playing this after 5 hours, god bless your soul...",-1
played for 10 hours it says connection to server lost. game stops immediately and all my progress lost every time bugfix even more bugs appear. but the idea is awasome so i keep trying with (wiht rage sometimes),-1
Play this game and be a god.,1
"One of the best strategy game I've played, totally worth your money.",1
Decent diversion for a few minutes. I unlocked everything in the game and beat every level in less than an hour. Gets repetative after a few levels. This is basically a flash game that someone decided to charge money for. If you can get it for a dollar or something go for it but I wouldn't pay much more.,1
"Very good and spooky game, kind of like amnesia in the sense that you cant fight the monster but whole new concept of the game and atmosphere. Would reccomend to any fan of SciFi and Horror. 10/10",1
  I remember the good ol' days when this game was controller supported and i had good internet and it was fun. Now it's on PC and my hand isn't big enough for the keyboard. If your not puting back on consol at least make it controller supported,1
Space trukin' for all.,1
"A dark but not excessively dramatic game with a slight Planescape: Torment vibe to its atmosphere and side characters. The music is beautiful and well-chosen for the scenes that are meant to get to you (and they really do), and the voices feel spot on for most characters you meet. Some puzzles can get frustrating due to the combination of 'I don't need this right now' for interactable objects that you might or might not use in the future and objects that only become interactable when something else happens in a different area. However, dialogue usually contains hints on where you need to go, and your humorous floating  skull  sidekick might have something useful to say as well, so pay attention. There's a variety of endings, and you're not restricted to the path of the good guy, though, by that time you'll be questioning your definition of a 'good guy' and how good your actions actually were. This game will definitely make you think and not just about solving puzzles.   tl;dr Buy it. It's great.",1
"Amazing! It's like taking a time capsule into the past, only you can only chat with emily on IM. You do many things so SPOILERS! you can talk about how friends are great or jerkfaces, you can try to date emily (which gets ruined right in the next chapter) and many other things. I also love the logos, everything from eminem to saw is there from 2002 to 2005",1
  It's one of the best fps i've ever played.It's the game who every pc gamer should have.It's ALSOWME!!!!!,1
Not to miss. An epic adventure full of wise-cracks and screams of 'HELP ME GOD-DAMNIT IT'S GOT MY DAMN LEG'. Buy Today!,1
"I finished this game about a week ago now, and it still consumes my thoughts. I didn't expect to become as attached as I did to these characters, but the incredible writing and beautiful setting sucked me right in and wouldn't let go. I find myself missing these fictional characters after putting the game down, and it's been a long time since a game made me feel that way.  If you enjoy emotional stories, slice of life dramas, or small town charm, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game. You won't be disappointed.",1
"good things first: the game is fun to play. Old school as hell and collecting all secrets in a level could be fun ... if :   the bad things wouldn ruin all this. The game is a 'crash fest' like i never played one before. And as there are many (and i mean MAAAAAAAAAAANY) complaints about this issue , ID did not patch this ♥♥♥♥ until now. And i realy doubt that they will ever do  so there is a good game thats not playable for me and many others. and thats why i dont recommend it to others",-1
"Yes I enjoyed this game a lot, and if you liked any of the assassin's creed games be sure to have this one!",1
"This game is great. The graphics are great. Me and my friends call it, 'Grinding to get better at grinding.' which is okay, i love the hack and slash feel and the abilities. It has one MAJOR flaw. The updater for this thing (The Evolution Engine) is absolutely horrid. I run a 50 mb/ps connection and my computer is a gaming computer made by myself. When i have to update, no matter the size of the update or what i do (ive tried it all), I download at 60 bytes/ps. This recent update i havent been able to even update at all because of the launcher itself crashing. So its a great game and yeah go put some money into it, but the company does not listen to their community about support or bugs, they only want to release the next warframe or prime. This updater has given me so much trouble that i refuse to play the game again util they fix the issue. It does not happen to everyone but thet 1 or 2% that it does happen to, congrat! Join the club.   All in all, its a great game. But they need to completely redo the launcher, its trash.",-1
"so much hate with survivors. I guess thats realism.  + : great concept, audio, interesting gameplay  - : i had great expectations, really looked forward to it, i guess that was wrong. And I really wanted to finish it or at least make progress but everyone died even before i got into the story/game. :(  will try the sequel. 5/10 you decide, will recommend just if you have no other choice lol, would hate again",1
"Amazing game, its like playing a retro cartoon mixed with hotline miami. You play two characters, Rox the Girl and Slayter the boy, both has a similar fight level. Rox is more stelth and Slay more rambo styl.  With Rox you can walk and shoot and drive your moto, with Slay you drive your moto and shoot driving. You use the same masks as on hotline miami, at least the horse and tiger mask are the same.   Pro: Nice tracks Good retro look Good story Nice gameplay (shoot, drive, eliminate enemies) Nice music full of action  Con: sometimes bugs and glitches but ealy rare  End: if you love Trials Games you may try this but beware, if you only love to drive and have crazy tracks this may not be for you because you have to walk and shoot, its not a 'normal' trials game you know. But for me its one of the best trial games and much better then Far Cry Blood Dragon. graphic is realy good and looks sooo retro, remembers me a lot of hotline miami.  If the price is too expensive for you just waite for a sale, 50% off is a steal price in my eyes.",1

Whether you are one with the shadows and only use lethality to complete an objective or a ruthless killer that has no intention of remorse after killing a man in cold blood, this game will bring out the true meaning of 'hero'.

"I played the Alpha, runned smoothly, loved the game, pre-purchased it. Then, I heard about the upcoming DLCs and how they were going to be additional monsters and hunters. That alone turned me off (and I'm going to explain why), so I asked for a refund. I played the Beta and suddenly the game was unplayable, stuck at 10FPS constantly when during the Alpha I played comfortably at 60FPS. What went wrong?  Regarding DLCs: -A DLC has to be an addendum to a finished product. It ads a dessert to someone who finished the meal and would like some more. - In any case it is not mashed potatoes, rice or veggies to try out instead of pasta. When the menu is set, it doesn't get changed!  What Evolve's DLC offer: -They're not mappacks as not to split community. That is commendable, but I wouldn't mind AT ALL paying for that kind of DLC, as it adds a new playground to a fixed gameplay. -The DLC offer different monsters/hunters, i.e. it offers different gameplay mechanics. How come is this not chipping away at the core game?  Turtle Rock's answer: The DLC content is going to be completely new and has not been thought of in the base game, we're not removing any content from the base game (or something in those lines).  Me: So you're saying that, for an assymetrical multiplayer game, you're going to be releasing a stream of gameplay changing content that will inevitably mess the fragile equilibrium of the game and not even give access to that content to the entire comunity?  Also, as advantages are bound to happen, I'm sure you will not nerf down DLC characters too much, I mean: it's realistic for you to want DLC's to have a selling argument. Right? If so, isn't your game turning out to be a pay-2-win, although I have to pay for the base game?  TR:  But you get to play against and with the people who have that content, you're not going to be separated from the comunity, even if you don't purchase the DLCs.  Me: So you're telling me that the code for all the DLC content is going to be downloaded to my PC as well, as I need to see it in action on other players, and that I will have to pay for it to unlock? Well thanks for adding every so months a few gigabites of DLC download that I won't be even able to use unless I give you some money...   In the end this is my point of view:  I would have gladly payed the pre purchasing price and even a season pass/game combo if the DLC's wouldn't have been gameplay related, but this setup is a recipe for disaster and I don't want to be caught up in the mess that is going to be balancing the game at each new character addition. Plus in a year or even less there is going to be a deluxe package for 30 euros where I can get all the content at once with most of the bugs fixed as well. (EDIT: I told it so, now it's becoming free to play! Best course of action was to wait and not buy...)  So in the end, don't buy this game as long as the gameplay balancing hasn't been achieved, and this will last as long as they're adding characters...",-1
this is one of the most fun games i have played in a long long long long long long time.,1
"I love the Dragon Age game franchise. The only think that I have a proplem with here is that there is no controller support. Regardless, this game is a game that you can beat...100+ times, and still you come back for more. And you see something new everytime you play. I HIGHLY recommend this game to all fans of table top and virtual RPGs. It is even a nice game to play if you only have slight experience with RPGs and you understand the concept.",1
good tactical game,1
"A bandit scared off, when he noticed i have a rocket launcher in my hand xD                     -poor/boring music, weapon and other sounds are good however -skybox is not moving,but its very beautiful 2D sky -no footbandits in wasteland -the thing that you have to take quests from npc from town allways and driving from A to B, makes the gameplay broken a bit, 'talking' with npc doesnt make any sense in this game.Breaks the well made shooting momentums, especially if you hate driving in fps.(i suggest ignore all race which is needed for main quest,however we have car towing) it would be better just with straight forward shooter,or design the game more deeper RPG style with car racing making sense atleast. -I could accept the hp regen in this game,but the revive is not welcomed, medkits totally useless -too much Half life 2 elements -its not open world game(interactions etc..),only visually the enviroment is open world which is fine in FPS. -I like Idtech5, characters well detailed and animated and like 50% of area is looking good as well, but sadly the rest looks bad and the 'contrast' makes it just worse. -melee enemies are very good in this game, best i ever seen in fps after return to castle wolfenstein lol -the final level is not rly good gameplay wise looks like just a movie easy time run and gun with the op gun -OK story overall, but story telling is not the best  RAGE doesnt have performance or texture pop-in issues, if you follow this guide  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385532207 ",1

"A titan among RPGs.   The Good. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt brings a vivid and atmospheric world,  full of bounties to collect, treasures to find and monsters to hunt... did I mention atmosphere? The story and dialogue alone makes this game an instant classic, it blends drama and bloodshed with jokes and wonder. The world size could be.. more, for those that enjoy massive scale. The world is large allready but much of it is either open water or dreadfully boring swamps. Also the fact that the city of Vizima is actually only the interior of a palace gives another 'meh' to the count. The combat is enjoyable and your character has skills and full gear to be customized. *Micro spoiler: Ciri is almost more fun to play as than Geralt.* Free DLC, also a nice addition.  The Bad. Your horse is possibly the dumbest individual in the game. Character movement can be clunky and get you stuck behind boxes, more annoying than game-breaking tho. Combat against multiple enemies can be hard at times, but it's even worse when friendly AI does nothing but soak up punches, block YOU from attacking and get you killed by being dumb. On some occations the game will randomly pause for a moment while trying to load a sequence in a dialogue that takes place further away. Rarely but still happening none the less, the game will get stuck in a loadingscreen into infinity, typically after dying and reloading. (This issue seems to have been fixed.   After playing Hearts of Stone I have to say the DLC is absolutely worth it. Cannot wait for Blood and Wine.",1
"Almost everything I want out of a turn-based WWII game.  Review update:  I bought this game prior to the change from Pacific Theater to WWII overall/the F2P/DLC shift. I am very happy with these changes. In not gyping me of what I had paid for so far, the devs showed respect to the existing player base, and the move offered both the chance to expand the player base as well as taking a hex/TB strategy game format that was excellent and expanding the scope of the game. I immediately purchased the DLC that wasn't comped to former payers, and I'm eagerly waiting on the future releases. As a hex/TBSformat fan, the presentation/depth/execution of this game is the best digital offer I have seen since Robert E Lee: Civil War General 2(not available on Steam, but out there for the war gamer for free at various outlets), although excecution similarities abound.   If you are looking for a TBS wargame (WWII especially) with less depth than Hearts of Iron, but with more of everything else than anything else, this is the game to invest your time and money into.",1

Well i guess i'm undertale trash... this game is very fun because in it killing isnt your goal like in other rpgs you are supposed to befriend the monsters you meet and every death... changes everything about the story... it's a really fun game and i recommend it to everyone!,1

"Even with a modest retro aesthetic, Downwell is an instant classic from its highly exciting and innovative gameplay. Its pacing feels perfect to play right away, and its roguelike elements guarantee a fresh run every time. I also appreciated how it incentivises you to use different playstyles and keep your combo meter up.  An air of mystery surrounds elements of the game in terms of visual storytelling, and the music and sounds are also very catchy. If you're a fan of action, this is not one to miss - especially at such a low price.",1
"So far, amazing game. Fluid gameplay, stunning graphics, and with the exception of a long initial loading time (which people seem to have confused with a startup glitch) no major bugs of any note. Fantasy gameplay, Total War gameplay, not the buggy release of Rome 2. Fantastic.",1
"I failed GaoKao because of this game, and also failed GaoKao in this game.  I need help with my life. This isn't part of the act anymore.   Play this game if you support those Chinese Schoolgirls and their animoose.  ",1
"Worth every cent. This game is sick as fun, the whole theme of it is just what I expected from the trailer, the soundtrack is just amazing, ready to make you start trippin'.",1
"Despite all the negativity this game has been getting recently I still do believe it is absolutely superb. The a.i. aren't ridiculously stupid and will offer a good challenging fight that tests your abilities to make and control fleets, technological advancements are at a good, balanced pace, and each faction offers a unique way of playing; or you could make your own! About the only negative I can really think of and it isn't much of one is how you have to research being able to offer peace, make allianced, and trade. But overall this is a very good 4x game that I would give a 9/10 and do highly recommend it to anyone even remotely thinking of buying it.",1
"If this game was a few Mexican people, they would make the best Mariachi band ever known to man.  10/10 would burn all villages again.",1
"It's pretty bad. Well, it's ALRIGHT.   But it's fun in the least :D   Only wait for it to be a few cents though, NOT FULL PRICE.",1
"This is a such a fun game, it really flexes your planning muscles, even on the easier levels. Another nice suprise is the extra levels that are thrown in outside of the regular campaign. I got this game on sale, but after playing it I probably would have paid full price for it. Definitely a game strategists need to have in their library.",1
Worth $5-$10. A good nostalgic game. Can hook up controllers for co-op using 1 PC or co-op online. I have not tried but it appears that you and a friend can use 1 PC to co-op online also. It appears that there are about 15-20 story levels. Colleseum mode is pretty fun: survive six waves and get a new cape every season.,1
"Going back to games I played back in Amiga-days like Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky, and Loom, as well as text adventures like Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy, this holds up really well in comparison, and manages to be quite original into the bargain.  The stories are easy to relate to, as they're set in the real world, and you can easily forgive the sometimes odd quirks or occasionally below-par acting because they're obviously very low-budget and made by a group of likeable, quirky, old-school-imaginative people. Playing the Blackwell games is quite a lot like reading a good book or watching a skilfully-plotted TV or film series.  My favourite game in the series so far, and it seems to be substantially longer, too.",1

"  Do not purchase if you are deaf, tone deaf, or otherwise hard-of-hearing - there's a puzzle that relies on hearing and is randomly generated (so can't be bypassed with a walkthrough).

It's Alright.,1
Extremely underrated by Metacritics. The game is worth a buy for the voiceacting and the humorous approach alone. GRAB IT NOW!,1

Best free to play game on the internet. And of course I can confirm that this is not pay to win in any way. It has a great community and a lot of events to take part it. Highly recommend it :D,1

"the game it self is pretty fun. fun idea, ORIGINAL consept!!!! funny. nice gameplay. it would be a good game if not from the point that you start a match you are imidetly askt to pay to gave all the classes. its like when you would want to start tf2 and you can only play soldier and heavy and for the rest you would have to pay. this makes very unbalanced games (if not for the class payment this wouldn't be so) becaus there are tons of people that want to play a free to play game first to check it out and then pay. SO you gave a team with the only two classes avalible. and if the other team has oh i don't know ANY other class your team is basicly f#ckt. this would be a great game if not for the class payment that makes it a total pay 2 win.  if they gonna change it i would gladly play it but if not.... you can buy the medic and rek any 'free to play team'   3/10 -could be good but they f#ckt it up",-1

Best Shooter in a long time.,1
"First off I want to say that I am not a Sonic fan nor really of racing games, yet I loved this game.  This game reminds me of Mario Kart, it has alot of elements which need to be mentioned:  The level design is great and very creative which also keeps the game from getting dull.  Bots have great difficulty adjustments, you will have to work up your skill and learn the game before you can win against the harder AI.  The graphics is clear and beautiful with a high definition cartoony smoothed out look, which runs smooth, and should run even on low end machines.  The vehicle handling in this game is incredible feels like a real arcade game  Fairly balanced customizable characters to choose from heaps from which you will recognise, each having their own vehicle look and transformation which is a nice touch.  COOP CAMPAIGN (This is something I haven't seen done much, and it is one of the features which I had the most fun and makes this game stand out from other games in general).  The campaign itself is very creative with having modes I have never seen doen before like 'Traffic Attack' (reaching checkpoints dodging traffic) 'Drift mode' (drift on marks on the ground that give you extra time to reach the end) 'Versus' (Go head to head against waves of bots and take them out or get ahead of them before they take you out) 'Boost challenge' (drive over the boost marks on the ground to reach the end before time runs out). So many more.. But what makes this better is that you can do all this with your friends together and unlock new maps and characters which keeps you locked in the game trying to beat bosses and progress through the campaign.  The transformation with the kart, to boat, to air vehicle works great and just makes the game more original.  A game you should definately play split screen with friends and one you can challenge yourself to reach your All Star potential. 9/10",1
"Amazing game, not just a Minecraft rip-off. However recently Glyph has stopped working, and I can't launch the game.",1
Good game if you like history and if you want to learn something when playing.,1
"I like the game too much to give it a thumbs down but it's crazy un-realistic. They got the trucking part down pretty good but they need to work on really getting the true feel of Europe. There are no Muslim refugees running around on the highway throwing rocks at my truck and crawling between my cab and trailer hitching rides.  Also the market breaks every now and then which is a little annoying. But it's very calming, too calming, I have fallen asleep while driving before NOT in game. I'm sure if we had something to actively do like dodge muslims trying to slow your truck down for free rides (or just hit them for like bonus cash) would really help the gameplay. And really get a better feel of 2016 Europe, plus a few atmospheric changes like changing a few of those empty fields into refugee camps would really emerse me in what it means to be European.",1
what?? i got this game for free,1
its allright lol,1
"I bought it for no reason, Just treason",1
"Final Fantasy X is absolutely brilliant. It has my favourite combat system in the whole series: purely turn based (no active-time), with the ability to swap party members in and out mid-battle. This makes it feel strategic, and ensures you can keep your less-liked charactes caught up with the others without too much hassle. Summons are quite fun to use and important to the story, rather than just being spells with long cutscenes.   The music is fantastic, and the remaster comes with a completely redone soundtrack (though you're free to switch back to the original soundtrack at will). Other enhancements include upgraded graphics (of course) and a few cheats that you can either ignore, use to speed things up while grinding, or completely break in the game in half.   It's a great port, at a great price.  Oh, and you even get Final Fantasy X-2 as well. Which is... not as bad as some people say.",1
ballsacks sure,1
why are you even reading the reviews buy the game,1
its awesome,1
♥♥♥♥ this game and everyone who plays it   jk,1
"Massive amounts of power creep from DLC, massive AMOUNT of DLC, and now the icing atop the cake, as of this writing (10/20/2015) it has microtransactions. With stat boosts. YEAH.  Fun enough game for 300 hours (great game with friends), but at this point i'm just gonna warn everyone away because you have to drop so much money to play with good weapons and all that.  Not gonna give this the time of day for a proper review, so 4/10, your practices are bad, Overkill, and you should feel bad.",-1
"This game. This game right here. This game is amazing on so many levels. The gameplay is fun and fast paced, the setting is scaringly accurate on some levels and the characters are wonderful. I recommend buying this - if that hadn't gone through already ^^  It might require a second playthrough or viewing of the final arc before you get the big picture, but it is so worth it. And no. It is not trying to be scary like the old bioshocks - but if you like the wicked cruelty of a society trapped in the pit of rasicm and fanatism - and the destruction of it: you're going to enjoy this game.",1
"Hate to do this...but for now, don't buy this game. I'm honestly regretting it right now. You can read it in a plethora of reviews here, but I'll say my piece, and like many others, will update once things have settled down.  Servers: Wow. This is...just wow. I got in loads of play time, and I mean LOADS while in the beta for this game. Everything worked wonderfully, not a lot of lag regardless of platform or location. Now, on 'release' I can't even log in. When I do finally log in (and stay logged in long enough to try anything) nothing works. I spent a solid ten minutes sitting waiting for it to find a ranked match. So I tried to make a private room to invite a friend...nope. Always fails. There, essentially, is no online functionality right now. None at all.  Side note, no online prevents you from getting rewards in...  Story Mode: Wow. Just. Wow. This is truly a terrible thing to behold. I'm pretty sure I've seen six-year-olds draw more detailed pictures of SF characters. I mean, seriously Capcom, what the actual heck? This is the laziest excuse for a story mode I've ever seen. Titan Fall has a more fleshed out story mode in it. Why not just give us an arcade mode instead? I know, I read that story mode wouldn't come with the games 'release' but still...dang.  Control: Well, I mean, if you want to mess with Joy2Key, yeah. If you like playing on an XBone controller, sure. Controls great. For real though, why would you 'release' a game that you can't even re-bind things. That's some BASIC funtionality right there. Ouch, Capcom...ouch.  Sound is great, I like the in-battle visuals. But, that won't make up for everything else.  Overall: You might note I always say 'release', and that's because you are paying full price for a broken beta of a game right now. Capcom put out Street Fighter V: Early Access, and I am not okay with it. If they had even had working servers, this review would be COMPLETELY different. I could put up with a LOT of garbage if it meant beating the snot out of my friends all night. But...NOTHING works.  Training mode. Training mode works great. If you want to spend $60 for training mode, buy this game NOW!",-1
"If you want some run and gun with a survival horror twist and strategizing with other people, then this game is for you!!!",1
This game is great. Fully customizable weapons like sniper-shotguns or minigun-snipers that shoot fire. And its free,1
"The PC version is a buggy mess at the moment, and after missing the November 1st patch deadline by two days the community manager suddenly claims 'the PC version has had the 1.02 patch since release' despite none of the fixes or balance changes being present. When called out on this, he locked the thread. Between this and the store page bait&amp;switch, avoid this game until Namco decides it wants to start giving a ♥♥♥♥ about the PC version. Especially at full price.  Edit: as of Nov. 24 (one full month after release), the PC version finally recieved its first patch (1.03), which contrary to its notes fixes literally nothing, in fact introduces even more bugs (step vanishing now somehow triggers a burst dash instead around 50% of the time when playing online). I'm starting to wonder if this PC port is just a very elaborate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on Namco's part, and I would seriously go for a refund at this point if it wasn't already far too late.",-1
"Game making made easy!   RPG Maker VX Ace was a fantastic piece of software. This has then blown the ship out of the water.

I wrote a negative review of this game probably a year or two ago. It's in a very different state now that it was then. After nearly 160ish hours into the game I've enjoyed it enough to pay into the microtransactions.   My only gripe with the game is that there seems to be very little as far as intuitive tutorials for new players. My first 20 hours getting back into it were spent in the wiki trying to look up how to use a lot of the systems properly.  After you're over that hump it's a very good game,1
I probably shouldn't have downloaded this game,1
"Excellent game... but it is far too short. Buy it if it's on sale, otherwise go for Dragonfall.  RPG focussing on gameplay and content over style and visuals, bringing all the complexities of the Role Play rules into a PC version without feeling like it's bogging you down with endless rules.",1
This Game is great.,1
Best horrorgame I've ever played. Was an horrificlly grotesque hour of gameplay!  Was so grotesque in fact that I even started a second playtrough.  I rate 9 out of 11,1
A game that play's well with an interesting consept.,1
"Really aggressive and enjoyable gameplay with decent online capabilities. The story can be cheesy and strange but fun overall. Combined with a unique art style (with obvious sex appeal), constant game support and updates, and a good growing community; this is a great game to have and play.",1
"Very fun, you should buy this game.",1
Terminal map /server/ is missing after new update.,-1
"Neutral.  The game is good but campaign is too short. It took about 18 hours and I was quite slow. Modern 'Buy DLC' distribution model.  The game is not challenging. Dungeon Keeper 2 beats this game in almost every aspect. Well, except the narrator. This part was quite good.",-1
"Very fun, just like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of GTA and Spider Man",1
"I've played this before, it's really fun! I like it, the massive multiplayer, the huge selection of weapons. They need to fix some of the lag. Overall I give it a thumbs up ",1
" Assassin's Creed III  otherwise known as 'WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?' takes Desmond to a new frontier with Ratonhnhaké:ton, a Native American Assassin who goes by the name of Connor.   Assassin's Creed III  has always been my favourite of the whole AC series. Ubisoft took many risks with the game, especially with Connor, who is definitely neither an Altair or Ezio in terms of personality. Many see him as dull and lacking any character, but I saw a man who uses the creed to seek justice and revenge. I found the story nice with an interesting moral behind it.   It may be my favourite game but I can see why it gets a lot of hate. The intro/tutorial sequence lasting multiple hours where you play as Haytham Kenway drags on, but is necessary to set the story in motion. Story has never been Ubisoft's strong point, however, instead capitalising on the other aspects. Combat is brutal, but stealth is sadly absent, with the missions feeling very linear. Connor prefers the direct approach aside to taking assassinations slowly, which didn't bother me as much. None of the characters appear more than two-dimensional.  Environments are beautiful and detailed, with new weather patterns and summer/winter seasons. Snow adds a new dimension to the world, making you want to travel by horse or tree. The frontier in iteslf is massive and ready to be explored, but there is barely anything to do. Ubisoft missed many opportunities to really make  Assassin's Creed III  stand out here. The Hunting mechanic is very basic at hunt, sell, hunt, sell. Crafting feels largely inaccessible, with side mission progression keeping the higher level items locked up.   I could find everything that's wrong with  Assassin's Creed III , but I would still recommend it. It sets out and dares to be different than the previous games. The first-look E3 gameplay trailer made the game look a lot cooler than it is.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZrklEy9ohQ ",1
Game is not too long but I enjoyed the story and gameplay.,1
broke my heart. 20/10,1
9.5/10 A great game. It is very exciting and sometimes challening with all the decisions you have to make.,1
its awsome  ,1
"Good game, but disapointing ending. Too much randomness and just weird things happening at the end. I would recommend getting this if its on sale. And don't feel too bad if you don't finish the main story line. That is not what is good in this game.",1
"I executted a perfect roll under my enemy's rapier, thrust through his intenstines and ran off a cliff to be eaten by a giant worm within one smooth motion. In the next moment, the two of us threw our swords at eachother, clashing midair, leading to intense fisticuffs until my enemy knocked me to the ground and snapped my throat. Thats how this game goes down. Buy it.",1
"This game is a very addictive and interesting post apocolyptic scenario. The one thing to remember when playing this game is that when your iriginal members die, Game Over. It would be cool to see that removed but then the game might last too long. The actual point is to see how long you can survive. Very compelling details in the journal as you make decisions to kill. My advise is to always have search parties out scavenging. This game is more than worth the money!!",1
A really fun little old style game. that is all. get it. try it. have fun i r8 it 4 stars :militaryStar: :militaryStar: :militaryStar: :militaryStar:,1
"This Game is one of the most addicting games out there. It works like a horror movie but you can control the outcome if you are good enough. You can play as a killer or survivor with different variants like 3 monsters to choose from and 4 survivors to choose from. The way the game works is as the survivors, you have to turn on 5 generators to escape and help teamates from dieing by a killer there are NO responds once they die they can spectate or leave to a different match. As the killer you can use your special abilities to kill survivors like Traps, Chainsaws, Or going Invisible. Once you down a survivor take them to a hook and hang them on it. You can decide whether to leave to find others or wait for their friends to try to help them. Just don't abuse the camping power cause nobody likes campers if you're a survivor and a teammate is being camped just work on generators there is no use trying to get him.",1
"♥♥♥♥ tons of bugs and worst que system, period. another example of an unrefined game being released.",-1

"it's a really good game and i like very match but its community make it a worse place for people who want to enjoy ,its fun at first and very addictive and you will spend alot of time and maybe it will be your top priority to finish a match and not get abandon from the matches, i suggest it and best way to play dota is it for fun and be careful not to make it consume you",1
AWESOME at first i thought a game to play for 5 min... Its a game to shout at the screen for 5 mins ++++++,1
"First impressions: I invested over an hour in gameplay, but within the first 10 minutes one quickly relizes there are no 'real' choices to make during dialogue sequences. If I were playing this game during the 80's it would hold some interest, but it's extremely outdated. If you enjoy Point &amp; Click games, go with Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father!",-1
"Class RTS, best of the dawn of war series",1
This game takes second favorite platformer ever for me.  Second only to Megaman (sorry mario.),1
"Very nostalgic game, recommended to any person who enjoys the older Cods",1
"The intro shoves you into it without any ability to configure controls, so you have to use this completely unnatural and who the hell came up with that default key configuration anyway. Someone with 3 fingers clearly.  What a mess! No controller support either? Fine guess I'm going to map it out with my controller utility... What the hell... my rider brakes FOR ME!? What the ♥♥♥♥. Can't power through the turns or anything. Practically autopilot... If I wanted training wheels , I would've asked for them!  But my patience and eagerness to see what is beyond, was worth the wait. After the first bull**** mission, you have full access to configure everything. Much better!   Guys seriously, just replace the whole intro mission with a video. Please. That was ridiculous.",1
"Mkay well this is a bit late but the game's nowhere near as scary as the first, so just save your money or buy the dark descent instead Not a bad game, but not very good either",-1
Not as good as Mechwarrior 4,-1
This game is absolutely amazing. Something about it keeps me interested where everything else just leaves me bored. I actually get a sense of fullfillment.  Never before have I been this blown away by the enviorment. The creators of this game did an amazing job with the art. I absolutely love how creative all the creatures are as well.,1
Love it!,1
Great fast-paced action/bullet-hell arcade game with a lot of options for different ships. VERY challenging,1

It was quite slow but over all an amazing game for Dnd fans,1
"GREAT GAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ,IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF DRAGONBALL Z THAN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU . CO-OP IS GREAT AND THE COMMUNITY IS HELPFUL. I ENJOY BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TEAM I LIKE TO KILL LITTLE GOHAN AND GOKU. WILL I EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER DRAGONBALLZ GAME WELL INDEED I WILL. 10/10 WILL KILL GOKU AGAIN.",1
Worth it.,1
It is fun when no russians in your team,1
"It is fantastic. The atmosphere is amazing, the puzzles are great, and the visuals are stunning. I don't understand how this game is free, though I'm certainly not complaining. Very relaxing. I'm not great with riddles or puzzles though I very much enjoy them, so it takes some effort on my part, but I have never felt insanely frustrated with a puzzle (even though I'm currently stuck in the clock room, orz).",1
"The theme and graphics fall into the so bad it may make you vomit, but the game's mechanics are very solid and has stood the test of time as a game with enormous replayability.",1
Still as good as I remembered from when I was a child!,1
"gets old after a while, i mean its just the same game over and over and over :/ but nontheless very fun :D",1
Game is abandoned. It was pretty promising but the devs are actually scum.  DO NOT BUY.,1
this game is rilly fun and its worth the 5$ but there are some bugs and other things like its hard to find health but you get lots of lives that you can recover the money is black coins they could drop more and the useage of them are small but you get chest with good loot most of the time and so far the wost part is that i was fighting glob and he got me in the door way and i wasnt able to move whale getting killed i died but its a good game,1

"We stood in formation on the field of battle. Our leader, General Jeff Van Dy Ke, prepared to give us a rousing speech to steel our hearts against the ruthless foe. The Seganites and Cafanaboys gathered on the other side, polishing their Daggers, Longswords and Clubs, or 'DLC's' as the men called them. 'Men', said the general, 'We have had enough of the cut content, half drunk voice actors, and chaotic campaign AI. We go on the attack to forever save the name of Total War! And remember, our Roman Gods are watching! Make sure they are not ashamed! '  To our horror he was sniped by a flaming catapult from 3 miles away.",-1
"The driving mechanics are poor, but the overall are really great. You can be a total sycho that kills everyone in the street plus everyone in the mission, or be a stealth and unknown city guardian angel that helps everybody and makes all his jobs without taking down enemies.",1
"For an expansion pack, this is amazing. So much new content ! Feels like a new game. I love the way you can create your own avatar, and veteran units. Still haven't played the base game (shogun 2), but will totally check it out now ! GET THIS MEOW !",1
Even thou is a stealth game..the idea of murdering everyone in every mission is a must.  James bond will be proud.,1

This game is awesome!,1
Cant get the game started Keeps coming up with error message on loading. Not happy Jan. Its a problem that has been mentioned a lot on the forum so why no fix as yet.,-1
Loved it,1
"NecroDancer is a very innovative rogulike. It's quite addictive and most importantly, satisfying in so many ways.   + Great soundtracks , you can even customize them  + Simple controls, pick your favourite input device + The difficulty feels just right : almost frustrating, very challenging + Interesting characters and character mechanics + Charming 16-bit style graphics, easy on your eyes + Balanced PvE - there's not much imbalance like level disparity + Okay lore + Dancing mobs + Singing merchant  - Balanced PvE comes with steep learning curve : memorizing patterns, practicing your hand-eye coordination, feeling and being one with the rhythm, identifying enemies, coming up with the best strategy, paying attention to traps, and many more. - One of the initially available character eliminates the whole point of this game. I recommend you to avoid using him at all, unless if you want to train or to familiarize yourself with particular tileset",1
It's fun...ya know!!!!,1
Tis an excellent 2D platformer in all regards.,1
Amazing shooter!!! it would definitely be in my top 10 shooter games of all time,1
"Fantastic game. If you want to experience a character's journey from a fragile spectator to a legendary hero, this is the game. Great graphics, great music, really fun gameplay, light RPG elements. Lara has never been better.",1
"I love the artwork, but the game was a little bit short. There were some glitches here and there, so I had to restart the game couple of times. It's not that bad since the game autosaves frequently.   I enjoyed playing Bulb Boy so much, I'd like to see more!",1
how to stop playing this game?,1
"For the little time I've spent in it so far, Arma 3 has been a great experience.  The singleplayer it comes with has a lot of depth and really shows how great of a mil sim this game is.  Multiplayer is where it's at though. It's like the GMod of realism. Tons of mods and gamemodes to pick from depending on what experience you want. From Battle Royale to Breaking Point to simple PvP gunplay this game packs a ton of experiences to be had.  The only negative I can think of is optimization. I have a pretty modest build and need to crank down settings and do other work arounds for it to run well in multiplayer (It's an easy 60fps in singleplayer, in multi w/ a lot of buildings and players your FPS gets destroyed) but it does need work since I can run games of similar fidelity with better results.  Overall an awesome game; would reccomend to anyone looking for high realism and tons of content.",1
I recommend this game only as a D&amp;D fan. Its about a 5/10 and needs updates and DLC to make it better which Im excited to see. Read my full review below for details   https://xenoearthbound.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/sword-coast-legends/   ,1

"Maybe not a bad game, but it's not a fun game, or a good simulation game.",-1
"When I first saw this game on early access like 2-3 years ago, I was impressed. It looked like a winner and I was right. The visuals are amazing, and its use of a bright color palatte is excellent. Gameplay is fast paced challanginge, and there are many secret areas. I have never played a legend of zelda game, but honestly that is what it feels like, mixed with some samurai jack. So like it's awesome to the power of awesome. Although I will say that the bosses in zones 2 and 3 did not seem as hard as the bosses in zones 1 and 4 and the final boss, but all bosses pale in difficulty to that of playing soccer. Storywise, this game is an excellent example of show don't tell as there is no dialouge, and everything has to be inferred by what you see, including cutscenes and talking with NPCs. I really do love the character designs which are creative The puzzles are quite challanging, and trying to find all the secrets plus new game + gives the game a lot of replayability.  An excellent game that I reccommend whenever it is on sale 8/10.",1
"If you are a fan of RPGs or Final Fantasy, then this is one game that you need to try. The job system allows for some diverse play. The story is good and the graphics are alright for a remake / Port from DS. There are a few bugs which are only a problem if you are going for 100%. For example there is a bug where if you return the pendant from one sidequest before checking your post, you cannot get the post in order to get the Oricalcum (or however it is spelt). The downsides of this game is the possiblity of needing to consult a guide if you forgot what you need to do. Also leveling up jobs can be confusing but once you get used to it, it can be fun,",1
It appears to have been abandoned.,-1
this game is pretty fun it takes strategy to a new level,1
"Disclaimer: I got this game for free because I bought Stock Car Extreme before this game existed.  One of the most enjoyable hardcore racing games to date. No online fees, Minmal DLC releases. Stock, V8 Super, and Go karts... F3, juniors, F1's, and many older ones to boot. The Classic F1 and 86 Opala Chevy I6 Stock Car being my favourite cars to run.   The game uses an upgraded Rfactor engine with great physics and more livly graphics and textures. Clearity @High FPS and any resoloution is always awesome. The modeling is pretty great.   If you can't play anyone online, then why not just get together with a friend and race the Ai Together, it works for me. This is so much better then all those other games that pass them selves off as simulation, such as Asetto Corsa, and Project DLC. All super cars, no soul.  The server system finally works, the Hud is pretty good for such an old game engine, and the controls are solid, just make sure you spend enough time tuning the wheel outside and inside the game and make sure the steering feels just right.",1
"Amazing Prison Management Game where u basically have to make and run your own prison as best as you can so ur prisoners won't start riots or kill ur guards this game is really fun and goes really indepth into the building and managing, the devs made a good job with this game! I LOVE IT!!  Would highly recommend this game! :)  11/10",1
"An overlooked expansion. Doesn't expand Half-Life the way Opposing Force does, but it does EXTEND it. Think of Blue Shift as several more hours of the best gameplay Half-Life had to offer. What's not to love about that?",1
"Pretty fun, takes a bit longer to level up with spending money, but all in all still a pretty fun game!!!!",1
"&gt;me before buying this &gt;crap i'm late &gt;crap, spoilers &gt;me after buying this &gt; . . . &gt; HOLY CRAP   Buy this game. You will love it. I'm not even sure if it's fun, it's just  REALLY GOOD.  30/20  //ALSO DON'T SPOIL ANY OF IT THOUGH I SUPPOSE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT//",1
One of my favourite games! you can play this for hoursin a row!! definitly worth the money,1
"A fun basic romp that's part sim and part rts. It's a mish mash of different gameplay genres.   It's a little bit dated, where graphics and performance are concerned, and once you get the hang of how to play the game, it seems like a fairly linear grindfest where to do X you need to do Y, with very little variation.0  Also be warned that the main resource in this game is your time. You're always waiting on something or other, whether its for more minions to be trained up, stealing money to be completed, plotting to uncover new world objectives, or just waiting for pesky agents to leave you alone or give you room to do what you need to do. You're going to be clicking things for about 10 seconds and then waiting a few minutes for the payoff with nothing to do - thank god for steam overlay and the fact that it doesn't pause the game when you go into it.  All and all though, it's not a bad little game. I've sunk about 80 hours into it. I'm not sure if I'm proud or ashamed of that fact.",1
I LOVED THIS GAME.! Voice acting is great for an indie game.. really shines.! the story is also great and inspired me to write a short story in it's universe.. GET THIS GAME.!,1
AWSUM PAWSUM LOL,1
Good times. Good times. Fun background comments always get me laff'n,1
"After 600+ hours on this game, I'd rate 420.7/69.1  I love the 3dness of this game and the stone armour and tools are really good. Skeletron is a very good NPC and I also think the eye of cthulu is by far the best beat-boxer. The soundtrack is the best hardcorde dubstep I've ever heard, gotta love the bass drops, it made me eat my cuddly toy. Also got to love the Vortex armor with it's added eating skills. Banter.  But being serious, I think this is one of the best games of the decade. Nice job Re-Logic. :)",1
Assassin's Creeds ports to pc were never too good but this one is the lowest they have gone. This game suffers from fps problems. Would not recomend buying this title just now if you dont have a 780 ti or better graphic's card. The day one patch was released one day later then it should have been released. The patch fixed cut scene fps drops but the gameplay fps is still a bit wonkey. Had to turn AA off and graphic's to high with my TITAN. Story is intresting atleast to this point but a little bit predictable at times. When they fix the fps problems then I would recommend this title but until then I would pass.,-1
nostalgia + still one of the best gta games :),1
"I loved Wings for the Amiga back in the day and this is a perfect update for nostalgia junkies.   The game plays exactly like it did back then and aside from updated visuals, VO and music, nothing has changed. Is that a good or a bad thing? Both, I guess.   Back in 1992 or whenever I first played it,I was wowed by the aerial combat and found missions to be interesting and varied. The cinematic presentation was gorgeous and engaging. Today? Well... It still plays well, but it does get repetetive pretty quickly. Gameplay is pretty shallow and there are only three types of missions, all of which you will master in your first few tries.   Min you, I still enjoy playing it. Not sure if that is the nostalgia speaking or what.  STILL, this is a very faithfull remaster and for anyone looking to relive old memories it's a no-brainer. For new players though? hmmm. Jury's still out on that one. Wouldn't mind seeing an expanded follow up with new mechanics and mission types.",1
its maybe good for if you are in the military but not as an game to play on free time,-1
"Terrific game. The 3D spatial aspect of Infinifactory sets it apart from other similar games, giving you a more natural way of looking at things. You'll find that the variety of levels keeps you playing, and sometimes even coming back to optimize your solutions. If you're undecided, watch one video of a level and you'll either be immediately turned off due to the style of game, or you can know you'll like it.",1
"holy ♥♥♥♥ where do i start. so i start downloading this game on my 1mbps connection. everything goes smooth. until it downloads, then it proceeds to tell me i have to restart my pc? in 2016??? i dont rhink so(although i have an ssd i'm not restarting my pc) i make a character and all the faces are black? i make a rogue then everything else is good max settings runs fine. then we get into the second room and there's no mobs? the 2 npcs are hitting the floor. i'm like ok let me restart the game. nothing i make a new char still nothing. there's no report a bug ingame i'm not spending my own time going on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ website for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that looks like ♥♥♥♥ and i cant even play it? how am i supposed to play if i cant even see the mobs? DO NOT EVEN bother downloading this horrible mess of a 'game'",-1
"Mass Effect is my second favorite franchise of all time, but I played it first on Xbox. On PC with mods it's like new again! Even my favorite game (Civ) I wouldn't recommend more than this franchise. Great, great games!",1
I've played this game quite a lot while on vacation. Pretty cool!,1
"Recently got this game, never played ot before as the idea of playing this is sad . . . but then i found a depth of challenge and tactics which i just cant stop trying to improve on. Its really great . . and i dont care about looking sad and being called a nerd virgin and all that. Im too old to care what kids think anyway",1
"Easy to follow yet still makes you think on your feet. I have really enjoyed this game so far, and it does a good job of teaching the logic necessary when working with computers (particularly with networking).",1
Great strategy game!,1
"I really really like this game - and I'm a grunty and generally hard-to-please-person when it comes to computer games.   The idea is fresh and well executed. I love the idea of a RPG in a historical setting mixed with logistics/survival. The characters' plausability is is very good as there is none of the stereotyping and overdrawing that games usually suffer from. The dialogues/descriptions are really good - I hardly ever got tired reading them, I had some real interest in them, unlike in other text-driven games where text is mainly used to fill pauses in between engine/combat action. The 'quests' were quite good. Even though one can't completely prevent 'quuests' like 'get there to get that and come back', these quests were pleasantly rare and often had some interesting spice in them - You don't want to give me that idol, boy? What do you want to do with that knive?! ...Bang! (Yes, I'm playing a rather hard and proud in his own 'superiority' conquistador).  The art and most of the presentation of the game is so refreshingly 'sober/serious' and historically inspired. My eyes - grown so tired of stylized fantasy stuff - have rejoiced. The loading screens and the character portraits - awesome! The music was also nice, although in the end on Hispaniola, I would have wished for 1 or 2 more tracks (might have been related with the fact that I spend a bit more playing time in Hispaniola than other players, whoose parties did not die a slow death in the jungle). However, the maps themselves were a bit of a weakpoint for me. I would have prefered a 2D map. 3D serves no purpose other than creating camera-movement-issues in a game like this. I hope that some day all companies will notice that 3D is not inherently better than 2D but just an alternative. A good (ideally manually drawn) 2D map can beat any 3D map and adds historical flair on top of that. But not to make a wrong impression here: overall immersion was very very good, but I think that the 3D overland-map didn't quite fit to the 'serious' approach of the game. So don't let yourself be fooled by the rather naive 3d graphics. This game is one of the least hollywood-like, most refreshingly sober and realistic ones I've ever played.  The battles are simple but nice. Of course there are always ways to make battles 'deeper', but overall I think the battle mechanics fit into the games' 'total package' rather well. What I especially liked is that success in battle does not require you to hyper-customize your soldiers skills and gear. I'm so thankfull that I do not have to look at weapon-stats, armour-parts and complicated skill trees. I'm happy that this game is free of that fantasy-hyper-customization. The choice of skills is nice and sufficient. I also like that characters do not get 'too' specialized. A human being carrying a weapon is a thread to any other human being. I really love that the differences between the classes are not exagerated. It adds to the feeling of plausibility and realism, just like the treatment of wounds and injuries.   I have to say I also love that the game is not too easy, especially in the beginning (playing on normal mode so far). Since my party has arrived in Mexico, I feel that it probably is a bit too easy. But my first group ended somewhere in the jungles of Hispaniola. The 4 guys that were still left after some deaths and a mutiny (I didn't dare to click on the boars for too long *lol*, so I had a bit of a food-problem) were all wounded by the rebels and - wounded without medicine - died a slow death.",1
"This game is great, and I'd suggest playing with a controller, but...    It's destroyed a £7 PC controller (Loose left stick), and seems to be on the verge of destroying a PS2 controller (Loose right stick)...    The character customisation options are pretty neat, allowing quite a fair amount of freedom. You can pick between an Earthling, Saiyan, Majin, Namekian and a member of Frieza's Race (The last two being without specific gender options).    I think the gameplay plays like the Budokai Tenkaichi games (Never really played those too much, more of a Budokai fan), but anyway, the game does feel like you are a character in DBZ.    I recommend this, but maybe get some more controllers :D",1
Interesting story with cute characters. Music is really good. Battle mechanics are unique for an RPG. I recommend it.,1
"Can become a little repetitive, but there are unlocks to help spice some things up. Very fluid and very polished. Definitely worth getting on sale. It will probably keep you busy for 6-8 hours, there's not much replay value in my opinion. Solid game.",1
"Analogue: A Hate Story isn't the kinda thing you'd normally expect to pop up on Steam. It's a visual novel, which means there's loads of reading, some pretty graphics and sounds, and very little in the way of what some may think of as actual 'gameplay.' Don't let that detract you if you like a good narrative that slowly unravels itself from the middle as you access various log files and interact with two very distinct AI personalities to uncover their pasts as well as the truths behind their society's downfall.   Saying much more would ruin the experience, so just take my word for it (because I'm awesome, so why wouldn't you?) that Analogue is definitely unique and immersive enough to merit more than a passing glance.   ",1
I love this game and all the random fun it brings. Definitely a great game to play with friends.,1
This beats COD right on their boots. CS:S is the king of FPS! &lt;3,1

Without a doubt, the perfect example of how an RPG must be. best experience so far!! Freedom to do whatever and you'll always have something to do ;) CD PROJEKT RED did and does a great work! :D  Just play and you will know!  ",1
"I'm a huge fan of platformers and Metroidvanias. I want to like the game but simply cannot get over how bad the controls are. The entire game reeks of an almost pretentious 'look how hard this game is! look at the obscure everything!' but the foundation, its platforming, is a trainwreck. Not worth a purchase at any price imo. If a platformer can't get its act together and have decent controls, it's not worth your time. there are difficult games out there that are hard for the right reasons and not because you have to wade through molasses to solve puzzles that provide almost no feedback as to your progress.",-1

"I grew up playing baldurs gate and baldurs gate 2. This game feels very much like those earlier renditions. The plot is engaging, and it truly feels like a classic RPG for the PC. So far I have only beaten it on normal, but I very much plan to play through again with a different class and with a different style which is the beauty of this game. You do feel like your choices are having an impact on people in the world react to your character. I highly recommend this game to anyone who played the old school rpgs.",1

"  Magical adventures and rescue of a family member are common tropes in hidden object games, and  Mythic Wonders The Philosopher's Stone  follows that formula. Step into the shoes of Emma as she tries to find her uncle but unwittingly gets dragged into a magical adventure. This game is beautifully done with a lot of unique puzzles and hidden object scenes to keep you busy. Are you ready to find the Philosopher’s Stone?  Emma and her uncle have been working on a magical portal but one night she is awoken by a nightmare and fears her uncle is in danger. What she finds when she arrives is an empty house- and that he has gotten the portal to work. She steps through the looking glass and enters new and wondrous lands on her search to find him. Throughout your journey you will find clues about your uncle as well as get ominous warnings from the enigmatic Guardian. With the Philosopher’s Stone in hand, you bend nature to your will and solve the mysteries surrounding your uncle’s disappearance.  This title is a point and click game, you use your mouse to walk, select objects, talk to people and interact with the scenes. As you travel through the game you will have to get through many puzzles, most range from easy to moderate in terms of difficulty. There are also hidden object scenes as well. They are the traditional type: A list of items that you have to find as well ones where you see the shape of the object you’re looking for and have to find it in the scene. I found the variety very pleasant and felt that it kept things fresh. There are also “morphing objects” to find as you travel along, as their name suggests they morph from one shape to another and can be hard to spot at times.  Visually the game is gorgeous, lovely backgrounds, well done hidden object scenes though some require a bit of squinting. The user interface is also well done, matching the aesthetics of the game. The animation of the characters in the game is decent but it could be better, movements are stiff and mouth movements are underwhelming. The game also uses music that fits each scene, helping to create a very mystical vibe or adding to the drama where it’s needed.  I was very pleased with  Mythic Wonders The Philosopher's Stone , despite any flaws I may have found it’s overall a lovely game. Since this is the collector’s addition you also have an added bonus chapter as well, extending your game play. Replayable hidden object scenes and mini games are also apart of the bonus content, as well as concept art, wallpapers and music. There are also Steam achievements and trading cards to enjoy making this a well-rounded game to add to your library.   Lunar Productions  [lunarproduction.com] ",1

"L.A. Noire is an instant classic. The settiing, theme, art direction, and music are terrific. You play as one of the only straight men in a crooked town, and it's on you to overcome your own personal failings and help clean up the city. The story is extremely compelling, and if you just feel like exploring the wonderfully designed city, a la GTA 1940s LA, you can do that too. A must play.",1
"The premier medieval city administration simulator. I think that says it all. This is not really a standard city builder. You basically spend most of your time manageing your citizens and making sure that they survive. There is no porgression or tech, you just start out with 20 some odd buildings and a virgin land to settle in. The fun of the game is really in figuring out how produce enough food/tools/clothes/medicine/etc to prevent everyone from dying. After that initial phase it is then about seeing how large you can get your city. There aren't any massive building projects and the game really lacks on aesthetics. You spend most of your time carefully placing buildinds, watching your supplies, and managing how many people are in each profession. If that sounds interesting then it's deffinately worth the buy.",1

"As a lover of point and click adventures, I'm ashamed to say that I'd never played a Sherlock Holmes game before. So in an effort to correct this, I started playing Versus Ripper without much pre-knowledge of what the gameplay or quality of the game was actually like. Oh boy, was I in for a surprise?  I loved this game. Although some of the production values may now be rather dated, I feel that they added to the charm. The puzzles weren't difficult, but just hard enough to make you feel that you actually had something to solve. While the voice acting over all was nothing compared to a AAA nowadays, the characterizations of Holmes &amp; Watson perfectly fit into everything you could wish for. The Ripper story itself took a fascinating perspective on the historical events.  Apparently this is one of the best of the Sherlock games, so it's all downhill for me from here (though I'm definitely going to play through the whole series), but I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody that likes point and click adventures, murder mysteries, or just generally doesn't need AAA production values to appreciate a game.",1

The campaign features a diverse set of locals ranging the African, Eastern, and Western Fronts, and still remains fun to this day. Multiplayer is fair, with a multitude of quality maps. The servers for COD 2 are dead on consoles, so it is nice to see a small but active community thriving on steam. Definitely worth a purchase and its the best COD in the series.",1

"Viking Squad is not Castle Crashers.   It has similar mechanics, but falls short big time.  The 'lane' style mechanism for hitting your enemies works well with enemies who do not fly; good luck hitting a bat carrying a bomb.  The grinding to level your character up is the same mechanic to level up weapons and gear. It utilizes treasure that you must find or treasure pick ups from fallen boss enemies. If you travel back to existing areas and try to 're-fight' the bosses to 're-aquire' the treasure to level up, you get USELESS COINS instead. At least in Castle crashers you would still get XP in any fighting condition against any boss fight in the game. LAAAAME.  Recycled boss's and the levels layouts are re-used. Seems the developer took shortcuts everywhere.   Want a new 'beat em up that isnt a waste of time? Get Mother Russia Bleeds and avoid this one.  Played for over 2 hours, just enough time to not get a refund.",-1
The best mil-sim which is available on the market! I ended up in a big firefight in the middle of a dried up salt lake. Nowhere to hide and guns blazing all around us. I called in a CAS run and a jet came flying by with hundreds of explosive grenades. We then found out our car was dry. We were running down the salt lake with mortars exploding next to us. We intercepted a big convoy and jumped into a truck which took us home  10/10 would run through massive battlefield again,1
How can you not be playing this game?   One of the best strategy games ever. (in my opinion),1
Got 4 generators  Save my teamates 4 times  get hit by the killer and go on the hook and i die   ...feels great man just great :D  Either way this game is awesome,1
I like this game! very funny to see in a life of a farmer. and they have more realisitc people in the game. its rly cool this game ! 9/10! buy it if you love farming sims!,1
game of the year,1
Great game. Highly recommended.,1

"I received this title as part of a bundle, but the idea of playing the other side of the item shop seemed neat so I gave it a shot. The game makes clear quite early that you're expected to pour your time into it - perhaps that's what the 'casual' moniker means? Either way, after crafting a dozen weapons or so, and opening up a new location, I decided I wanted to get off of the ride.",-1
"Anyone with a Facebook page should play this. Great commentary on the age of the internet where privacy may very well be just an illusion we feed ourselves. It's also an interesting twist on the idea of a power fantasy. You don't have big guns or magic powers, you have personal information of everyone at your finger tips. And information is power no?  Be prepared tho for a somewhat guided experience. To keep the story in line, there are only chosen lines of text that you can pick out, but you still have the power to pick whether or not you include some of them. Main issue I have with this otherwise smart game is that it's a little difficult to keep track find data you chose to not pick out because you previously thought it wasn't relevant. And it's kinda hard to tell what data will move the story forward vs what is data that you can leave out to change the outcome.",1

"DO NOT BUY!!! there are only 2/3 of the x-wing games released here. The classic 93 floppy version, which has poor graphics, no speech, and poor sound and the 98 CD version that has better graphics but is otherwise gutted and not playable. If you want the best version of this game, I recommend buying a CD of the 94 version on amazon or ebay and run it on dosbox.",-1
"Omg, what have they done to trine?   Frozen Byte made this game from an old school 2.5 D game into a 2.75 D game. You can freely walk back and forth and left and right, but the camera stays at a fixed point. It is as wanky as it sounds. Worst of all, there are no invis. walls at the end of the map. You can freely walljump onto backgroundwalls just to fall outside of the map and instantly die. If you could jump somewhere in T1/2 you'd be sure there to be secrets. Here it's just bad gamedesign that let's you basically wall jump EVERYWHERE.  With that the platforming is beyond junky. If you have to jump on a platfrom in the distant you never know if you jump slightly in front or behind it.   To the 3 heroes: They lost all their advanced abilities and skill trees. Only one box for the wizard, basic arrows for the rogue. The knight feels like a machine in comparison: Shield, charge, stomp, crush, push, you name it. And since you can basically wall jump everywhere you are almost all the time the knight.   The progression has also been ruined. Remember those experience orbs that unlocked abilities? Well they are now mendatory and unlock the next level... of which there are 8 in total. WTF!  This game is like a alpha of a game, or a demo at most.   I wanted this game to be good! Really. I even bought it despite all the bad reviews, thinking: 'It can't be that bad. People are only butthurt because it isn't strict 2.5D anymore.' Well ♥♥♥♥ me, it is that bad.  It's a shame, since the look and the feel and the sound is still Trine and as gorgeous as ever. But then you see the knight clip through walls and the image is ruined.   This game is 3/10. Not unplayble but a buggy mess that is not fun to sit through. If they fix some of the more annoying issues with the game it becomes 4-5/10. If they even add some more content (For free i might add) to the game it would be even 6/10... maybe.  Don't buy this game!",-1
"Great game but repetitive.   It sounded as if there was only 1 right ending to get which is true, however, I was expecting the true ending to be something hard to get. I assumed that you just had to keep trying out different choices till you found the right ending but no.  Either way I think I got my moneys worth out of it.",1

"Working well for me. I've set the mouse sensitivity to 13%.  The game's good so far but when I came to my first boss fight, the game just ended. I just started uncovering the story and ... that's it. Very disappointing ending. I hoped they'd finish the main story without DLCs but it appears you will need to buy some DLC to continue it.",1

"Rated as a buy because, imo, I got enough out of it to justify the cost.  That said I uninstalled halfway through the game. Your milage may vary but I had reached the point of feeling no incencetive to contine grinding.   The Positives  Sound, visuals, and play are all solid.   The Neutral  'Ship of the Line' playstyle. As stated elsewhere you, and other dominate craft, are restricted to the X axis. Everything except small fighters are built around this orientation. I wasn't bothered by it on the whole but there are moments when the limitation can be frustrating.   The Negatives  While not everyone will find this a negative Rebel Galaxy is, at its core, a power creep grinder. The process is as follows --- complete requested or accepted jobs in the flavor of bounties, transport, or escort &gt;&gt;&gt; Get paid &gt;&gt;&gt; Buy a new ship and or uprade the current ship systems in .X version increments of essentially the same type &gt;&gt;&gt; Jump from system to system facing simiarly and incresingly upgraded ships &gt;&gt;&gt; Spend the time inbetween traveling from and to all these various points.

When playing, you must keep an open mind to this new way of not only playing a game, but experiencing it as well. The graphics are gorgeous and I hope to see more games like this in the future. I cannot reccommend this game enough!",1
800+ hours and still learning new moves. It is easy to learn but hard to master  69/11 ,1
"The game itself is pretty good, the customization is brilliant and the graphics look fluid and smooth, that seems the only thing it has going for it. There doesnt seem to be any updates or content coming to it any time soon, paying players and veteran players will destroy you and its fairly unbalanced but that's to be expected in any F2P games. The last thing that bugged me was the in-game currency and gun cost, sure you can afford same weapons as paying players but it will take a LONG time. You only get about 200 coins per win and 100 per lost with guns and armor costing over 6000 coins so get ready to die for very often. My final judgement would be to try it if you want to grind for a bit and stick to one gun/armor.",1
"Me personally, like cooking games. I have tried out to many, but I like this one.  I only think one thing is missing. I want to be able to upgrade and decorate my place.",1
"Look, alot of people are complaining about the pricing (and they should it is not something I hope continues in the future), but for what the regular game ships with I would consider plenty. With 15 playable characters (i am including the three monsters) each with their own abilities, large maps (that have time of day and weather cycles) with a variaty of game modes, and (with a few exeptions) a balanced game that I couldn't ask for much more. It is a very fun game that I have put about 10hrs into the retail release (and at least a few more from all the betas). and I am still excited to jump into each game. I fully believe what shipped with the game is plenty enough to make it a worth while purchase. However I will refrain from buying DLC as I consider, like most, that what they have done for dlc is a large money grab and not in the consumers intrest. I don't think that should be enough to stop people from purchaseing the main game as it provides enough content for the money you are spending! HAPPY HUNTING!!!!",1

"This game was one of my childhood favourites, and inspired my interest in history, especially history surrounding the nomadic empires of Atilla and Genghis. The gameplay is fairly standard when it comes to RTS gameplay, you start with your Town Hall and a few workers and micromanage said workers untill you've got a town large enough to build a sufficient army to take on your foes.  Personally I never got very invested in the multiplayer, which is why I'm glad to say the singleplayer is very extensive with campaigns surrounding certain wars that were fought in times long past, for instance the rise of the mongol empire, and the events that unfolded when spaniards first set foot on aztec lands. I wouldn't say the game is 100% historically accurate, but the campaigns are definitely based around real events.  Beyond that, all and all I think it's a fun game, the HD edition doesn't add to much beyond making everything look a bit smaller, but nothing too upsetting, atleast it lets me play Age of Empires 2 again, a game I'd gladly pay for to relive.  Word of warning though, I have come across a lot of issues with the expansion 'The Forgotten', and as it was based around a mod for the original game, a lot of the AI feels clunkier. (The AI will spawn tons of units in their fortress and the campaigns can feel more like a grind than usual), and the pathing is sometimes difficult to manage. There's also the issue of invisible walls in favour of pacing, which all comes down to your personal preference.  All in all I love the original game, and due to that I can bare The Forgotten's campaigns, but if you're trying this for the first time I'd recommend starting off with the game without the dlc.",1
Best Bang for the buck I've ever had.,1
this game is absolutely amazing the graphics are awesome just its the same map as saints row 3 the dubstep gun is awesome i would pay $100 for this game its awesome you get to choose a whole bunch of things i love it and the superpower part is awesome you can jump extremely high run really fast throw balls of fire and ice to burn or freeze people to death the missions are so fun i would spend 24 hours a day on this but unfortunatly i cant so if youre looking towards buying this game definitly get it its amazing you wont regret it,1
"Mirror's Edge is one of my all-time favorite PC games. The style, the eligance, the graphics, and the gameplay kept me coming back for more. The challenges were so much fun. I'll be standing by to pre-order the long awaited Mirror's Edge II as soon as it becomes available.",1

"Doesn't have much replay value, but Outlast is an excellent horror game. The game is stressful, frightening and exciting. Not just cheap jumpscares either, the atmosphere is perfect. Plays very well, runs well, no complaints. No game breaking glitches that I've encountered. There is one tiny ledge that you have to jump from at one part about 3/4 through the game that I had a hard time doing because the game refused to detect that I had jumped across which resulted in me falling to the previous floor again. and again. and again. Other than a few minutes of frustration at that one part I had no issues. Interesting plotline. There's also a decent dlc out now which isn't bad. Definately one of my favorite horror games. 10/10",1

LOVED IT!,1
one of the WORST games i ever played ....,-1
So just finished Venetica and one might say i am confused when it comes to really recommend or not.  Here is why: Cons: The eternal crash randomly bug is living within this game like an eternal pleague. This means that randomly whenever you walk into a new area the game might randomly crash or glitch on you for no reason at all or sometimes the world you enter will be glitchy as f. But all you have to do is restart the game and this honestly might be what breaks it for people in general. Another con i will give this game is the cheesiest lines every invented in some of these dialogues it makes me want to scratch my head and just not listen to it because its so cringy. 3 con would be the lack of instructions on different things like using different items and such which you just have to figure out as you go.  Pros (yeah i actually thought it had some):1 I loved the gameplay and how you esentially become a necromancer but all this of course depends on how you use your skills.2 The skill tree is fun to play with and i advice figuring out if you want to go the pure necromancer/mage way or the fighter way or even a mix before you go too far into the game. 3 The way you fight is easy to understand and feels smooth. The cheesy lines aside the story is good and original and the way they create an entire new Venezia is one of the reason i decided to big this interesting game.  As a conclusion its your patience that decides wether you scrap this game to dust or take it up and have the fun you can have. Since i will say this you will be restarting the game a good amount of times though i never had it crash at critical points it mostly crashes when i go in or out from areas. Buy it when it goes for sale is probably the wisest decision but for me the story and gameplay made it one of those rare hidden games. So i will recommend because the gameplay outweighted the bugs and clitches that pops up.,1
"Continental Philosophy: The Game!  ...or maybe not. I don't mind admitting I didn't completely get what this game was trying to impart. Something profound about metaphysics, I think.  Despite this, it's well worth a play if you liked Dear Esther, which it greatly resembles. It's a 'walking simulator' through and through, so you have to like the genre (and I do).  At their best, the environments in this game are breathtaking - really inventive. Other parts look like a sewer level from Half-Life.  Games of this sort often use the 'found book' method for exposition, and The Old City turns this up to 11. There are screens and screens of stuff - most of which I skimmed. Luckily, none of this is required for finishing the game (phew). If you read all the books in Skyrim you'll be like a pig in ____ here :)   ",1
"It's a very basic online multiplayer game. No frills, just a lot of fun.",1
"Alpha Review: Good game BUT. its fun if you're into E-sports, and the idea of playing the monster is awesome.  I crushed those cockroaches countless times. Curious to see how it develops but for right now the mechanics of the monsters are sort of clunky and the gameplay has the potential to get really boring. It'll also be hard for them to match players correctly. The monster always needs to be more experienced and ahead of the other 4 in terms of knowing the map and play skills, if that isnt the case, it can get very boring very quickly, as the monster will pose no challenge to the other 4. It's not only about making the monster tougher in terms of how hard it hit or how hard it is to kill. the player behind the monster needs to be more skilled and smarter than the others to make it a interesting. As I don't expect this is easy to determine, it might take a while, to create a good balance, and the game might only become really good at a competitive level. 4 minds will generally always surpass the 1. which is why almost all games match players in equal numbers. Let's see how this pans out.",1
Tried being a sneaky lad and got 360 no scoped randomly by an enemy. Said f*** it and went in spraying and got 360 no scoped randomly.  10/10 best video game of all time,1
"It's literally like rotmg. Though I like the pathway it is going,",1
"The player starts in the middle of action without any hint of what is going on. Soon, he will put put pieces together revealing the past events and the main plot. The story is great and the amazing voice acting really contribute for the storytelling. Also, the art creates a beautiful futuristic immersive city.  The combat machanics are very addicting combining elements of strategy/rpg and real time action. The game offers a lot of ways to aproach battle and it's a lot of fun testing the different combinations of skills and planning every move.  And the music - oh! The music! - The soundtrack perfectly blends with the mood, the plot and the gameplay and the songs are responsible for the greatest moments of the game (What a voice!). It could have a bit more of exploration, but this doesn't interfere with the experience. Great game, I recommend.",1
"Really fun game, lots of hours with fun!",1
"Edios learnt from their mistakes from the first sequel, and they released polished succesor, Hitman: Silent Assassin. Really satisfying expirience, and endless replayability because there are so much ways to complete a mission. Definitely not linear.   Only thing that bugs me is that when you run in disguise everyone starts looking at you suspiciously because they probably have probably never seen a special agnet running.  Get it. It's worth it.",1

"Best $1.50 spent on steam , exept for Blockstorm when it was .99. ",1
I've been playing for almost two hours and I can say this..... THIS GAME IS AMAZING AF!!!!!,1
"I remember when I first got this as a bootleg version that lacked so many things. You couldn't save, it didn't have all the sounds, no movies, not all options and yet I loved it. When I finally found the game and Cataclysm, I immediately bought them both. Playing the game as it was meant to for the first time was great. Now that game is back, better than ever. I recommend this game for everyone who likes RTS games, for this brought true 3D RTS into to market and no one has done it better ever since. And don't even get me started on the modding culture on this one. Before the Remastered version the mods were plenty but now with the Workshop here in Steam the mods are flying wild.",1
LOVE this game &lt;3 &lt;3 until we can nep-nep or noir-noir again,1
"Promising game, great visuals, some story, but:  1. Lots of mechanics that are clearly broken, like sectors, warscore, AoE weapons (they are not actually AoE despite UI saying so). Some features are useless (missiles), some are overpowered. Looks like game was rushed and those were inserted as placeholder. Some crucial features, like espionage, never made it into release at all. Patches address this by quick-and-dirty decisions (like arbitrary limit on point-defense guns on ship or limiting each ship size to one battle strategy). 2. Frustrating and fiddly UI (subspecies management, fleet splitting, army management). To build a proper army, you have to manually click every unit and add an attachment, which is very low-cost and has no drawback. Only problem is clicking a lot. 3. No real depth to the game. No supply mechanics, just build anywhere. Only viable strategy for war is doomstacking. Fortificating is useless because even top-tier space defense station can be easily overcome by contemporary fleet, most it can do is shoot down unarmed transports being carelessly sent by AI. 4. Events are interesting, deep and varied, but all scripted and you get the same ones every game (mostly), Gets boring after first time. 5. Performance gets AWFUL into late game. Expect slow-death. 6. AI is dumb, sending numerous unarmed fleets to their death. Only way it can win is via cheating which is called 'difficulty setting'. 7. Most of the game is spent micromanaging your planets, ensuring the best positioning of buildings. You have to process each planet manually to achieve good returns, but you can't keep them all under manual control so you have to give them out to 'sectors'. Having only small pool of planets to manage yourself results in frustrating fiddling with sectors. Otherwise you have at best sub-par performing planets, at worst AI management causes happiness to drop and sectors revolt.  Free updates are ongoing, but while fixing stuff they kinda break game even further. With recent warscore changes and messing with sectors it's nigh unplayable. And they are already rolling out paid DLC without fixing basic mechanics. Stay away unless in far future they patch this mess up.",-1
I play this game in 2003 from my grandfather computer. But he only allow me to play this game when i get good grade. Now i can play it freely =)),1
"This game raises a lot of intresting questions on the effects of social media on relationships. How focusing on what could have been rather than what could ruin the future. I like the game overall, there is one huge flaw I found with the tennure of the game which I will list below, considering it has some spoilers I suggest playing through the game before reading, it will only take an hour, and at the very least it's an intresting perspective, even though I feel if this game was given a budget a lot more could be done to explore it's concepts and themes.    Suggestion to make it better (slight spoilers): I felt the ending is right, it has a great punch and really makes you think however, I think you should be able to focus on you're relationship with Emma. I feel like like if you go through with ditching Emma you have chosen a future, rather than finding out what could have been with a nice fresh stable relationship. I feel the message is hurt by no matter what you do the game essentailly ending in a fail state. If you could chose Emma, sure you may have a fail state with Emily, but a prospurous relationship with Emma. If you can't end up with Emma, why would you chose to spend time with her over Emily. By allowing an ending a choice where you chose Emma, you admit that you may have at one point loved Emily, however, so much time has past and you have a good thing going, you know that spending time with this old flame could jepordize your relationship with Emma, so you have an actaul choice, do you sacrafice the thing you have now for a chance at a missed opurtunity in the past that is a wild card, or do you stay with the sure thing the girl that is in your life now and wants you now.",1

"Check out my complete Let’s Play  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ3E4yWDjV8   1917 – The Alien Invasion harkens back to the old arcade cabinet era of shoot em’ ups. Based on an alternative timeline where Aliens invade Earth during WW1. You play as Dr. Brunhield Stahlmüller who upgrades the traditional bi-plane to take the fight to the aliens. Featuring 5 levels, the difficulty balance felt right, it started simple and the final level was challenging. Shmup (shoot ‘em up) veterans might find this game easy, but for beginners or the intermediates (like me) it felt just right. The music is catchy if you love electronic beats, and the alien designs are inspired and quite grotesque. Despite being a very basic story, the ending was actually interesting despite stories not being important at all for this style of game. There is only one type of weapon which can be upgraded, and just a warning, when you die you start at the beginning of the level. Definitely recommend for shmup fans.

"Turns into Borderlands 3. Quests turn into kill and loot. Gunplay is awesome but there is so much lacking everywhere else. Hate me, but if anyone liked the hardcore mode in NV or just weapon degredation in general then they should not get this game. It's definitely the Skyrim of TES series. So you'll have a lot of fun for the first 40 hours, but after that you become an all around unstoppable tank that can use any and all weapons to maximum efficiency. I miss min-maxing a character and seeing my character's strengths grow and his/her weakness become a huge challenge to overcome. The voice acting is nice, but shallows out so much choice. Also there's no reason why I should feel sad for my family or honestly have a desire to go after my son. My character cares but why should I? Other reviews sum it up moreso than I did. It's a fun game, but definitely not a Fallout game.",-1
"This is a really fun isometric puzzle game where you play as a killer named Skullface that keeps returning to Slayaway Camp for more BLOOD AND REVENGE!!! It is very creative with lots of different killing scenes and more killers to unlock like krampus, gremlins, ect. (You need the DLC to be able to unlock some extra characters like these as well as extra levels). As you play through the levels they get harder and harder with different mechanics being added to keep you sucked in and enthralled! This game is very addicting and so satisfying when you kill each victim and get to watch a killing cut scene that is short and random. This game is deffinately worth your time, money, and attention!   10/10 Will saw someone in half over and over again XD",1
"This game is great. Despite the fact it has been on steam for over 9 years, it still has an active community and is still being updated to this day. You do get some limitations if you dont buy something off the store but all you need is £0.33 and you can get premium and deny those restrictions. This game has 9 different classes with their own different types of play styles and many different ways of playing them. This game needs teamwork too. While there arent many medics on public servers usually they are key to survival. But you dont need a medic to win. For example the engineer can build many buildings to assist his fellow mercenaries. Finally dont be afraid to use the microphone. While there may be an odd ♥♥♥♥ or two there will always be 10 more nice people out there. This game has a very friendly community with the odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you can simply leave and join another server. I highly recommend this game and it is essential for any steam libary.",1

And I just realized: This is Classic Castlevania, let me explain: You are Simon/Trevor/Alucard (Dracula's Vampire Son), with a whip of leather/chain, that goes to defeat Dracula in a 2D castle. I didn't like the lack of characters, twelve character (Five of them only appear in the intro cinematic) and I do not count a description on the bestiary as a character. The main characters are, of course, Simon, Trevor Belmont, and Alucard. You play each Act with one of them. The other two characters are Dracula, the antagonist, and Gabriel Belmont, whom you play in the tutorial. And the last two characters are the Succubus, a boss who show a little bit of personality, and the Daemon Lord, a boss who appears like four times, and has more personalities than most.   As I said like seventy words ago, the bestiary has one paragraph for each monster and boss, which is nice, considering the giant amount of entries there is, but the problem/feature is that each monster has a scroll you have to find, also there are dead knights with a little story you can search for. The exploration consists of a lot of backtracking, as you gain new abilities, like in Act I (Simon) you change your leather whip to a chain whip with the abilities to swing on grappling spots (like in Super Castlevania IV, in which you also play as Simon) and many new areas are accessible. Or when you get the double jump in Act II (Alucard). Your arsenal consists of your whip, which every time you level up you gain a new combo, the subweapons, which run on ammo(you pick up ammo by enemies’ drop or breaking barrels), and two magics, which vary.   Alucard was the best character by far, because he didn't breathe, so I could explore the water for more scrolls, his whip can swing from the ledges and chandeliers from the beginning, his magics are mist form (Default Q) which can dash-teleport, and if you do it through enemies you get your health back, and the wolf form (Default E) which causes more damage, he can also double jump and glide, he has claws for wall 2D wall-jumping. His subweapons are a time-slowing device and a bat-swarm (so you you can pretend you're Batman), and he can also take a skyline-like device to travel more.   At the end of the day, is it fun? Well yes, I enjoyed it, spend many hours on it, and I will recommend it to everyone who enjoyed Super Castlevania IV. You can't get really affectionate with the characters, since the only reason they have is revenge, but the combat is fluid, and the new skills fuse with exploration without you really noticing, except for one, which is almost crowbared in (Simon's Crossbow Ghost), but everything else made places I never thought of exploring accessible, so I like it.",1
"Oh Alan Wake where do I start? When I originally picked it up it was on the recommendation of a friend and I waited until it was on sale. After playing the main campaign which although is short, I would have happily paid the full price. The game is inspired mainly by two shows “Twin Peaks” and “The Twilight Zone” and it is packed full of pop culture references. Although it starts off slow and the writing may appear slightly weak it picks the pace up fast and becomes incredibly gripping. Id totally recommend this game for anyone who loves TV in general. I’m going to keep this short. But honestly if you like TV and certain directs e.g David Lynch buy this game! ",1
"Simply put: Graphics are bad, but THE GAME is UNBELIEVABLE  This game has over 100 mods and at least 20 of those are fully modified worlds    http://www.moddb.com/games/mount-blade-warband/mods/page/5   go to this link and you'll find that people are still making mods for this game and its staggering how many mods there are.  The game itself is great, vast amounts of content ( which a lot of blockbuster games are lacking), and if you play the mod worlds... look you'll just never stop playing ok.   The only problems i have with this game is that there is NO DUAL-WIELDING :( or i havent found it yet cuz i thought the weapon modes included dual wielding but they dont other than that enjoy the game 8/10 for regular game 20/10 with mods",1
"This game is ultimately trying and failing at what it does, but it isn't altogether horrible. I have a few + and - points below.  + I get somewhat of a Fallout vibe from this game - The art style is horrible. It is painstaking to look at. A first grader could have drawn these characters up. Splice in a little Fallout Raider garb that was run through a blender and you get this. + It is at least unique - The music is annoying. It wouldn't be if it fit the game at all. The music is completely different from what I expected given my atmosphere. Having the music off is more immersive. - The jokes and dialogue are cringy, due in part to the fact that the voice actors are cringy also - Combat is janky and boring.  - Stealth is incredibly basic and is ruined by the inclusion of the S.O.B. - The S.O.B. is an enemy that hunts you down if you spend too much time on a floor. It is a stupid idea that completely kills any hope for leisurely exploration and stealth. Seriously screw this crap, remove it! - This game has a poor set of options, especially where graphics are concerned. There is a poot selection of options and very few resolutions to choose from. I had to manually set my resolution to 1600x900 in the INI. There was only 1 other resolution that was 16:9! What a joke. It isn't especially well optimized either.  Ultimately this game is not very good. If you fixed all the things I griped about, then you would still have a mediocre game with maybe a few interesting moments.",-1
this games is an amazing millitary shooter i reccomend it to anyone still cant wait for DAYZ standalone  ,1
"Never have I ever played a game thats so relaxing and calm. While without headphones I began to get frustated at some of the puzzles, I place my earphones on and I'm in a eacefully state of mind.

"YES, YES , and more YES!  35 year old experienced gamer here, and after much speculation and fear that this would be another huge disappointment I can say that this is the DOOM sequel we've been waiting for!!! Modern FPS have walked away from many of the original reasons we fell in love with the genre. If you like old school shooters with some new flair and features this is it. I can finally put Brutal Doom down for a bit and play something more modernized! I think the beta had everyone worried but its just tacked on multiplayer, the singleplayer is the heart here. Lets home for some good single player DLC!!  9.5/10 would get yelled at by my wife for staying up too late again!",1

"Perhaps the price was not just, but as it is DoK offers a surprisingly good campaign akin to that of its predecessors. with much of the same trappings. The base gameplay is decent, the sound and artstyle are amazing and although many find flaw with the desert only terrain, I like it.  The only true flaws I can find are the definite lack of maps, slightly not so good AI and the curious balance choices (Coalition is amazingly overpowered). Definitely recommended.",1

"An Indie game that recieved a huge boost from the Kickstart community. Great mix of RTS and TBS elements in a sci-fi setting. There's huge depth to this game, but playing can get frustrating down to the games' random side.   This game is atmospheric with a great soundtrack and SFX.   My only regrets is that the game isn't longer - but as getting new playable ships is very challenging this game can keep you coming back for more.  For £7 its a fantastic game!",1
I expected this game to be nothing more than Roblox. However this game is full of fun gameplay and is very fun with friends.,1
"People willl say this game is sucessor of Ragnarok.  Don't think that, think of it more as the Developers used Ragnarok as a template to build from. The game is great, very grindy, but with the grind you will make friends. The classes are intresting and make you want to build alts to try out diffrent combinations.   All in all its a good game with some sharp edges that need to be grinded and smoothed down.",1
Good job Developers. Keep the good work.,1
Story is more than enough to buy this game.Hopefully COD will make more games like this one.,1
Great game but pay to win...,-1

"A fun train simulation game where you compete against other railroad companies in a race to connect the most cities with each other and the resources they need in order to grow while turning a profit for yourself. If you enjoy competitive tycoon gaming then you'll love this game. While it does have a multiplayer mode no one actually bothers anymore, so don't expect to get to play against humans. Trust me though the computers can give you a run for your money. You can normally pick this game up for around 5 dollars and I've personally wasted over 50 hours on it probably so well worth it in my opinion.",1

It is a bad motherfu-cker.,1
I don't know if you can take this game very seriously. Obviously the graphics are nothing to be taken seriously. In my opinon this is a fun little game to play when your bored that just happens to have some depth to it.,1
i bloody love it - addictive and fun,1
"I generally hate RPG's like torchlight and diablo series, but the fact that you can mod it to your whim and have control over alot of thing in character creation and pet selection to loot drops and gameplay impact is what i like. For example i like a thousand enemies in my screen so will get a mod that does exactly that and make it more enjoyable its pretty ridiulous once you intall mods. The game itself however can be repetative and boring and just bleh. But loot and other fun features make it bearable 7/10 (with the fact that you can mod it).",1
"I may be mad late to this party, but I just got around to playing Dark Souls. All memes aside, this game is very hard at times; however, it is actually an incredibly well balanced game. The level design is brilliant from both an aesthetic and design perspective, and the enemy placement is probably the most well thought out of any game I've ever played. This game gives you no map whatsoever and a large world where all the areas are interconnected yet I never had any trouble getting around.  The combat requires precision and strategy rather than button mashing (although this often means circle strafing until you can backstab an enemy). Different character builds also offer significantly different gameplay experiences, while at the same time making almost every build viable.  The online interactions are pretty great too. I am not the kind of person who likes online multiplayer at all usually, I hate competition and I get nervous interacting with people even online. That said I think Dark Souls has great co-op and PvP options. For one you can play through the game without having to bother, and when you do want to bother you really get to shape your online experience. One thing that I initially found offputting was the idea that you could be invaded by other players at (almost) any time, then it actually happened to me. I was in an early level fighting a mini boss when someone invaded, When they saw that I was fighting another enemy they just stood there and watched me fight while debuffing me to make it harder. When I attacked them and they saw just how weak I was they just shrugged. Some people might find this kind of thing frustrating but I found myself laughing during the whole debacle. Honestly you will die so often in this game that PvP deaths and PvE deaths will not feel very different from each other. Finally I should mention the story. You could easily play through this game without even knowing there is one or whatyou are doing. Dark Souls puts you in the shoes of the chosen undead tells you to go do some tasks and doesn't tell you why until about a third of the way in. The world is full of details, characters, and events that you will only hear about in passing or read about in an item description. The story is not about your characters actions as much as it is about the events that lead up to your characters actions, and you can either give a ♥♥♥♥ or not. Dark Souls is a game that puts a lot of agency about how the game is played into the hands of the player, and as a result it feels really good to git gud at it.  This game is amazing and everyone should play it 10/10",1
"You're still better off with Diablo II, but it's OK. Touch boring, story-wise.",-1

"Good game. Simple FPS in the grand, Nazi-killing tradition of all the Wolfenstein games. Graphics and effects are great. Story is good. Pace is good. Guns are fun.

"This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, while its sequel ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.",1
"Positives: Incredibly imaginative platformer with a brilliant and fun concept. A classic.  Negatives: The concept is pretty much all this game has going for it; that alone is enough to make this a must-play game, but some of the puzzles are ridiculous and have nothing to do with the concept. There simply isn't any depth of character or world-building to this game, so there's no point in getting invested in the silly puzzles.  Overall: You have to play this game. But don't waste your time 100%-ing it.",1
"This series is one of the most expansive turn-based games I've ever played. Not only does it have essentially no level caps, but practically every action you do in the game results in some kind of progression. Similarly, there are SO many different surprises that this game has to it.    Leveled up a character class (or combination of classes)? Unlock a better variety of it.    Cast a spell? It levels up.    Cast a spell next to the character who created them? You can now learn how to cast that spell on that character.    Wanted to level up a favorite item? Use the item world and that ITEM levels up.    Bought weapons/armors/items in the store? Your customer rank goes up.   Essentially one of the most expansive and surprisingly enjoyable games I've played over the past 15+ years.",1

"Really fun game. Like the idea that you can pick the songs that you want to use and change the skins via workshop and don't have to buy them! Getting the hang of it took me a couple of games and then I was finally able to play it without thought. Worth the money I spent it on - definitely not a waste of disc space. It's a little rage inducing for me, though...   P.S. This is also a really good reflex warmup prior to playing CS:GO or any shooter game that includes aim and reflex.",1
"A beautiful game - nice scenery, characters and story - but unfortunately this game is way too short and simple.   I liked the first one (The Whispered World) for it's classic adventure point and click style with lots of hard puzzles. This game is clearly more for the kids. You have no inventory and all the puzzles are easily solved since you don't have many options other than just clicking with your mouse.    The bad points:     Way too short - this is 30€ for a game you can complete in 4 hours.    You can't skip cutscenes. At first it's okay but unfortunately you find that if you watch a 3-5 min cutscenes and quit the game, the next time you return you have to see the whole cutscene again - because the game's checkpoint was BEFORE the cutscene. What the deuce?    No puzzles that takes longer than 30 seconds to solve. You have no inventory, meaning you can click everywhere and the game does everything for you. I guess it's fine for some but for an old 'point and click'-dude like me it kinda sucks :)    Loading screens! What is this? We are talking loading screens between simple scenes meaning that if you go'll between two screens to solve puzzles you will have to wait for the loading screen EVERY TIME! Not even the old adventure games from early 90's have this.    The good points:     Beautiful world! Big up for the art team.    Great story - it makes a lot more sense if you've played the first one. The story is too short though (if you want to play Whispered World PLEASE don't start this game. They spoil the story in the beginning).   Overall I guess I'm a bit disappointed because I enjoyed the game but somehow feel a bit cheated for its short story. It seriously had the potential to have the coolest story ever!  If I were you I'd wait for a 50% sale.",-1
this is so unbelievable awesome game ever!,1
"The menu is hard to navigate, the game is pay to win, and 2007 graphics but it still updates.",-1
Fun but frustrating once you get past the first few levels. Gets to be tedious after awhile. Do not play if you don't have expert control of a mouse.,1
"There's no option to say it's ok, it's either yes or no, but that's about the best thing you can say about this game. This game's not bad but it's also not very good, it's just something to play. I guess if you're a huge LOTR fan you'll like it more but I'm only a casual fan of the series, I own the movies on Blu-Ray and that's about it.",-1
"Ok, this is more like it. The patch took care of pretty much all the issues I had with the initial release. Shadows look great on higher resolution, AA looks great, and it's nice to finally be able to play the game in 1080 without having to resort to a mod (which I thank you for once again, Durante). The only issue I have now is a slightly inconsistent framerate. It's a relatively solid 60fps during cutscenes, but as soon as gameplay kicks in, it drops to 30. It's sort of annoying, considering I can run more demanding games at 60fps consistently without much issue, but it by no means renders the game unplayable. The game at least looks much better than the console versions now.  Mulling it all over, I don't mind giving this game a recommendation now. While I still think it's ridiculous that these options weren't included at launch, I definitely appreciate the folks at Square Enix listening to the fans (even the nastier ones), and stepping up to fix the issues. I'm actually kind of looking forward to playing the Steam version of Lightning Returns now.",1
"It's not the longest game ever, but it's beautiful, emotionally, and graphic wise. The art style is amazing, and the graphics are on par with todays game, due to the way they were designed alone. The gameplay is intense, and has you always preparing for whatever could be around the corner. The thing I love about bioshock, especially this one, it just feels so emotional, its hard to describe why, but it is, and its one of the best damn games ive ever played.",1
"Mount&amp;Blade is that game you didn't know you've always been craving.   It's like you're a unit in someone else's strategy campaign who suddenly gained sentience and went rogue, hiring men for your own warband so you can ride around the worldmap robbing caravans, until you're strong enough to crush armies and fight siege battles.   And the total conversion mods are great. There's one for every major region or conflict in history. Every steam user should have this game.",1
"Flawless slasher mechanics plus RPG elements, in manga/anime-styled graphics (that are as beautiful as baby Jesus) and amazing sound (music + VA)? Sounds like a perfect game. Made by one man in addition. 11/10 must buy.",1

"People complain about this game, I like it better than Far Cry 2. I was attacked by a tiger, so I ran away. Right through an enemy outpost, within about 3 seconds I was getting shot at, but I hear an enemy shout 'HOLY ♥♥♥♥ A TIGER' Then 30 seconds after that the gun fire ceased, and the outpost was mine. I didnt fire a shot. Best outpost raid EVER!   Ability to use a Tiger by accident! 10/10",1
"I highly enjoy this game, I love hopping into a realistic match with my friends and just having some fun. But, This game just becomes a grind after a while if you don't want to spend money on the game. Also the developers have no idea what they are doing. But if you are ok with this and just want to have fun, by all means download this game.",-1

"Sucks that it's only multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, I like playing other players, but sometimes you just want to chill out and practice on a dummy (A.I.) Good game, but not for me. Banner Saga was omgwtfawesome but this spin off isn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.",1
"Perhaps part of the problem is the fact that I'm not innately familiar with the character, but despite my usual affinity for surreal and/or silly games this one just didn't do it for me. It's about as simple as you could ask for, play-wise - you can only run and jump, and that's all you need to do to grab a floating key on each screen and move on to the next one. There are various enemies and obstacles in your way, of course, but despite their varied nature they exist to frustrate you above all else: it's frequently difficult to tell which onscreen elements will hurt you at a glance, and unclear which background pieces you can jump on until you take a leap of faith. You can take a fair number of hits before dying, but you only get one life and energy refills are scarce, so expect frequent trips back to the very beginning as you execute the necessary trial-and-error banging of one's head against a wall until you figure the nastier parts out.  I can appreciate the game's efforts to recall the 8-bit days in terms of both presentation and challenge (and its cheap asking price too), but losing precious life points due to design uncertainty and nickel-and-diming hit detection over and over again just doesn't make me eager to see this one through to the end. I certainly can't say I lost a huge amount of time or money on Tcheco, but I also can't say I enjoyed what I did experience of it, and thus can't recommend it to others either.",-1

"A well done puzzle platformer. One of the more intriguing elements in the game is that they incorporate the philosophy of mind in the story. They use Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers as the protagonists for their respective positions (merely referred to by their last names in-game). Dennett does not believe in consciousness (soul in the game) and Chalmers is an advocate for consciousness (soul). Although the pro/con soul/consciousness debate is largely lacking the kind of robustness seen even in an elementary exposition of their positions in philosophical writing, it does a fair enough job to be provocative even for the veteran of philosophy. Additionally, experiencing it in an already mind-flexing puzzle game is icing on the cake. Therefore I don't dock them points for oversimplfying the philosophicals issues touched upon in the game. Even without the philosophical debate, the puzzles are enough to warrant the play through.",1
"Relaxing puzzling with beautiful Japanese images, Shishi-odoshi and koi to give a complete Zen experience.",1
"This is a good game. It is a adventure (not exactly the old point and click) in a 3d environment. It presents a great story (so far I have played 3 of5 episodes) and follows the events of the last game however I do think that the gameplay itself could be better.  Graphics 7.5/10 - Do not get me wrong, these are very good graphics however they are not truly optimized. In a 270x even if it does not stay at 99% usage, I have to disable anti-aliasing to get over 30 fps. Using far higher settings I can get 45-50 fps in Mordor with the same hardware. There are also strange lighting effects with weird results. If the graphics in this game were optimized, I would have given it one more point.  Sound 8.5/10 - The music is good and there are voiceover gems . Shitbot is hillarious.  Story 10/10 - I love the story and its intrigue. Lots of unexplained misteries. True choices and consequences (better than telltale).   Gameplay 7/10 - Although I love the story, sometimes I wonder why the developers opted to construct the gameplay the way they did. It feels awkard sometimes. Some tasks are just random and almost no clue is given. Navigating on the open world is tedious and there is a lot of backtracking. You do not carry a map, which is only available in selected places.  Overall 8.5/10 - If you enjoy adventures, liked the The Longest Journey, or like a great mistery story, I recommend this game to you. It is a very good game indeed. A few of the design choices are awkard however they do not take away the charm the story offers. ",1

cool game that has a refreshing story,1
It awesome.,1

Fun up until the final boss fight which is essentially break a girl toy and kick her ball of a cliff. and the final boss fight's core mechanic relies on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics engine so half the time the ball gets stuck on a desk and since you can jump you have to restart the entire ♥♥♥♥ing boss fight. other than that and the fact that this game feel more like a campaign for wizard wars this game was quite fun,1
GTA III Shooter Survival Guide  GTA III &amp; Vice City are a pain in the @$$ to shoot or even kill the enemies. So i've come with tips to help your @$$ steamroll your enemies. If you're using the controller mod this is directed towards you. If you're $#!t with the keyboard and mouse...... just give up on computer gaming it's not for you...  1. Never get into a fight without having Body Armor!  Body Armor is not really avaliable at the start so if you're getting shot at you better book it. 2. Never get into to a gun fight without blocking yourself off with a car first.  The A.I. will stop shooting at you if you're behind a car. So that will save you 90% of the time until the car blows up! 3. Never attempt to snipe at close range!  You will get that @$$ hammered.................. so just don't.....pls. 4. Shooting enemies close range will also get yourself hammered  Those A.I. will load clips in that @$$ so quick....... 5. DRIVE LIKE YOUR CAR IS YOUR FIRST BORN CHILD!!!!!!!!!!  by midgame you're at war with like everyone.... If your car catches fire you will have to deal with close range enemies referring to #4 that's a really bad idea...  Well i've tought you all i know young one now go out there and survive!?,1

"I still enjoy playing this game years after it came out, due to the incredibly engaging and mind-bending puzzles and narrative. I daresay this might be the best game I've ever played, not to mention that the included co-op series essentially makes it two games in one. A must-have for everyone who has ever touched a keyboard or console controller in their lifetime.",1

"Great MMORPG, and you can play it without spending a single cent (which I'd recommend doing, since according to all these other reviews they'll permaban you if you don't keep spending).",1
"Quite a fun game, multiple characters to play. Highly customizable. Some levels can be hard if you don't grind, but I had to grind minimal.",1
this is the best simulation game ever its totally awesome ,1
"FEZ is not PEZ, but it's FUNKY (F is For Fez)! Seriously, play it. :)",1
Way better than the new one.,1
I may have only played an hour and a half of this game so far but I am really enjoying it. I'm chuckling heaps :). I'd probably take this game in small doses as the constant battles got a bit monotonous for me near the end of an hour. I've had no problem with the game and my laptop's pretty slow and handles it just fine which is awesome. It's also a pretty game.,1
Finally a well-designed co-op game &amp; not the usual player-one &amp; player one´s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ companion.,1
"this is not a game  you just got back to your family's home from a trip, and it seems that your sister run away with her girlfriend (yep, your sister is a lesbian) and walk around the house to read some notes from your sister about her feelings and that's pretty much it.",-1

Project Cars is the ultimate driving simluator.",1
I would rate it as the best game ever (Y),1
"More characters,more items,more bosses(who,sometimes make you restart your run) and lots of triket worms(they are everywhere and I hate 'em all).I love how this game is running at 60FPS but I miss the old lag which was so useful.They made the easy bosses,machine guns that fires tons of tears which make me feel like I have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥,especially when I'm on low HP. 10/10-I will lose my social life",1

"A unique RPG. Think of this like Half Minute Hero, you are able to try past chapters to earn better scores and do sidequests but without the 30 second gimmicks.  Pros: + Made using RPG Maker MV + You're able to replay past chapters. + Sidequests + Unique Hero Call ability + Unique Plot, the setting for this entire game is What If 'Heroes Lost' + Dev is actively fixing bugs.  Cons: - Pressing TAB freezes the game. - Sometimes slowdown occurs unexpectedly, even while on Battle Results screen. - There might be several bugs, picking up the fourth cloak in the first chapter crashes the game.  For the low price, it's money well spent.",1
Tech support for Linux is weak at this point. My computer plays Civ V with no issues yet CivBE terrain and units appear black and the game is unplayable because of it. At this point I can't recommend the game because it seems rushed in certin many respects.,-1
really thrilling  finally finished with two characters die requires a lot of consideration to survive  nice game,1
its the first pc online first person shooter and its the best :),1
"Gameplay is really excellent. The story and especially the cutscenes are a bit lacking, but the game features excellent graphics, a pretty stable/bugless experience, and up to 7.1 surround. Great sci-fi shooter.",1

"The game is absolutely addicting in its simplicity. The game is very easy and simple to get into, but it has an extremely high skill ceiling. The games are short and have you craving for more after each win (or loss). Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1

"Solid alternative to SimCity, especially after the latest direction of the series. Fun management, great mod support, and the developers keep on adding new content to keep the game fresh. If you love city-builders, you'll love Cities: Skylines.",1
A BRILIANT GAME. the controles are abit complex and hard 4 biginers. once you get femiliar with the controles(in about a day). please give more time 4 the cyber driver cuz i keep on screwing up.,1

A dissapointment compared to the trilogy of HeroRise tbh,-1
"For a game that's 15 years old, it still holds up. The story has a fairly silly premise, but is executed fairly well, and is fully voice-acted. David Bowie's cameos are fantastic, but the concerts will drag if you're not into his stuff. Even when he's not involved, the music is still fairly well composed. The controls haven't aged poorly, and the only complaint is that it's built for a gamepad, however, the controls are rebindable, so that's not a big deal. The shooting segments are somewhat awkward, but it may just be personal experience, since I haven't played the game for over 10 years. Puzzles are sometimes cryptic, but the solution generally presents itself in some format, as long as the player's been diligent about picking up EVERYTHING. The lip-sync gets pretty laughable, but it's impressive for a game this old, considering it animates the entire face.  The open world is interesting to explore, though it can get a bit tedious since there isn't much to do outside the main story. Variation between the multiple characters is great, and players can always find someone who is fully capable, or at the very least, looks like a badass.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves classic adventure games or David Bowie.",1
It's like a demo version of L4D with retaraded zombies and combat system. Needs many changes to be a good game.,1
"A fun, comical, charming game of skill, prediction and chance.   Guide Polandball to space, avoid other hassling countries and try not to be held back by the gravity of larger nations such as Russia, China and Canada.  Collect fuel to reach your dreams in the sky, eat burgers to keep your health up, and collect money so you can stop using kitchenware as a rocket.  Its not all struggle though, occationally netherland ball or sometimes a jamaica ball will help you get higher... in various ways.  For $3 or less its pretty well worth it. You will get more satisfaction out of this than you will the bag of chips you would otherwise buy.",1

"Everything one could ask for from Deus Ex. The atmosphere, the environment, it all weaves together into a complex fabric that really immerses the player into the world. Any perceived flaws with the story disappears into the background as one dives into the game. Meticulous detail makes you feel like you're there, a part of the narrative. That is the one thing that matters above all -- the feeling that you are in the world of Deus Ex.",1
A short little indie game with an awesome story. You guys should try it when you have the extra cash. :),1
To any fans of Real Time Strategy (RTS) games:  You will love this game. Enough Said.,1
"This game has the dubious honour of beating out many terribly ported games to be one of the worst ports I've ever played. However, it also possesses the far less dubious honour of being one of the finest RTS games ever designed, whose original version sadly no longer works on modern versions of windows. It's on sale semi-regularly, so i'd advocate picking it up then.",1
"I have a pretty good PC actually and this game is running like a potato that doesnt have any legs. so guess what. Not so good.   I have an Nvidia 750 Ti and I definetely expected more from this game. but obviously it was a complete waste of Money. My PC can handle games like battlefield 4 in ultra, but not this game on Medium-Low.  I honestly recommend you buy this game for PS4 or XBOX ONE  rip #pcmustardrace?Ithinknot",-1
Decent enough game. Great story.,1
"This game is a near-perfect homage to the wonderful decade that was the 80's. It has all the fun gameplay of Far Cry 3, but it improves everything with an endless supply of one-liners, cheesy action music, explosions and radioactive dinosaurs that shoot lasers from their eyes. Get. This. Game.",1
"So far from what I've played, the visual look absolutly stunning, with nice shiny balls and tables, and the area around with the sounds look and sounds nice, and it's so good i actually feel like im in a high class club playing pool. Now actually going into gameplay, compared to Pool Nation, it's different in the way you control it where they made the mouse visible now and you control most of the game by clicking-n-holding and draging, I would have prefered PN's controls but in Pure Pool it feels more heavy and precise. Haven't tried out the multiplayer yet because of server issues, but I would pressume it would be the same normal fun that's had in Pool nation. The ball phyics in it is an overal improvement from the previous title, aside from hiting the white ball with (as hard/fast as you can) feels a little bit off, i want to say not realistic in way i guess. But overall it's a nice improvement over the old pool game and would recomened it at the price, with hopefully a few more updates and tweaks to the game, Pure Pool will/is the best pool game out there.  Playing more of the game, i found out that the unrealistic physics the game has is the result of bugged Keyboard and mouse controls, this stoped being an issue as soon as i plugged in a controler. The only portion of the game is fixed, but it's annoying to get a match going where you will see a list of online players and have to send them a challenge to play with them, but you don't know if they want to play with you or responed, so you would sit there waiting and waiting. I don't know why they would just make a 'find a match' option and would put players together as soon as possible to play together online. Plus the PC controls are clunky.  so as of this moment in time, i would suggest waiting a month or two before getting the game, and let them tweak, fix, and update the game to make it less buggy, more controller optimized, and hopefully add a lobby system. Or just get the PS4 version and not the PC version if you want it now.  More info  here  [www.ksalue.com] ",1
As you can see. Right below me there is not one bad review This is very much saying something about this thing that they call a game this is not a game it is what every company should trying to make a sandbox rpg out of. This game goes on as a model that is in every part amazing and sexy. (But the graphics might make you ♥♥♥♥ your pants and not in the good way either),1
"Ohhh look another Korean - Japanese - Chinese MMORPG with tons of microtransactions, repetitive grinding, boring as a penguin in a garage",-1
Great story line.,1
  NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WINDOWS 10 USER    Because it doesn't work well you have to use compatibilty to Windows 7 mode and when you use that steam client woudn't count your played time,-1
"This game is really fun! It is really addicting. Also if your new to the black ops series, it might take some time to getting used to and becoming a pro. Theres a lot of weapons and guns to choose from and the maps are amazing and very detailed. If you like first-person shooters and science-fiction games, then this is a must. Just make sure your computer is beefy enough or else it will crash or become really laggy.",1
"After investing almost 300 hours, I just want to say that I'd gladly do it all again.",1
"Too hard too soon.  Edit: I notice the above statement gave someone a chuckle, but I shall elaborate - Basically, I got to the third level before some frustrating elements were introduced, most notably the nail in the cliff wall. I can understand making the game challenging, but three levels in!? That's ridiculous. It looks nice and colourful with cute characters. But the difficulty is unforgivable.",-1
"I highly recomend this game, the gameplay and the graphics are awesome. The story line is awesome til the end but if you have the expansion pack, it makes it quite a bit better. This game is not very scary, but is fun and thrilling. I would strongly recomend this game if you like to play games that deal with light fighting with dark, and if you play TPS (Third Person Shooter) games.",1
"(06/10) - Good  I really want to recommend this game, which i would noramlly do with a rating of 6, but i can´t. I can´t recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more. Don´t get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches it´s limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible. And what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to it´s mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.  So what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module. Having to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.  Now maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it: You appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it. You will have fun and enjoy the game but if you´re looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...  PS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it. PSS: If you´re looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if you´re a non beginner). Just message me that you´re interested and we work out the details. This offer only counts for Java.",-1
this game is so much fun! ,1
"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.  One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.  As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.  There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.  As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.  Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.  That is what this game is about.",1
Left 4 Dead 2 is on of the best of zombie survival game has ever made. Play it with your friends (if you got some) for the best experience.  Why i have to play it with my (Imaginary) friends? Because the community is kinda toxic.  'My official instruction? KILL ALL THE SON OF ♥♥♥♥♥ES!',1
Still maybe the most original puzzle game I've yet to play.,1
Horrible graphics + Zombies + Ak47 = Masterpiece!,1
  One of the best pieces of media that I have ever consumed.,1
This game was a big let down. A step down from civ 5. Seems like these guys just wanted our money this time :/,-1
A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends  update; i played 210+ hours and still love it so much i'm going to marry it and have terraria babys :D  One day i went outside and i started to burn like day light is killing me. .ouch! that hurts time to go back to my room so i can play more of this game and where my bat friends are waiting in my pure dark room filled with bat poop.,1
it is good game,1
Extremely in-depth and Fun to mess around with friends on FFA Servers. 10/10,1
Everything that you could think about a JRPG style...  ...was deconstructed in this game.  And It was one of my best experiences in all my life as a gamer.  You should try ;),1
"An interesting platform-game, which I recommend to everyone who likes old-fashioned graphics and splatter! I did play Bloodrayne 3D some years ago and this one caught my attention, when I was looking to buy platform games.  + 'old-fashioned' Graphics + classic Platform-game + Gameplay + many finishing moves + Splatter!  - Sound FX (not the best quality) - Controls (some moves are very hard to accomplish) ",1
"The controller eerr controls were a bit akward but aside from that, this is a great game. I can't wait to see where it goes. the characters are amazing and the setting is terrifying in a deceptively unsettling way. The cliff hanger ending is stressful. I love it.",1
"10/10 - Bottom line its free to play, and worth a download. Warframe is one of the best games I've played in awhile. Game is constantly getting new content to keep players loving it. Its artstyle, graphics, and combat system are keeping up with the times. Community isn't bad and Dev's constantly take feedback from players.",1
"Game is crazy fun. I love how one secret can lead to multiple others. 9/10. Would be 10/10 but crashed on me once and failed to load a cutscene the other, also I believe you cannot adjust the ADS sensitivity which is suuppper slow.",1
"I enjoyed the stroy this VN told. It gave an interesting plot of an alternate world with and without Mana following a princess and her freind. I recomend this game to anyone who:  First, enjoy VNs Second, enjoy a slow paced game without much action  All in all a great game and I can't wait for Milestone 2 to come out!",1
"You play as a guy named JASON! Who falls out of a plane onto an island and you meet a creepy black dude, who gives you a tatoo, and says it's magic and forces you to kill some piggies and takee over a base to save some guy.

"   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry6p7ywkpYw   I didn't like my experience with 10 Second Ninja X, just being honest and sitting through it it does have some problems.   First of which I think is the over use of death objects to acheive a unrealistically high difficulty without any creative level design.   Secondly I think movement is a bit quirky especially vertically which is slow in a game all about going fast, and sometimes messes with expectations of location when using a shuriken, sometimes messing up a otherwise perfect run.  Another was more of a annoyance, vareity this game sorely lacks it. Literally all objects are instant death and theres only two off the top of my head ways to die, electricution and crushing. Compare that to super mario brothers, on the NES where you can fall into bottomless holes, get hit by enemies, burned by pirahna plants, eaten, etc. All im saying is that though the game itself has 6 differently themed backdrops, they're nothing but backdrops.  Something else I have a problem with is the forced story and the odd places it goes for an indie game. First off there's a small break every time you finish a set of stages, this im okay with for a small break of monotiny. But what it does after that, purposefully annoy the player with a worthless character, and its not like you hate the guy, hes a minor inconvinience, get past him and done, do the stage. But its what happens later, you know expecting it to go AGAIN with this boring sequence where he dies yada yada. And then you know what happens? GUY COMMITS SUICIDE. THIS GAME HAS A CHARACTER THAT COMMITS SUICIDE, LIKE WTF? Everything else is happy go lucky any channel would play this for a younger audience, and you threw it out with that one scene. HONESTLY WHO APPROVED THAT? You honestly might have lost major word of mouth because of that.  And finally its the oddly surgent difficulty, as I mentioned earlier this game has a problem with overuse of death objects. This is mostly present in the first set of stages, then it gets WAY EASIER. Honeslty I expected a challenging game and then I got bored just playing on to see that challenge I once even didnt even have to complete the last two stages of a set because I was perfect on the last few before them. And then the last stages return to the difficulty level of the first except they seem really well designed in comparison. If they had more of that earlier in with a little bit of filler maybe I would have liked this game a lot more. But instead they had to be the new super meat boy and have just have electric death everywhere. Honestly why doesnt the ninja just wear a rubber suit? Its not the most comfortable thing ever BUT HEY YOU DONT DIE TO THE THING THATS EVERYWHERE. Its like being a fish without guills you go under water for a bit come up to the surface for a long time and then dip your head into the water to see how things have changed.   Graphically Im not too bad on the graphics, some of the earlier stages are definately dull looking. And the music is okay if not lacking in vareity, if im in a casino level I'd assume there'd be a change to a more casino vibe then the stuff that's been playing since the start of the game.   I personally think that this game has nothing to differentiate itself enough from the crowd, especially from the last game to justify a purchace, unless you're a masochist, and then you should just skip the middle bits so you dont sleep on the job, and enjoy the superior design of perhaps the last games levels? Yeah those levels I feel have a better design and now that they're revamped Its a good way to play them, even as a non fan of the original I dig the level design more than this game's over reliance on killing you over giving you a challenging level that needs mastery of a key mechanic to get a fast enough time to proceed.  TL:DR A overly typical second entry to a bland platforming game that doesn't add anything over the original core mechanics wise, or give anything a unique feel. I feel for the pr team on this.",-1
"Relevant specs: FX-8320 R9 290 8GB DDR3 1600 Windows 10 360 controller  Port review: I haven't tried KB+M, because the design makes more sense to play with a controller in my opinion. Otherwise I've had no problems with the game. Steady frame rate with no noticeable drops using highest AA (rendering at 4k), no issues with video or sound playback. I'm very happy they gave us the option to set AA levels, and especially to turn off motion blur and DoF. being a port from a handheld I'm surprised at how good the game looks. Overall it's definitely a very nice port, I believe this is the most effort I've seen in porting a console JRPG to PC. I hesitated a few days before purchasing due to all the negative reviews... but Steam reviews of ports are beginning to be completely worthless. A port can take a lot of time and care and give a lot of good options, but some insist on complaining no matter how much they get because there's always something that could be better. That's life. They didn't redesign the game from the ground up for the PC, they ported it. They did a good job of it, and I'm glad to have it.  ",1
"Like the first game but with more levels, flavour, characters, fun, death, lore, background, and story. If you liked the first one, then this one is also for you.",1
"I have just recently beat the game and have seen the ending, which is less than what everyone was hoping, the boss fight and the end cutscene.... That being said, the game up till that point was great and beating every boss was satisfying to the core. For my playthrough I used the mouse and keyboard, which to be honest is not even that bad, everyone complaining about the pc controls either only uses the keyboard, or just doesn't have the mental capacity to learn them. For everyone who has the mental capacity greater than a teaspoon, and the patience of a master........ this game is for you. 10/10 would die again :D",1
Amazing game! 10/10 would recommend to anyone,1
"At first I felt like it's an experiment in leveraging word of mouth to sell an abstract meaningless creation by telling people it's deep and meaningful and watching them repeat that nonsense just so that they themselves do not seem shallow.  But in the end it's not just that. It's an exercise in solving problems you do not have for the narrator you do not care about by making forced choices that do not matter whenever told to fo so by the narrator. There's no gameplay, no meaningful win condition and, in the end, no aesop to be made.  The creator should have taken some effort to make the player care about the narrator or the narrator's obsession or, at least, to explain why the 'games' make any sense from a sane person's point of view and, thus, should be played by the actual customer.  P.S.: Now that I think of it, the game takes less than 2 hours to complete and, technically, can be refunded upon completion. Not refunding it would be an act of paying up for your own mistake of buying it on faith.",-1
1. You can play online with your friend 2. This game is very funny,1
"Great looking game, story is better than any GTA game i've ever played. The hand to hand combat is one of the best things about this game.",1
what a crock of SH*T,-1
"When i played this game. I had the same feeling as Skyrim. Playing for countless hours nonstop while having alot of fun while doing so. This is a generic 'turn-based' game, nor is it a game where you can just run in and expect to kill everything.   The game is sort of unique with its combat. It can be played as if it is a turn-based game, it can also be played as if its not. The main thing that seperates this game from others is difficulty. You might (and probably will) get stuck on a certain enemy at some point in the game. That just means you need to change your tactics or go level up or change your party. Once you do beat that...one enemy... that one group... it feels good. Much like the retro games like Contra, although not NEAR as hard. (then again depending on your difficulty...)  This game is amazing, its a topnotch game.    11/10.",1

"  Table of Contents: - Foreword - Graphics - Gameplay - Sounds - Controls - Quality - Overall Experience   -Foreword I thought that game was going to be great. I really had high expectations, which i rarely do. Well, i got dissapointet. A lot. Not even the music is good.   -Graphics I disliked the artstyle the game has, the graphics and all that just were weird. I do like Terraria-Styled graphics, but that wasnt even near Terraria  -Gameplay The gameplay ... Its just a rogue-like game which has not got any special items or anything. The only game i know which is similar to this, just a lot better is 'Magicite'. This game is something completly different, still reminds me of it somehow. The game has a random world generation which is pretty buggy. Sometimes you cant beat the level because the door is placed weirdly, sometimes you cant start, sometimes you get stuck because a bomb exploded. Its just bad. The box and NPC hitboxes are insanely weird. Sometimes NPC's hit me without even being on the same height-level (i dont know how to explain it, but it doesnt make sense and is just weird) The game felt really really boring. I had a lot more fun playing other Rogue-like games so its not that.  -Sounds When you swing your axe (even if in air, not hitting anything) it makes a really weird 'wood-hitting' sound. The music is not even decent. Its just being annoying over time.  -Controls The controls are also pretty weird. You use A,S,D,E and the arrow keys to move and shoot/hit. I really disliked them, there are options to change them though.  -Quality The overall quality is pretty bad. The world generations sucks, you get stuck insanely easily and sometimes cant even start without having to restart the level. It feels like the developers didnt put that much effort into some stuff, the hitboxed are weird, the game just feels unready right now.  -Overall Experience I didnt enjoy the game at all. Its insanely boring and kinda buggy. There are many other games on Steam which are a lot better. A LOT. Really, just ... MUCH BETTER. I recieved the game for free, so i dont really mind the money. I wouldnt have wasted my money on that though.",-1
It's a great game if you like a challenge and it really makes you think of what your next move will me,1
"Welp This has been a long time coming. Here goes nothing.   Warframe. I will give it a simple 3 out of 5.   Now to rant about it.  Well Its really hard to find anything really enjoyable about warframe as of late, I have q lot of hours in to the game and have played it on and off sense it was in alpha. Those days I remember playing Volt on the same map set with Corpus and grineer using nearly the same map tials.   Sadly The games Gun play is pretty average, nothing really works outside its intent, everythings smooth enough but Sadly some high lever area's just need you to have your frame built better they your gun and I really dont enjoy that. They have been giving guns and frames new looks, the primes are what I mean, but its simple not a fix for the bad Scaling of armor the enemy factions get above 50. Now yes they can change the scaling but the meta changes with that and it only gets harder. SO how about this. Make One impossible to get but completly over powered gun, like a bolt actions single round per reload rifle, that does insain damage to Armored targets and have that weapons just be what it is. Anti tank. that weapons Can be used in high lever missions for one frame that owns it to use and have them hit the heavy hitting enemys first. limiting the OP gun as much as possible is what I ask for.   now I gave this a moddest number in rating because I still can hop on to Warframe and play it. unlike other games I have rated.   Do I think Others would like the game?  Sadly no. Its really A huge @ss gride to do anything to level, almost litterally telling you. 'Buy stuff with real money to get good.' And sadly I have done that. I gave DE A bit of my money I could have used to not become homeless, or feed myself and mother. but know what. I really regret my chooses In buying stuff for this game only because no matter what I got, Something better came out to replace it.   Oh and the community although toxic as hell and likes to spam porn oddly enough, They are an Ok bunch of nobs to play with.",-1
Broke my mouse playing this game,1
"A highly enjoyable and beautiful to behold indie first person adventure game. It is similar to Dear Esther and it is relatively a short game, but it has solid gameplay (it's not a walking simulator) and a few very clever and challenging puzzles.   It tells an interesting main story and a few side stories, that you'll have to discover as you explore the decrepit building switching between the real world and a nightmarish version of it. The music score which is included in the game's folder) is excellent and fits perfectly with the general mood of the game.   ",1
"Still one of the best FPS games, now a simple no-frills fragger, everyone is on the same level. There are no 'kill streaks', no unlockable weapons. Only your skill against your opponent's.  Essentially what an FPS game should be.",1

"If you liked Geometry Wars 2, then you are going to love the third installment even more. The arcade adventure mode has dozens of levels (50 I think?), each unique in its own way. Think of them as 50 new modes to spend hours and hours on. Seriously, some of these levels will just mess with your head and have you restarting over and over again. They are very challenging, and even the most hardcore arcade gamers will be impressed. You thought playing on a plane was hard? Try a sphere. Also, all of the modes (pacifism, king of the hill, etc) from geometry wars 2 are present. It has local co-op and online play.  I do, however, recommend a game-pad, even though the mouse controls are good.  Honestly, this game has it all. Worth at least $30. What a steal.",1
"This game is bad. Really bad. Bad clone of Hotline Miami, with translation from Russian into English made probably by google translator.   So why I recommend it? Because it's so bad, you really have to see it.",1

"Terraria is a 2D game where you explore,fight bosses,mine,build,craft,play with friends,PVP There is alot to do and over 800 items after 1,000 hours i can easily say i recommend this game if any of those things are what you want in a game",1
Still the best storyline.,1
"A Good Survivor / Horror type game It dos lack 'Horror' To a point (Heck Duke Nukem Forever has some scary parts like the Hive level and such) it is a great Survivor game. However the community / Multyplayer Aspect of this game is pretty dirty Poor (You'll have ppl rage at you just becouse you picked Ellis for example or whatknock) And do what I like to call Online Massive Ganging (Where alot of ppl group up with there friends to join a match and start yelling/cussing/being very immature racist/sexist remarks over whatever and you cant deal with it becouse there on the other team or they brought all there friends with them to vote No to such votes) Campain is nice and all but out of 10 points? This would be about a 6, The online multiplayer Games even without the 'Online Gangs' Isnt the best, but the Community is dirt Poor. Makes the Strip joint in Duke Nukem look more mature and suitible to children.",1

"Bethesda Softworks' release of Fallout 3 in 2008 went a long way in reviving a series which looked to have been milked for all it was worth, and brought a new set of fans for the series. Yet, while the new fans were being entertained by Fallout 3, some of the older fanbase – including myself – bemoaned the game for its poor story and dialogue, the liberties taken with the canon, and the disappointing ending. When the development of Fallout: New Vegas was announced, I must admit that I felt a bit of trepidation. Obsidian Entertaiment was composed of members of the Fallout development team when Black Isle was at its prime, but were they the right people to take up the mantle of a new Fallout game?  In the development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian drew in elements from the incomplete game which was to have been the third instalment of the main series, Van Buren, with various changes to their implementation to deal with the smaller geographical area. Gameplay-wise, though, Fallout: New Vegas strongly resembles Fallout 3, and could be best described as a refined variant of the first/third-person action role-playing action that distinguished Fallout 3 from its predecessors in the series. The skill set has been cleaned up somewhat, removing the Small Guns and Big Guns categories, and placing their weapons into the Guns and Explosives skills accordingly. The new Survival skill ties into the expanded crafting mechanics, and is of particular concern to the new Hardcore mode, in which the character must eat, sleep and drink, in which ammunition has weight as in the original Fallout games, and in which healing takes place over time, rather than being instantaneous.  In an increased attempt to make non-weapon skills useful, the crafting mechanic has been expanded to include the ability to hand-load ammunition using shell casings, powder and lead at a reloading bench, along with cooking and the production of poisons at a campfire. The reloading mechanic is particularly welcome, allowing for the recycling of excess stockpiled ammunition, as well as the casting of rare ammunition types, including certain enhanced ammunition exclusive to the reloading bench. Meanwhile, the cooking mechanic gives a new use to those boxes of Cram which seem to be littered around the wasteland, allowing a skilled player to produce food which can heal more effectively and, in Hardcore Mode, which satiates the character's hunger for longer.  Another new addition to the series is the “true ironsights” configurable option, which ties into a general tightening-up of the shooting mechanics. VATS has been weakened from Fallout 3, and in its place, the shooting mechanics feel somewhat more satisfying, at least at long range, where long rifles feel a bit more useful than they did in Fallout 3. Indeed, weapons under the Guns skill feel a lot more capable of getting one to the end of the game than in Fallout 3, and it is perfectly possible for somebody to focus on one weapon skill – apart from possibly Explosives - and to have few problems proceeding onwards.  The biggest way in which Fallout: New Vegas is distinct to its immediate predecessor is that it feels like a character- and dialogue-oriented game, rather than the exploration-oriented approach of Fallout 3. One of my biggest disappointments with Fallout 3 was its rather poor storyline, in which one felt railroaded into a set of actions, even when they didn't make logical sense for your character, and which worked to the detriment of the rest of the game. Fallout: New Vegas, on the other hand, allows for a greater amount of flexibility with the storyline, with four distinct paths for one to set on, a lot of choices to make in the wasteland, and far more logical consistency than Fallout 3. This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.  Another area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.  A welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.  Aesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.  Inon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.  As with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.  Unfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors. Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.  Nevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.",1

"The graphics, music and levels in this game are pretty good, but the gameplay and controls on the other hand...  You are not rewarded for trying to speed things up, one boost with modern sonic and you will end up in the water/lava/whatever is around the tiny platforms. The general controls are very 'slippery'. With retro sonic even you can't platform like you are supposed to and it's very annoying. With the wonky controls even pressing A twice will make you fling off way too far into the direction you weren't facing (with modern sonic). There's a lot of precise platforming required in this game and not being able to stop where you want to is very frustrating. The levels and bosses are easy and the only thing you will die from is falling in the water due to trying to go fast, pressing A when something to interact with just gets randomly deselected and you will end up in the water, and just not being able to change direction at all.  To make it even shorter I liked the retro sonic levels a bit because they resembled the old sonic games slightly, and that's where it stops being a game and starts being a terrible experience (mostly gameplay wise).",-1
"When I got to the menu I thought this was going to be an amazing experience after looking around and after trying out the first Disney scene with the snake, I thought I was gonna be spending ages in loads of VR environments watching realtime animations like it. But then I found out that the snake experience 'Trust In Me' was the only realtime rendered experience apart from the menu, and the rest were just awful 360 degree videos. I guess I can't say i'm too dissappointed seeing as it's a free app, however it was a little decieving having that one immersive VR realtime animation and seeing all the studios on the main menu, then going to the really uncomfortable flat-feeling videos where you can't move around at all.  Overall if it had more actual VR content and not just awful looking videos then it would be a lot better, but the time and money was wasted on the videos and stopped this from being a really good piece of software that I and many others would have even paid for.",-1

"The opening of The Pre-Sequel begins some time after Borderlands 2 and Episode 3 of Tales from the Borderlands, on the flying city of Sanctuary, where the three former Vault Hunters Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai interrogate Athena after having captured her earlier. Athena then recounts her story, starting after the death of General Knoxx, when she received an offer to go find the Vault from a Hyperion programmer named Jack. She then joins fellow Vault Hunters: Nisha, Wilhelm, and Claptrap, on a spaceship headed for the Hyperion moon base, Helios. On the way, they are ambushed by the Lost Legion, an army of Dahl soldiers led by Colonel Tungsteena Zarpedon, and crash-land onto the moon base. After meeting up with Jack, they attempt to use Helios's defense system, but realizes there is a jamming signal coming from Elpis, Pandora's moon. They attempt to escape, but they are stopped by Zarpedon, and a mysterious alien-like warrior. Jack then sends the Vault Hunters to Elpis on a moonshot rocket.  After landing on Elpis, the Vault Hunters are helped by Janey Springs, a junk dealer, who guides them to the spaceport known as Concordia. Here, the Hunters, under Jack's orders, request help from Moxxi to find the jamming signal. After raiding a former Dahl station, they find out that the signal was put up by the Meriff, the person in charge of Concordia, as well as Jack's former underling. While this is happening, Zarpedon also activates Helios' weapon system, the Eye which fires powerful lasers on the surface of Elpis. The Meriff is later killed by Jack at his office due to a failed attempt to kill Jack from behind. With Concordia secured, Jack and Moxxi guide the Vault Hunters to the next step in retaking Helios. They then proceed to infiltrate a Lost Legion base, run by two Dahl officers, The Bosun and The Skipper, in search of an artificial intelligence, which Jack plans to use to build a robot army. After defeating Bosun, it is revealed that the Skipper, who renames herself Felicity, is the A.I. they were looking for. Next, the Vault Hunters travel to a robot production facility, where Jack enlists the help of a scientist named Gladstone to build his robot army. Gladstone suggests using his prototype robot, named the Constructor, which has the ability to construct an infinite amount of robots. At first, Felicity agrees to help them by becoming the A.I. for the Constructor, but upon witnessing the violence she has to go through,she begins to hesitate. After being forced into the Constructor bot, she takes control of it and battles the Vault Hunters. Felicity is defeated, and her personality is deleted from the Constructor bot.  Having now achieved his robot army, Jack and the Vault Hunters travel to Helios, while enlisting the help of Moxxi and two former Vault Hunters, Roland and Lilith (who were on Elpis for a vacation). They defeat Zarpedon and the Lost Legion, and proceed to reboot the Eye of Helios. It is revealed that the Eye is actually the eye of the Destroyer, the beast that was released from Pandora's Vault by the first Borderlands vault hunters team. The Vault Hunters then begin to inject slag into the Eye, under Moxxi's directions. When attempting to reboot, Moxxi reveals her true motives for helping Jack: to destroy the Eye and prevent Jack from gaining ultimate power. Jack and the Vault Hunters then travel back to Elpis, where they find its Vault having already been opened, as mentioned by Zarpedon during her last moment. The Hunters then battle several of the Vault's guardians, and defeat its ultimate weapon, the Deva-like Empyrean Sentinel.  With the Sentinel defeated, Jack enters the Vault and greets the Vault Hunters, but finds no item of value, other than a mysterious symbol floating midair. As he attempts to interact with it, the symbol then shows Jack a vision of the Warrior awakening. However, the vision is interrupted by Lilith, who phasewalks in front of him and punches through the Vault symbol, burning it onto Jack's face. She then disappears, leaving Jack behind with the Vault Hunters. Jack, having gone insane from the vision as well as Lilith's attack, swears vengeance on her, and all the 'bandits' on Pandora. Realizing that the hero who once saved her on Helios is no more, Athena leaves Jack's employ.  Having finished listening to Athena's story, Lilith then orders the Crimson Raiders to execute her, against Brick and Mordecai's protests. However, as they open fire on her, Athena is saved by the alien warrior who appeared on Helios with Zarpedon that day, which reveals itself to be one of the legendary Eridians. The Eridian then warns the Vault Hunters of an imminent war, and that they would need 'all the Vault Hunters they can get'.  During the credits, several scenes showing what became of the Vault Hunters after helping Jack play. Wilhelm is transformed further into a machine, Athena discards the money given to her by Jack, Nisha and Jack establish their reign on Pandora, and Claptrap is dismantled and left for dead by Jack. In a post-credit scene, Jack is seen strangling his CEO, Tassiter, in his office, and announces to a woman on an intercom that he has replaced Tassiter as the new head of Hyperion, and tells her to now call him by his new name, Handsome Jack.",1
"It's actually pretty good. There's a pretty steep upgrade barrier to cross at first if you want to be any kind of useful, but if you invest 20$ or so into it you can get yourself some vehicle or MAX (think 'power suit') weapon upgrade that will last a good long time. You can even try different weapons for half an hour first (on the Unlock screen) to see if it's worth getting. You get certification points even while not playing, up to about 24 (one per hour), which isn't much at all compared to the top-of-the-line upgrades that cost 500-1000, but it's still nice. Just watch out for the Authentic Internet Experience of getting less teamwork than you should and more jagoffs than you'd like.",1
"Graphics are sub par, its clearly a console port. The gameplay is bad as well, you can basically rambo through every level, you usually have to allies with you and if you do they don't do anything, the computer AI is very dumb also. I wouldn't recommend. CO2 singleplayer is 1000 times better than this. The story is horrible too, don't waste your money even if its on sale.",-1

If you are willing to try this, I want you to not think about the war that's happening on the internet. I'll be honest: Depression Quest is not really a game, it's not something that you'll have fun with, it's just something else. Something that you have to see with your own eyes. I recommend it. It deals with certain aspects of life, that have an important meaning to all of us. When you read this, you can easily imagine yourself in that kind of position, you can imagine a friend of yours having these kind of problems, everyone should give it a try, at least to try to understand how depression feels, and why it's important that we understand these kinds of things.

"What really made me buy this game were the hair physics. So well done, so fluid.... I still have dreams about them..  Anyways, if you've played the other Tomb Raider game released in 2013 you need to get this one as well. It's a must. Usually, the second part to a game that comes out 'quickly' is bound to be bad or not live up to the expectations. This one however, took my expectations to a romantic dinner and proceeded to **** them all night long. That's how good this game was.  Compared to the first game this one is 10 times better. It's longer, there's more side quests (not that many though) and there's tons of little things to explore that add up to the lore of the game a little bit. I still haven't collected all the little things in the game or checked out the other game modes but I will soon enough :) Graphics are extremely good and the game is well optimized. They even added DirectX 12 support as of today which does absolutely nothing to my performance but whatever, it might work wonders for others lol.  Overall this is a very solid game and great port. Good job Crystal Dynamics &amp; Square Enix, you've nailed it!",1

"First of let's take the comparison with PD2000 out of the park. Yes they look alike but i find that they can easily stand next to each other in anyone's library.  I do put an upvote on this one cause at 1.79$ it's pretty fun but i would like to address some problems i didn't think i'll have based on the videos i've seen.  Pros:  1. Awesome retrowave vibe, alot like PD2000 but with a endless driving mechanic 2. Based on music and works as a music shop where you can find New Retrowave artist. Hope in the future artist will share music thru this game - also awesome collision detection (when you collide the music slows down like on a bad cassette player) 3. Intro sequence pretty nice 4. Car handles smooth and nice  Cons: 1. Lack of options. Should have key bindings since you accelerate with Shift instead of A 2. Lack of information at the beginning. You should know what the controls are from the start 3. Lack of controller support, i have yet to find the acceleration button on an xbox controller.  All in all i think that people should stop attacking the developer who was kind enough to give a bunch of keys even if the game is 1.79$ who is constantly explaining that he did this for his love to retrowave music and not for the money. Also i see a lot of potential if he chooses to work further on some small updates as mentioned above.  So yeah, i recommend buying it",1

there are a few small things that still need to be fixed but at the rate that they are updating he game and responding to are msg about the problems this has my vote for the game of the year this is the closes thing to realife that some times i dont know if i am in game ore not the textures the mods are all fanominal this game makes me wonder what there planing to do for 2019. if any one is to consider bying this game i gratly recomend this to everyone of all ages if you have the pations to do it as there is so much to do and so much more to come,1

"Most games try to be overly complicated or too simplified. I think Gauntlet straddles that line perfectly.

"HM is frenetic, amazing, visceral, emotional, detailed, and terrifying. I think that it is visually and musically terrific though it is truly love it-or-hate it. The masked 'hero's' goal is to murder every white-suited man in a level, by punching, strangling, shooting, bludgeoning, or stabbing, and failing that, with swinging doors and throwing whatever he has on hand. Preferably rapidly and in one swift motion. Things are frenetic and you die frequently, so it quickly becomes a game of muscle memory. This is a sore point though, as the mouse control is a little sloppy, and it becomes difficult to make moves quickly enough on the fly.",1
"Edit: after 30+ hrs, I'm revising my initial positive opinion. The mid-late game of Stellaris is weak, boring, unfinished and while Paradox marketed this game as a 4X grand strategy, it has almost no late game diplomacy option (and missing features listed in the dev diaries). Hold off on buying this game unless you are new to strategy game and wait for some major content patch/DLCs.   ________________________________________________________________________________   A tentative thumb up.  First of all, Stellaris is NOT a grand strategy game like other Paradox's titles - it's more Sin of a Solar Empire than CIV or EU. You'll need a dozen or so hours into the game before the realization hits and Paradox is definitely fudging the truth and letting their CK/EU/HoI reputation influence unwary buyers.   You'll definitely enjoy the first dozen hours or so of the game and the sense of wonder as you explore the galaxy is the best I've seen in the genre. However, if you are looking for something deep like Crusader Kings etc, wait for the inevitable DLCs. Currently, diplomacy, empire management are bare boned while trade, culture, espionage are non-existent.   Currently, this is a vanillar CIV V with no DLCs - the potential is there but it's definitely not here yet. This is perhapes one of the weakest, mechanically speaking, or all Paradox's franchises.  On the technical front, game runs without an single issue for 30 hrs or so on a 5 year old machine so that's a big plus in this age of launch day disasters. =)",-1

"A great stealth game that should be immediately bought by fans of the genre.  At first I had my reservations because I just didn't understand the setting, a steampunk setting where guns and machinery like arc pylons exist. But once I played the game the story is actually pretty good.  There is no open world like Skyrim, but a series of places much like Deus Ex: Human Revolution. But each place gives you numerous ways to complete your objective, whether by stealth, climbing through rooftops, possessing a rat to enter tunnels, etc.  There are 2 ways to complete the game, low chaos, the 'good' way where you kill as little people as possible, or high chaos, the 'evil' way where you kill too many people.  Strongly recommended for people who enjoy stealth games.",1

"I don't often write reviews about games on Steam but I felt compelled to write this one. Generally speaking, the game is meh, just meh. It has a huge amount of potential but there are so many bugs, so much stupid AI, and so much lack of attention to detail by the programmers (i.e. hearing bird chirps and wildlife sounds while deep underground in the bowels of a research center - kinda funny actually). But what is monumentally irratating, beside of the fact that the game does not produce your upgrades fast enough so you are constantly more poorly equipped than the enemy you are fighting - and consequently die a lot, is the fact that your save file will randomly become corrupt and when you restart, the game will crash. Sure you can re-load an older save file but all that work and time spent is gone and without fail, it will happen again. Very frustrating. The game is finishable and I don't have the patience to continue. Sad considering how long this game has been out and how many patches have been pushed. Uninstalling and moving on to a more competently desgined, less frustrating game.",-1

"Ridiculous moment where you calculated the fire before but still screwed up. Pure comedy. especially if you play multiplayer.   Battle takes on a predetermined landscape, and you control a group consists of several cute worms. Blast your enemy groups before they blast yours. Utilize the environment and weapons to get an upper hand.  DLCs add more single player contents so if you genuinely have fun with this game, they're worth buying.",1
"Got it as part of a bundle. Conceptually it's cool and looks nice.  Execution is shoddy. Prepare to be frustrated with the controls and collectable typeface glyphs that are way too difficult to get. Nit, but in a game about typography I'd expect the informational text to be better written and the layout to n o t b e p o o r l y done.  Put an hour into it before I was more frustrated than amused. Will probably run it in the background to collect the cards. :P",-1
Facerig is a software where you can take the role of a character and control them by moving yourself around. It took me a while to actually find HOW to change characters (this should be explained when you start the game) The only thing I hate about this game is the looks my family give me when I'm tilting my head around and posing to the webcam XD Overall a fun game. I would buy it only when its on sale though. Its not worth the whole price (in my opinion),1

"9.5/10  genre : point and click adventure game in 3rd person  + high production values, beautiful art, great character models, especially Zoe is very well designed, stunning environments and worlds + excellent voice acting, one of my favorite soundtracks, music is both epic and emotional + the story is one of the best you can find in gaming, heart breaking and emotional, other times dark and mysterious - the writing and dialogues are better than most movies you have ever watched - you continue the story of the previous games in the series, following the journey of the 2 heroes in parallel worlds, of science and magic, reality and dreams, order and chaos + gameplay wise it's a point and click adventure game in 3rd person - there are inventory based puzzles, puzzles are scarce but well thought , but the most important part of gameplay is observation and dialogues, where the choices have consequences, the path changes according to them and the balance is shifted - combining items in inventory or choosing the appropriate action when interacting are also basic gameplay functions + pretty long for episodic game, the 2nd book i'm playing right now seems to be twice the size of the 1st one - replayability is also good since most people will replay it to see the alternate results of their actions  - it would be a 10/10 game for me if it wasn't for the optimization issues and frame drops on large open areas, it has been fixed a bit since the release but it still needs some work - some animations could be better, but for an adventure game they are way above average  the whole series of longest journey/dreamfall is very special to me, it just feels that playing these games and following the story is something more than just gaming - makes you feel things and maybe reconsider some things in your own life - ofcourse the game is recommended to everyone , although it would be wise to play at least the longest journey first to understand the worlds since despite the fact that there is a story recap it's not enough.",1

"Got all the achievements as of today in 11,6 hours. And I made it FULLY AND COMPLETELY ALONE! NO COOP AT ALL!  Each level is called a 'Trial', there's 25 of them, you must finish them and do the challenges to unlock skills and perks, 8 for each categorie, 3 max to equip for each of them and for each of the 4 characters. You must learn and understand the synergy between the skills and the perks for mastering your character and ace those trials.  It's simple graphics, simple gameplay and simple composition, but yet you'll get challenged all the time. And it's the best part of this game: THE CHALLENGES! If you don't like challenges or are naturally challenged by games in general, don't think about buying it because you won't go far by not doing these. Also, don't go for the full price, maybe at 25-33% at least... ?  Maybe and certainly nice in coop, but doing it solo was so challenging BUT FEELS SO DAMN GOOD BY THE END OF IT! I EVEN WROTE THIS REVIEW WITH SUCH A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT NEARLY NO GAMES AS GIVEN ME! DIFFICULTY WELL-BALANCED!  Only little dark point in all this (but not frustrating): Skills/Perks distribution isn't really good (getting the last perk when you fully complete all challenges... not smart...) and characters, even if well marked, doesn't feel like well balanced: it'll be a lot easier to play Frost Shield than Volcanic Hammer, both can deal heavy damage but the shield got more heals, damage nullifiers &amp; speed boosts. Oddest part: Ice Shield alone is the fastest character by movement speed... faster than STORM BOW WHO SHOOT LIGHTNINGS!  Edit: And... +1.9 hours for the Slightly Better Edition achievements fully done solo! Yay! \o/ (+ top global score as another trophy... yayay)",1
"A wonderful game that gives you the chance to experience your dreams of being a king and commanding armies! Live a glorious life of conquest! Raid your neighbors, plot against your family members, and usurp your allies titles and land! Die pathetically of herpes!  More seriously, it's a very complex game, but if you don't mind the effort, it's very much worth buying. The expansion pack DLC is very nice, but you probably want to get it on sale.  10/10 would assasinate my brothers for the good of the realm again",1

"You're a young up and comer. A manager of immense talent, that the big clubs don't seem to realise.   You start off at small local team AFC Telford. You're expected a mid-table finish. Sacked in December for a lack luster start to the season. Not the career defining start you were hoping for.   It doesn't take long before you get your next break. Vanarama Conference side, Wrexham take a chance on you. You think to yourself, perhaps a move to a foriegn team might be too big a step at such an early stage, but you go for it anyway. Wrexham find themselves in the relegation zone, and after a few great loan signings in the Januray transfer window, you finish in the top half of the table. Up the dragons.  Second season in charge, you suffer a sluggish start, but soon find your feet. You romp the league, your star right back nearly wins playr of the season, you win manager of the year and win the league by 15 points. Its happening, its finally happening. Lets see where the rest of your magnificent story takes you as you move up through the leagues.   Rating 9/10. Not a massive amount of variety so can get repititive, but if you're a veteran of the series like myself you will really enjoy this most recent installment.",1

"To hear my full thoughts on Lumino City, listen to the review on  Game Hoard Podcast  [soundcloud.com]   Lumino City is a point and click adventure game with a unique aesthetic. Everything in the game is a real life object that was built and filmed by the developer. The result is simply gorgeous and makes every new environment a joy to explore. It's amazing to me just how well everything is lit and animates. Combine this with a truly stellar soundtrack, and you have one of the most aesthetically pleasing games ever made.  However, the gameplay doesn't quite live up to the other aspects of the game. For the most part, it's standard adventure game fair, for better or worse. Generally the puzzles are well designed and the game gives you just enough information to let you figure things out. Many of these are little cut away minigames, which really added variety to the game.   Unfortunately, this is occasionally not the case and there is no clear idea of what to do next, what is interactive, or where you can go in the environment. The result is that you end up just clicking on everything you can until something happens. These sections frustrated me a lot and really took away from the fun of the game.  Overall I would still recommend Lumino City. Just be aware that sometimes you will get stuck and it may be better to just look up the arbitrary solution than try to solve it yourself in order to enjoy the game.",1

"With the release of Magic 2015 it seemed like Wizards of the Coast had finally been able to release a fun and functional piece of software. This, sadly, is not the case. Although the graphics are highly polished and there's a huge selection of cards to build your deck with, these are the only good points drowning in a sea of bad design. To start with you're forced to choose a starter deck which is anemic at best. In order to fortify your pathetic deck you fight AI opponents with vastly superior decks seemingly designed to irratate you into forking over more real money just to make your deck competitive. Didn't shell out money and yet somehow still find yourself winning the game? No problem. Stainless games thought of this eventuality. The AI cheats. Constantly. Especially on higher difficulties. Drawing the perfect opening hand every game, knowledge of what's in your hand, and drawing the perfect card the AI needs, everytime. On top of all this, the frustration engine that is Magic 2015 is actually missing features from previous versions. Stick with the old Microprose developed Duels of the Planewalkers. It's far superior, even after 18 years.",-1
"I played Wurm Online for a good 9 solid years. I was genuinely hitched on it. Ultimately I burned out and after a good year hiatus I got Wurm Unlimited.  If you've ever played Wurm Online, that's the gameplay you're going to get, but with some changes you can make like the rate you gain skills, the amount of creatures, speed of crops.   Unfortunately, there really isn't much more than that.  This is probably one of the messiest pieces of software on the Steam store from a functional standpoint. You're given barely any maps to use in your servers, and if you want more you'll need to use programs that aren't packaged nor even mentioned in Wurm Unlimited to get them.  The actual launcher client for picking servers is pointless in its design, as it just shuts itself down once you're in and if you don't like a server you're going to get really annoyed when you have to keep relaunching the full thing to just pick a new one.  As for customization, this was clearly an extremely quick job when they decided to let Wurm be privatized. The UI is extremely annoying to navigate, it has search options when trying to spawn items that can't even search for things when you type them exactly right or only partially, you have to get the amount it wants to search for just right.  You want to customize something on your server? That means restarting of course. But not just the server. Turns out if you are playing your server you will be forced to shut down that client too before you can host a server again because the game is poorly integrated to cope with Steam relying on one-instance being up. EDIT: By this I mean that if you restart your client, you can't relaunch it without shutting your server down, because Steam thinks the server is the main game executable.   Wurm itself is a very *VERY* dated game and it's been suffering from that for a long time. It's received no quality-of-life improvements in the last few years, and for its age and graphical fidelity, it still has pretty horrendous performance on the CPU side of things.   It's a shame there's no really good modern alternative to Wurm, but it is time to admit this is just too old to work these days. The performance is horrendous even on CPUs like an i7 6700k, the UI is extremely dysfunctional and tough to use (nor can it even scale properly). They keep stacking features on overtime but it's just devolving into a mess that's struggling to still be called a program that can run.",-1
"(NO SPOILERS), okey just a little  When I first bought 'Gone Home' on sale, I had no idea what to expect from it, and neighter did I know what kind of game this was. But it looked like a interesting mystery type of game, set back in the 90s, which is a interesting time period for a game, especially if you have a childhood from the 90s (not me though). There is no combat or puzzels in the game, all though the game is a puzzel it self......  To enjoy 'Gone Home', you have to like slow-paced games, and you need to have patience, because you are going to read A LOT in the game to find out more about your missing family. This is a story-driven game, so if you don't engage in the story, there it's no point in playing it. You must search every corner, read every piece of paper, and listen to every tape you find, because that's how you get ahead in the game, and experience the amazing story.  After 5 minuttes of playing, I quickly got a creepy feeling, because you learn fast that this is a real SCARY game, more scary then many horror games out there. You are all alone in this big old house, and the game doesn't even try to help you out. You have to turn on all the lamps in the house, because you have no flashlight or anything. What's great about the game, is that while you are playing, you will probably come up with many conclusions about your family's disappearance. Is it something supernatural, or maybe not? Inside every room there is somehow a clue to find out the deeper truth.  I would strongly recommend to use a headset while playing at night. The game should be 3-4 hours, and has no replay value, but this is the kind of game that you only need to experience once, despite of how short the game is. I would also recommend not to play the game in more then on period, because of how short the game is. It would be like watching half a movie one day, and the rest another day, it kind of looses that 'vibe'.  This is an outstanding game that differs from the rest. I don't normally play games like this, but I think it's good for everyone to play something else then 'Dota' and COD'. All in all, this is a must own game on steam, trust me on this one.",1
Strangely soothing.,1

"This is probably the best zombie co-op game I've ever played. It has a great community, and the game itself is amazing, intense, and overall just fun to play. I'd definitely pick it up if you don't already have it. It may be quite a few years old but still a great buy.",1
"Okay.. what the hell did I just play? Keep in mind I'm usually giving the benefit of the doubt.. but what in the actual hell.   Mechanics  Wonky and confusing at times, say the first level alone took me roughly ten minutes to figure out even though the game tells you how to set it up.   Graphics &amp; Sounds  The sounds are fine, the graphics however will be giving my nightmares for days on end now, those 'cats' if they can even be called are the most hideous things ever. It's no wonder the mice want to murder the cat.   Gameplay  Pretty standard and basic, easy once you figure it out and no real skills to be accomplished or moments that make me jump for joy when I do something so amazingly awesome that I fall out of my chair from the sheer excitement, sadly that is not this game. Personally I'd have more fun playing with my old Mouse Trap board game and randomly build it near my cat to have the marble role onto him and mildly annoy him.   Overall  I don't ever remember even buying this game, maybe I was drunk, but hopefully I got it on sale because I'd rather use my 1$ for a cheap hooker. I mean at least I got cards to work on my next badge.  (I'm also in a bad mood, so if you're the devs, just re-read and scale it back 30% because I probably can't think nicely with my anger.)",-1

However, it doesn't take long to notice that EVERYTHING is locked behind a paywall. Shared bank, skill slots, inventory space, pets, mounts, etc. The 'free' part of the game is extremely limiting, to the point where you don't even have an outfit to wear after your promotion gear expires. The cost of a permanent outfit is at least $20-$30 dollars, and its only per character.   Save yourself the time and find another game.",-1

"I bought FFXIII during Steam sale and really just paid a few bucks for it, and I am happy about it.   Final Fantasy XIII is a lite RPG that lives solely on the beautifully animated characters and the cutscenes, features that all Final Fantasy parts in the last 10 years offered, but lacks everything else which would make this game a nice role play game experience.  While not in fights, you just walk straight ahead. No secrets, barely any secret ways, at least not in the first 6 hours, no open map, different approaches or something like side quests. Basically you just run from one area to the next, interrupted by a couple of fights (which consist mostly of pressing A) and already mentioned cutscenes. You don't gain experience anymore, there is nothing such as mana, you can just cast your spells as often as you want. After each fight, all characters are completely healed, which makes Final Fantasy XIII a real simple experience.   While other Final Fantasy parts such as Final Fantasy VIII could impress with a twisted and complex story, the story background of Final Fantasy XIII is absolutely lame, hopes of the story developing into something exciting will probably lead to frustration. At last, the graphics, apart from the nice faces, can't really compete with other games with the same age. Even with Anti Aliasing and in FullHD, FFXIII only looks slightly better than a 2006 shooter, there are barely any reflextions which take a lot of the vividness of the world. Considering the almost 60 GB Final Fantasy occupies on the hard drive, I really can't explain the super low resolution textures.  In a conclusion I can say, Final Fantasy XIII is rather an interactive movie with toddler-level fights than a role play game, as it lacks many defining elements of such a game. Compared for example to Skyrim, which came out at about the same time, the only point FFXIII hast over Skyrim is the more attractive main character, but thats it.  I played Final Fantasy since the first part, and while I loved Final Fantasy VI, VII and VIII, to me, Final Fantasy XIII definitely is the weakest part so far and you can carefree save the money for this game.

"The first PC Musou port (counting Steam releases) and I'm willing to give Koei the benefit of the doubt that they didn't have a lot of experience with ports at the time but the port still has issues that need to be addressed. Those issues aside the game is a blast. 4 good storylines that are about 5-6 hours each, fun challenge mode and a 'Create your own Empire' mode that I spent a good 40 hours on 100%ing. Nonetheless, here are the issues with the port:  - PS3 port graphically instead of PS4 - No controller button prompts - No online multiplayer (PS3 and PS4 versions have this)",-1
"Far Cay 4, overall, is a fun game, if you liked Far Cry 3 its pretty much the same game with some added features (elephant riding, grappling hook, more guns, different side missions etc.), but I cannot recommend the game. The combat is fun, the guns feel solid when shooting, the enemies are smart and our out to kill you along with all the animals. Pretty much Ubi got everything right….but the story.  The story felt very flat and lackluster with the main character very emotionless and bland. For Pagan being the protagonist was utterly the worse “protagonist” in a game. There was nothing intimidating or fearful, or tough about him. Even with the ending(s), ubi’s story telling has really gone downhill. This is prominent in there other games (example, Watch Dogs) and FC4 is no different.   If you can, just buy and play though FC3, it had a much better story that actually left you feeling like you didn’t waste your money. I for one, am done with ubi’s AAA titles until they release a franchise.   TL;DR: If you want FC4 for the story be prepared to feel very disappointed. If you can care less about the story and just want to do everything else that you did in FC3 this I would get it on sale.  EDIT: Also the game crashed on me multiple times, even at times of importance.",-1
"Let me preface this by saying you'll likely find more in depth and comprehensive reviews elsewhere. That being said, I still wish to give my opinion and hopefully someone will find it helpful.  Dark Souls III is, if nothing else, enjoyable. Yes, it does have some problems, as I'll get into later on, but it certainly does have a lot going for it.  PROS:  - Gorgeous levels, this game is home to one of the prettiest bits of scenery I've ever seen in gaming  - Boss design is varied and fun  - PLENTY of different weapons to suit anyone's individual preferances  - Very active community  - The OST is top notch  CONS:  - Invasions are swayed far too heavily in favor of the Host  - From a PvP standpoint, magic is all but dead. It can still be done, but it's the hardest it's ever been  - Too much pandering to the Dark Souls I fanboys for the sake of fan service",1
It won't let me run the game properly.,-1
"WOW!!!!!!!!! Just beat single player, thos has to be one of the most epic story plots for a shooter yet, graphics are great but the story plot has so many dam twists its a roller coaster!!!!",1
what the ♥♥♥♥,-1
"Good story, good design. Not 100% RTS as it seems turn based. Lack of a custom singleplayer mode.",1
Avoid this game. Laggy controls and repetitive levels. Do yourself a favour and get a Bit Trip Runner game instead.,-1
"I have over 700 hours played of EU/EW/Long War  Pros: Overall, they managed to make the game different, while keeping or expanding upon what makes Xcom one of my favorite games ever.  -Base-building is less annoying -The new classes are interesting and cool -Weapon mods and PCS were a good, interesting addition -They removed the Scope which was too good and almost everyone used -They took a note from Long War and allowed more varied items to be used early in the game -The difficulties are imo done better -Scientists and Engineers are less numerous and more significant, and they have their own appearances -The modding scene has been great (turn off the timers instead of crying about it, but I think they're fine, and aren't as punishing as they were in timed EW/LW) -You can re-spec troops -More interesting options for grenades/armor -Hacking is an enjoyable addition -The Grappling hook is much cooler because it and many more things now DO NOT end your turn -Instead of Interceptors and original-Gameboy-quality space battes, you get to travel around Earth and gather the nodes you think are most important -This game is better than a 75% approval rating  Cons:  *The game runs far too poorly, so be aware (there are some fixes/recommendations available on the interwebz) -The music is probably a little bit worse than in the other one -The Mimic Beacon is overpowered -You run out of research by the end of the game, which seems poorly balanced -No MECS or gene mods yet (but they kinda still exist in other forms) -A lot of the changes they made to the UI were imo downgrades ",1
"Just another 'not a bad game but not a great game either'  This is the first and original Call of Duty. The game that started the franchise. I suppose it was a good game back in the day but I can't say that today. Graphics are still good but the story is basically non-existent and there is no coherence between the 3 storylines (american, british, soviet). Also the gameplay is kinda dumb and incredibly easy. Just run and gun. W+M1 game...  ",1
Super fun + Cringey conversations + Stupid ping + Noob shams + Addicting + Stats = Transformice a.k.a tfm,1
"Gwent, that is all. The mini game is superior to other games.",1
"Realy great game. I think that everyone how like Point n' Click games, should play in this game.",1
Probably the best multiplayer/single palyer game I've ever played. This game has everything- hard boss fights; tons of ways to develop your character and many different playstyles and many zones to explore and hidden items to find.,1
This game may look terrible or after hearing what's used for the in game models people are mixed about it. Honestly The Dream Machine blew me away with it's great game design with amazing audio. Some of the best puzzles in any point &amp; click game. There really isn't enough to say about this game. I highly recommend it to those into that genre or want something different. It doesn't disappoint both ways especially when things gets interesting.,1
"Story isn't that great, pretty generic rpg with mediocre writing. It uses default assets and isn't polished, having several bugs/inconveniences (collision detection: invisble walls, clipping through walls, unobtainable summons, rpgmaker poor xbox controller support/no d-pad, not enough analog deadzone, etc)",-1
"I found the difficulty to ramp up to 'grind map until you figure out the 'one way' to beat it'. Not particularly fond of not being told what things are or what things do or otherwise notify me of what is happening by way of tooltips billboards and other informative cues. By the time you get to level 5 you better have memorized what towers do and where they are best placed and partnered with through repetitive behavior or you might get too frustrated to keep playing. Once you figure out what the towers are and what creeps they are powerful against the game gets a lot more fun. Which by the way, can take up to several hours to the 'new to tower defense genre' player. This is a grinder TD game similar to Prime World: Defenders and Ancient Planet or even Defense Grid. If you are a hard core TD nut you'll like the challenge of learning the game through tens if not hundreds of hours of trial and error. But to those who like to have a strategy that is derived from data and information given to you by the game, will not play this game much at all and might get 10 hours out of it in total. At the time of writing I have 2.1 hours of play time and plan to give it at least another 25 before I give it a solid judgement.  How much range or power or whatever a tower has is not known to you in the game other than the 'info' tab on the front page.﻿ I have yet to find out what the enemies are and what they do other than memorizing their cute little sprite and alocating -&gt; thats a land unit, or that's a land unit with armor, that's a flyer...etc...   Pros-  Love the music and color scheme Beautiful backdrops Creative comic book load and cutscenes Fast Action Not overwhelmed with zillions of towers/upgrades/creeps and other choices given to the player  Cons- Take any run of the mill tower defense game and change the theme and you have this game. Does not properly inform the player about the game or the units in the game User Interface lacks style and creativity Game difficulty over time can become impossible to the casual player early on Game maps seem to be 'one way' solutions or at best minimal types of tower pattern(partners) solutions",1
9/10 Like skyrim but with guns.,1
 Offline and still get the money. Hmmmmm.. Sounds 100% capitalist! ,1
Local co-op fun pure! Comes with an awesome campaign and a fun versus mode with addable AI (total 4 players in versus).,1
Very fun if u like killing hordes of mobs and getting rich doing it,1
"lots of fun and suvivall, build anything, make anything and win and obtain things to continue, a beloved game and highly recoended, though i do recomend looking at the wiki",1
Singleplayer masterpiece! Don't miss it! 9/10,1
Beat Hazard is a short and sweet investment that is given solid longevity the effects elsewhere are cool with a nod or two to old school arcade shooters. I'm already having such a super fun time! It is very challenging  Highly recommended,1
GAME IS HARD. get 6 friends or a couple friends and some random guys from the internet to join a server. Get 1 of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns watch everyone walk funny and get DEAD!!! My favorite gun is shotgun for the bio lab thats all i played so far and i beat it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! had light armor and got shot up like 4 different times but lived so this game has messed up life meter or something.,1
"THIS IS THE CRAZIEST SOURCEMOD EVER CREATED IN THE HISTORY OF MAN.  Install the improved translation mod before you do anything -at all- with this game. Play as a rambo character and become overpowered first before specializing in hacking or psi powers.  If games were like alcohol, EYE is like a terrible-tasting and mysterious throat-burning whiskey that also makes you hallucinate and you have no idea what is even happening, but it is awful and amazing at the same time. The balance of the game is absolutely horrendous. Stealth, hacking and psionic builds will be hard-pressed to gain any experience, money or leverage at all; If you are not a ghost-in-the-shell holocaust murder agent you are the equivalent of someone with an english major.  The only way to make money or gain experience efficiently is to kill hundreds and hundreds of enemies or speedrun side missions, which could take up to an hour. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly huge and are designed to be labyrinths. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY XBOX HUGE. It takes maybe 5 minutes to run from point A to point B, where dozens of high-level enemies constantly spawn close to you and make it impossible to catch a break or to heal yourself. Always upgrade your cyber legs.  The AI is actually kind of smart and very vicious; they will throw grenades, rush you, corner you and flank you for any chance they get; when there is a 6-story tall cyberdemon only inches between you and a foot soldier, you are still enemy number one. If you dislike constant long-range combat, modify it such that enemies will only notice you at shorter distances and you'll have an easier time with both stealth and gunplay.  Besides all of that, this game has an overwhelmingly chaotic atmosphere, very well-done dystopian aesthetics, and swarms upon swarms of enemies that present a constant threat and danger throughout the game. The developers crammed so many elements into the game that an invisible rambo super-fast armored gunslinging cyborg ninja who hacks into people's brains, uses psionic powers and jumps 6 feet into the air is UNDERPOWERED.  Cons: Bad translation, incomprehensible to the layman, horrible balance, STUPIDLY GIGANTIC XBOX HUGE MAPS (I cannot stress this enough), no tutorials, a few bullet sponge enemies and a punishing autosave system.  Pros: It will all be worth it if you want your head to explode from all of the chaos. I still have PTSD from the Mars mission. This game leaves me wordless to say what really went on in my mind when every element culminated into blasting down helicopters and cyberdemons the size of grand canyons left and right.",1
"This game was once called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. It takes place in Cold War period on 3 islands. In the Cold War campaign you play as 3 different men. You can save only once on every mission, don't worry though because there are checkpoints too. Game is pretty fun and realistic once you get hang of it. What you might don't like is the choppy movement, not the best order menu and the fact that sometimes mission bugs out and you can't finish it unless you load the save or restart the game.  I also want to mention awesome soundtrack this game has and the fact that game comes with second camaign too, which is called Arma Resistance. It takes place before the Cold War campaign and as the title says, you play as resistance member. In Resistance there are also few new weapons. I reccomend buying this game, especially on sales.",1
"This game has made me feel emotions I didnt even know I had, I've never cried so hard in my life. I now suffer from crippling goat related guilt.  10/10 Masterpiece  Toby Fox is a genius",1
A fun game once you mod it until it's barely recognizable. Just don't pay paradox for any of their low effort paid mods because the community pops out higher quality stuff every week or two.,-1
This game makes me feel bad when i ♥♥♥♥ up  ,1
Killing Floor is the nice game.,1
"A fast-paced CoD-like WW2 game on the source engine, what more can I say?",1
it's fun making zombies go boom. 9/10,1
"In this game, you play with different quadrilaterals. Quite easy, simple, too short... but dammit, if a square named Chris becomes something serious you can relate to, then you know it's something more.",1
Incrediblely amazing!,1
A worthy sequel to a great reboot. Rise improves on the first game not only through adding more tombs and improving gameplay but also takes the graphics to the next level. I have over 250+ screenshots of this game because of how amazing it looks on max settings.   Overall 9/10. The sequel to the series that Uncharted copied shows once again that the Original &gt; Copy if done right.  I'd like to see more variety in areas for the next game. Syria at the beginning of the game looked stunning. More of it please!,1
"All the content of wurm, but you can speed up all the actions to make things achievable within weeks and not years.",1
"A game that has a lot of potentials, I like the idea of it being all almost blocky and 2D platformer. The game is logicaly, Re-Logic!",1
The best game for tapping and destroying your keyboard.,1
"HEard it was good, tried it out, blown away. Instant classic, pick up and play, and its just a good time. Get it.",1
in two words: a masterpiece! :),1
"Amazing game, make many more please!",1
It has 0 people in games. Would do better if had more people,-1
"Surprisingly great. Would love a part 4 or even another game. This has unique gameplay, cool stylistic elements and an interesting storyline and hidden items. A great game for its price.",1
"The wasteland is a classic style metroidvania style game. It offers a good mix of everything youd expect. My only issue is it feels too familiar making it a little lackluster at times, but regardless, its plenty of fun and worth your time.",1
"Fast paced, exciting, unpredictable. This is an excellent PVP multiplayer game. On top of that, it's just a really good dinosaur game. The maps have a Jurassic Park feel, the graphics are good so the dinosaurs look and move great, and playing as the dinosaurs is very rewarding. Just pounce on your first victim as a Novaraptor and you'll get why this game deserves to be in your library.  tl;dr: 'sgood, dinos real good, buy it",1
This game is amazing :D,1
This game will bend your feels over and **** them. x_x,1
"Ever play Super Mario and die to a single Goomba and lose a precious life? Ever wanted to rewind time so you could try again? What if there was a game that revolved souly around that? This is Braid, the awesome 2D platformer puzzle that will literally allow you to rewind your gameplay. Play as Tim as you quest to see the fairest Madien in the land (See my Mario Reference), solving puzzles with the ability to travel backwards in time to redo your mistakes. The game has an interesting art style and a great concept. Any Super Mario or puzzle game fans have to pick this up!",1
To speak plainly this game is rubbish,-1

"While I haven't completed or invested over 1200 in the legendary game of porthole 2, I can Thoreauly say it is one of the most influential and experiential JRPG's I've ever played. After only 2 hours of playing, I left my ex wife, and found my new husband. Without Protwhole 3, I would never be the pansexual I am today.",1
 What I liked:      You become a zombie instead of watching when you die     Is a hard game on some maps ( you can't always shoot your way out )     Escape mode is fun when I can find a game   What You Need to Know:      Has the smudge on camera effect     Graphics and effects are good     No one is playing this game     No More Room in Hell has 10 times the average players at any given time     The only mode I like has 4 maps (1 which is just boring)    My Score:,-1
"Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters. &lt;LIMBO&gt;  9/10.",1
"Best game ever, we need more Multiplayer games like this one!",1
When it started it was good. They eventually pretty much took everything away and made it all P2W. Not worth the time.,-1
"This is just bad writing. In what twilight-zone world can you get your sister's child murdered over your stupidity, and then be begged to come over for dinner?   Yet another massive ubisoft ♥♥♥♥-story.",-1
"This game is an excelent example of how to do phycological horror correctly, half the time you're left expecting the monsters to jump you only to find another safe hallway or room and then just as you breath a sigh of relief your worst nightmares come to life in a dark, cold, and terrifying encounter. This is an absolute must for those who are fans of the Silent Hill series.",1
"Prepare to Die a lot, and play it because it's aewsome!",1
The wolfenstien bundle costs less then the new order 10/10,1
"There's not much I can say without spoiling the experience.  The gameplay is pretty good as is, being a sort of turn based bullet hell game. Sounds pretty weird, but it works. But the story... That's ultimately what you will be here for. I honestly believe that if it weren't for the Witcher, this would stand a chance of being pretty much everyone's game of the year (No, I didn't forget Fallout 4).",1
"Clunky and unimpressive, there's little in the way of 'horror' here.",-1
This is amazing best survival i've ever EVER played!!!,1
"This game would be fun, and could be enjoyable, but the fov is locked to 60, making it unplayable.",-1
"I had bought this when it was released and have absolutely loved it. It's an amazing game based around discovery interesting story and a lovecraftian ambiance and Soundtrack that binds it all together nicely.  The Zubmariner DLC is an amazingly clever DLC it can take quite long an be quite boring to traverse the full length of the Map so adding content would be quite hard, however by simply giving one the ability to dive they have practically doubled the map size without fuel/length problem, lots of new stories, places enemies and of course, a new ending one can achieve. ",1
A good game with reactive narrative. The combat mechanics are enjoyable and the story is interesting too,1
"Crash to Desktop at Bridge with Machine Gun on it Hi there,  Trying to play three player online coop, and every time we get to this bridge, as it starts crossing over, the game goes completely haywire and characters start moving about everywhere. Eventually the host's computer crashes.  Tried running through in single player to the next check point, then inviting, but the game was still crazy after that. Characters running around in the background of cutscenes etc.",-1
"♥♥♥♥ yeah, this game brings me back. This game marked a great time in gaming history, and will always be a classic.",1
Very fun game. Lots of stuff to do.,1
I don't really understand what happens at the ending of the levels :D But the Game looks nice and I would really recommend it ;),1
Would recommend to any and all mammals. except for boars. ♥♥♥♥ boars.,1
very very very good game but how ever there is a few ups and downs to the game so its a good price for how long the game thats and there no end to it. My personal thought that should be in the game is a book with crafting recipes that you have all ready crafted so instead of always going to the wiki or giude. thats all i have to say its a great game i recommend it.,1
"My name is cammander chepard, and this is my favourite game on the ship",1
"Very good game. I played it for months before steam release. Its like Diablo 2 mixed with the materia system of Final Fantasy 7 mixed with the sphere grid system of Final Fantasy 10. Its a great game that allows you to customize greatly and you dont have to spend a cent to feel competative, its all cosmetics for money.",1
-love game been a big total war fan for a long time.   -good fun game to add to the library   If you own total war game this is a most have.dont let the 17.09 make you turn away for the game it still good game with out the dlc and if you hold off the the dlc it will come in a sale later on in the year.,1
"Don't know why I got this, all I'm going to say is... I Do NOT recommend it!",-1
A stunning improvement on Gothic 1 in every way. And it includes the add on as well which turns this game into one of the more difficult RPG experiences. And yes you still need fanpatches. Check the community guides.,1
"With its open-ended gameplay, exploration and countless items to craft, Terraria can easily offer hours of fun well into the hundreds. It's as cheap as a Big Mac meal and despite the lack of tutorial it is easily accessable, with initially simple mechanics and tactics required.  Moving into game further, using a Wiki or Guides for help would certainly be recommended. Playing with friends is also amost a definite for more enjoyment.",1

"Far Cry 2 is a very fun and open-ended game, as is the entire Far Cry franchise. Unfortunately, it seems to have an unusually large number of bugs, specifically dealing with changing the controls. If you can learn to live with the default controls, you should. Otherwise, be careful with rebinding keys, especially the Action/Use key.",1

people running around with high-tech weapons killing everything in their path.  and i get an m16 with limited time on it before it starts sucking even more than default.  1/10 just wanted a reskin.,-1
This game is absolutely amazing. It's so relaxing and soothing. It is definetly worth the $20.00 instead of paying $60.00 for CIV or SimCIty.,1
Batman Car????!!!?!?!?! 69/11 best game of the century would play again IGN rate 100/10 Metacritic says 1513910391/100 best game on Earth.  If you didn't catch the memo... I love Batman too much!,1
"This game has amazing graphics, nice story about mysterious ancient object, with wizard, knight, and thief. The game play is really fun, puzzle type in and adventure and action mode :p it worth playing :)",1
KILL CLAPTRAP!,1
"Way better than the first one. This game is still relevent, although its pretty low quality for today's standards.  Fun game, good play time. Achievements are fairly easy and simple.",1
"Don't bother.  The story is untranslated, it's glitchy, the combat lacks fluidity and there just isn't much point in playing it unless you want to look up the main character's skirt.  If you're cool with using the hard drive space for that then I won't be the one to judge cause it's the same reason I downloaded this too lmao",-1
"Everyone should try this game, it's only 10 minutes and it's worth it !!!!!    It will make you cry under 10 mins :'(  ",1
Don't run this game - you will be stuck for alot of time !!!,1
If you're quick with your fingers then play it. ^^,1
"Love the game, easy to play a mission here and there for an hour or so at a time, and it actually runs on my laptop!",1
Cool,1
I never realised how much fun this game could be! It combines RPG with platforming and hack and slash style gameplay to form this truly amazing yet simple game to life!  Intruder gives his trespassing seal of approval!,1
awesome game love it sooooooooooo much,1
Bad game. Controls unassignable to keyboard keys. Would reccomend a controller if you want to play this game. Big waste of money.,-1
"This is such a great game to me, it has amazing background stories, storylines, gameplay, you even get to slay a dragon. I recommend this game to all my friends. Its graphics are amazing, sound, actual gameplay, 3rd person game, I give it a 11/10.",1
"Pro: Steampunk Airship combat Steam cards Steam workshop Low system specs   Con: Multiplayer only Some game mechanices are convoluted or just stupid Thin tutorial Dead multiplayer Community is filled with experts and noobs, nothing in between Overpriced, should go F2P to get more players playing  Overall: 5/10 -1 price, -1 dead, -1 multiplayer only, +1 style, +1 cards, +1 concept = 5/10  An OK game that is dying and overpriced, hopefully this will go on sale during a big steam sale and get more players.

its a grat game for local multiplayer/skirmishes too bad online multiplayer isnt supported annymore,1
Great fun shooter with RPG elements and interesting graphics.,1
Fire in the hole!,1
if you ever wanted to drive expensive cars but know you'll never be able to afford them... haha u poor as hell  game is good but,1
"Absolute ♥♥♥♥, just absolute ♥♥♥♥, poorly made, outdated crap. Running a bloody GTX 980 Ti, this hunk of crap can still fall to 20 fps doing absolutley nothing, it overworks the GPU like it actually needs to try and do something, despite the games still running like crap.  It also crashes regularly and almost never runs perfectly, and if it does decide to lock up, oh your in for trouble, because if you try to end it through the Task Manager (Admin)  ACCESS IS DENIED  Perfect example of a game where nothing is fixed and everything is broken, considerably worse than Sonic 06 even.",-1
"One of the best games of the PS3 era and you can now play it on the PC. Fun tactical gameplay, interesting cast of characters and a war story that while it has it's dark moments doesn't get too bogged down in the harsh realities of war. The anime style may not be to everyones tastes but it never gets too caught up in it's tropes. Transition to the PC from the PS3 has been fairly smooth, some slight hiccups with the mouse and keyboard controls but nothing too major (and if you have a controller set up you won't even notice). Includes all the DLC and will give you roughly 35+ hours of gameplay (not including A+ ranking all missions and replays).   It's a fantastic game for a low price, I highly recommended you pick it up now rather than waiting for a sale, so hopefully SEGA gets the message and ports VC2 and 3...and maybe even works on a 4th. C'mon 7th Squad need you!",1
"My favorite VR game yet. The first bit can be nauseating, but was too much fun to worry about. Completed the game once to get through it, then stopped because I wanted to wait for the touch controllers for the ultimate play through of collecting every last thing. I always recommend this game, it is a truly fantastic experience that has entertained me and is fully worth the cost.",1
"This game is stupid. Doesn't tell you anything on how to play at first so you gotta go to the 'Keyboard Schmea' or however you spell it. After time this 'Crystal' you have you protect deals damage even if no enemies attack it, it doesn't allow you to advance. I really wish I could get a refund.",-1
This game.,1
"Love it. Chill atmosphere with great puzzles and perfect difficulty. It's one of my favorite indie games. Overall, a beautiful game. Got it on sale, but it was so good and well made that I wished I had payed full price just to support the creator. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1
Definitely a game for someone who is looking for lore and immersion in the 40k universe. A fun hack and slash.,1
"Best Nuclear Warfare simulator you'll get...Causes you'll die in the end and most defiantly not 'win'.  But to hell with it, you may loses but you'll take all those other countries with you and maybe...just maybe you will lose the least and so be Victorious... YYYAAA  But on whole fun game and great with freinds and online... may get boring but you'll probably go back to it and have fun.  Good luck commander and remeber the best plan... is to counter attack and subs",1
"If you want a game that has a great story with a bunch of feels this is for you. Some parts made me laugh, others made me tear up. It was a good time. I recommend playing this in 1 sitting for the full effect. Only moderate complaint for me was the 'gameplay' was a tad tedius at some points but the payoff was worth it.   Feels/10",1
"Basically Saints Row 3.5. The game play is the same, textures are the same, missions are just reskinned, etc..just a new story line to the old game mechanics. If you're looking for a tongue-in-cheek co-op campaign with a friend then this will suffice but wait until it's below $10 so you don't feel as disappointed as I do.",1
"I doubt this game will be for everyone. It's less of a game than it is a story. You play as Kaitlyn Greenbriar, who arrives back at her family home to find her sister gone. By exploring the house, you find out why. I don't want to say anything more about the story because the game is rather short, so it's best to experience it all for yourself. Gone Home features the vocal talent of Sarah Grayson, who is exceptionally good as Sam (Kaitlyn's sister). The original score by Chris Remo is atmospheric and adds to the sense of foreboding.  Overall, I'd recommend this game, however I think it's better to buy it on sale as the current price of £15 is too high in my opinion, given how it only takes a few hours to complete.",1
"Portal is a great game, with an amazing co-op, would definately recommend buying this, especially when its on sale. Worth all of the £4 you spend for it :",1
"There's no game like this one. Don't want to spoil it, so just play it, it's absolutely great!",1
"This was my first visual novel. About an hour in, I thought about abandoning it.  I am so glad I didn't.   Great horror story, one that makes you keep guessing! I hope the next chapter releases soon. If you're not interested by the time they play Clue, this isn't for you.",1
"I really enjoy this game because of it's ambition and presentation. The game in it's current state isn't complete and you can feel those kind of echos as you advance through various play-throughs. This feeling usually goes up as 'how does helping X get me closer to Y or how can this impact relations with race A.' Some of the newer patches make the game feel more complete and I really feel like the devs will keep making updates for this game.  The price is worth it in my opinion, you might be turned off at first by the fact that this is a 4X game where you control only a single person. This is why the game works, you feel like you ARE the last of an advanced race and that you ARE going to give fire to the other races. I really felt like It was my job to watch over these other races (most of the time) and the game seems balanced between being this merc and the actual race. You can't just nuke everyone off the galaxy (by yourself, any way.)   Alliances work pretty well in this game. A certain race can give aid to other planets, another can dump toxic waste and disrupt the economy, another can create deadly viruses and crash moons, and planets can even be destroyed. You can kill a Queen of a race, the senate of another, undermine a CEO's company, and kill the leading warlord in an honourable duel in order to get a better pull of that race decision making or to ruin their strength.  Combat is a bit simplistic but works very well and I found myself enjoying the combat system. It does get easier as you get stronger and more experince, so you can turn up the combat difficuility without making the strategy harder. Or you can turn up the strategy part and turn down the combat to make for a more decision-making gameplay. This is a very cool feature and I wish more 4x games would have this.  The solar system is a bit small in my opinion, but gets VERY VERY packed later in the game. After very long games, I loose the ability to speed through time because my computer ran the game very slowly due to the mass population of the system. This is likely more of a reflection of my system and less of a reflection of the game itself; besides the HUGE amounts of populations later in game, the game is pretty smooth.  Races are diverse and unique, but seemingly are in small numbers. I would love to see more races that can appear in different games (or not appear.) Planets seem to be quasi-random and I notice that race locations vary among games. Events are random and I've never had a game play the same twice (some times a 'bad guy' race and befriend a 'good guy' race and literally form a fear empire, or 'good guy' coalation can form a union of planets.) These alliances are your competition and can overpower the federation you are trying to create and kill you.   I really enjoyed this game and I praise the devs for the presentation and deliverence of the product. I look forward to updates and more games by these creators.",1
  I actually enjoyed the game. The story kept me interested to finish it on one sitting. The game never felt boring and always made me think on what i would do.

"É magnifico! Dark Souls III is a game unlike many others, the multiplayer RPG style let's you beat 'dungeons' together and both of you are rewarded for it making the experience not only fun but rewarding. Allowing others do invade other worlds adds a little suspence and challenge to the game so that it is never dull! There are multiple endings so when you 'beat' the game you can do something diffrent to make this new ending unique and who could resist taking becoming a lord of cinder? All in all this game is a pretty good one and I certainly would reccomend it to RPG enthusiasts.",1
"Another great Bioshock game! The mix of vigors (super powers) and gun play is perfect. The minor RPG elements (upgrading guns, vigors and your health/shields) add a fun depth. The story is similar in delivery to the first Bioshock - dialog, voice recordings, and some big moments. Also like the first one, a little convoluted. The graphics are beautiful, and the addition of flying around on skylines (and deletion of hacking mini games) is wonderful. Campaign is about 15 hrs if you explore a lot, less if you chug through.",1
"Portal is one of the most unique games I've ever played. While the layout of the game is ordinary, including the source engine, 3D maps, and simple hallways and puzzles to solve, the mechanism by which the puzzles are solved is mind-bending. After falling through a portal in the floor out of a wall ten feet above and flinging through the room, you get this queezy, nauseas feeling that makes you cry for more.  My only cons are these:  1) $14 bucks is a lot of cash for a game that lasts 2 hours, not counting challenges, the six advanced maps, and the achievements (which, outside of the achievements awarded for beating the challenges, are only very slightly cool). My solution: Buy it on sale or as part of the orange box, if you're interested in that pack.  2) Don't play this game before going to bed or you'll wake up with an upside-down stomach. I have the craziest dreams of flinging myself through portals unstoppably, finding myself in the most unexpected locations.",1

I really like it, and while the samples arent the best, when they mix with my music in serato dj they sounds fine. Overall a good buy for the price",1

"Few games manage to tell such a breathtaking story with such admirable minimalism as Always Sometimes Monsters does. What’s even greater is you are in control of the story, and how the game will pan out. For me, calling this a game is an understatement of what it really is. Always Sometimes Monsters is a declaration about life, about how our choices are all we really have, and about how those choices, no matter how small, can reorient our life in ways that we can never predict. In life there is regrets, happiness, anger, wishfulness and countless other human feelings. Always Sometimes Monsters shows that while experiencing these feelings is inevitable, you will never be able to travel back and reshape your life with different choices, so you have to make the best of what you have and never sink into regret with the decisions you’ve made in life, or you will never be able to move forward in the unique journey that is your life. 10/10",1
"Pros: - Excellent hand to hand combat, full of counters, breaks, and grapples that feel fluid and powerful. -Decent story that makes you feel something for the protagonist and what he's going through. -Characters don't just feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC's that are there for plot reason's. This ties into my previous point.  Cons:  Main Story fell flat mid way which caused me to stop playing for a while before I actually beat it. It felt like I was just playing it because it was the latest game. Although once I got back into it I had no problems completing it. -Annoying car controls, trying to be a good citizen on missions because that's the only way to increase one of your factions score usually ended up going right out of the window after one scratched paint job. -♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun play, once you get fire arms the CQC goes right out of the window and it turns into a 3rd person shooter. -Collectables... ♥♥♥♥ing collectables that are needed to increase your health bar which is needed for some parts of the game as tougher enemies means more deaths. -'Open World' means you are confined to the streets of the city and to get to the other side of the city you have to go all the way around in a massive loop which just killed my interest.  All in all, it's a decent game with sweet CQC which should have been the majority of the game with guns not being so heavily implemented mid way through. A good buy for people who enjoy the Arkham series combat system.",1
"A cliche-ridden plotless pointless pathetic visual novel that will, generously, take you two hours to finish.  Reads like someone's first freeware Ren'Py VN. It's shameful that it's selling for $9.99. I'm glad it was gifted to me. Don't buy unless it goes to $2 or less. If you really have to look at a scantily clad foxgirl, Google the CGs and spare yourself the pain of sitting through this game.  I put more effort into clipping my toenails than was put into writing this game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIDkgxgBq8  &lt;-- the only piece of media associated with this game that's in any way sexy or funny",-1
I highyl recommend this game. Hours upon ours of endless fun and enjoyment. Definitely a game that sucks you in!,1
Amazing game and probably in my top 5 story wise ever. I just picked my jaw up from the ground...,1
It's Ok.,1
until this game fixes there lack of servers issue and that damn queue time to play it i cant give this game a positive review dispite actuilly being fun to play and having a decent amount of content.  generally content can only be enjoyed if you can even get in the damn game.,-1
totally worth the money and that's what we all care about,1
"'The Sentients had won. They had turned our weapons, our technology, against us. The more advanced we became, the greater our losses. The war was over unless we found a new way. In our desperation we turned to the Void. The blinding night, the hellspace where our science and reason failed. We took the twisted few that had returned from that place. We built a frame around them, a conduit of their affliction. Gave them the weapons of the old ways. Gun and blade. A new warrior, a new code was born. These rejects, these Tenno, became our saviors. Warrior-Gods cast in steel and fury striking our enemies in a way they could never comprehend.'  You are a Tenno, an ancient race that excel at Blade and Gun. Waking up after a long time sleeping in the cryopod makes your memories fade away. Seeing the age is already changed drastically, you have no other choice but to follow the guidance from Lotus.   This game is a 3rd person shooter, Co-op mission, fast paced one, and F2P too! While it's still in Beta, this game is hugely anticipated by lot of people and widely known for it's fast-react developer, interesting update and event.  The gameplay is simple. Choose the missions, be it's a Exterminate, Capture, Survival, Mobile Defense, Endless Defense, or other type of mission. Solo or Find squad online? Your choice!  I won't spoil anything for this game, just fukken download it and try it! You will like it!   OH and some people think that Warframe is P2W, no it's G2GBG (Grind 2 get better gears). Weapon's blueprint is already on the market, but the resource isn't. So it's up to you to grind a lot to get it. Or you can toss some real-world money to get a better gear and cosmetcis item too..    And one more things...remember this  All action you take, be it helping one faction or killing bosses will have a consequences, beware Tenno",1
Very nice and completely Deus Ex just the way we like it. Littl buggy do. had a crash and somtimes menu's like books or newspapers dissapear making it impossible to exit them putting you in a frozen position. update would be fine. thank god for the manual save possibility :),1
"  This game isn't awful   , but you'll get easly bored by this game after 5-6 hours. The missions are so similar, that it's feels like you are repeating them over and over. And the only reason you may bother to do that is to experience the storyline which has quality. I like the fact they aren't p♫ssyfoting around subjects like racism. And I also like the soundtrack.   I have never understood why someone would watch others play games on youtube (and similar channels), but after experiencing this game i do understand. I would rather watch someone else play this game than play it myself, maybe even by someone as goofy as 'pewdiepie'. It might even be fun to see the boredom of this game suck the 'life-force' out of them, and maybe they will even question their existence in life and on youtube.",-1

"Without a doubt Torchlight 2 is an amazing game that worth your money.  Pros:  - Fun gamplay - 4 Classes to choose, each have 3 diffrent skill trees that you can explore with each playthrough.  - Excessable - You can play either Offline, Online or LAN creating a confertable experience unlike game such as Diablo 3.  - Highly rewarding loot - Torchlight 2 continues it's legacy of really kickass loot, making exploration more rewarding and fun  - Easily modiffed - The enclusion of Steam workshop making the torchlight experience last way way longer as the community is highly active and mods are constantly being produced that range from models, maps, gameplay and more.  - Cheap - The highest this game price can go is 20$ as the amount of content it offers you worths as a full rental 60$ game, and when you finish the original playthrough there are hunderds of mods awaiting you, also it's being disscounted to 5$, so you can wait for it if you have the patience.

"Metro: Last Light is a post-apocalyptic FPS which takes place in year 2034, and continues shortly after the events of Metro 2033 whereby Artyom   called in a nuclear strike against the Dark Ones  . While in Metro 2033 the occupants of the metro faced the threat of the Dark Ones, they now face a power struggle for control over a military bunker, called D6, which could provide food and shelter from the mutants for a long time. However, the imminent war could lead to the extinction of humanity and somehow, salvation lies in the hands of Artyom and his newfound friend.  While Last Light didn't have the scariest mutant 2033 offered, that being the Librarians, it still had some creepy levels and also moments such as the visions of the past seen in the Dead City. [The Librarians only appear in one of the many DLC levels and they still scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.] Like 2033, Last Light has 2 endings and the 'good ending' requires you to obtain enough 'moral points' as you progress through the entire campaign. This means doing charity/ good deeds, evesdropping on enemies and not killing unless you absolutely have to.  There were also additions that were not seen in the first game. For instance, there were 3 'boss fights' and while they were not too tough, I still had to blow most of my ammunition. Also, the Redux edition includes all DLCs released for Last Light, and while they didn't provide 10 hours of bonus content like they were supposed to, I still had a lot of fun playing as some of the most memorable characters from the campaign.  Lastly, Metro Last Light is one of the few games that I've gotten 100% steam achievements for. My gametime consists of 2 playthroughs (one for each ending), completing the DLC levels, and lastly replaying specific chapters for the no kills/ no alarm raised achievements.  9.5/10 would Russian again.",1
"I like that you build up the characters and trash mobs, the only problem I have seen is tring to make enough gold to unlock the higher end characters. I still get a kick out of the game.",1
it is the mother of the battlefield games (personal opinion) it is an great game but the only down site if you buy it now there are a lot of high levels out there. 7/10,1

"One of my most enjoyable experiences in gaming, played it for 150+ hours and it is simply one of the best games ever made. If you can I reccomend you to buy it.10/10",1
"When I read the reviews for this game, I was beyond excited about playing it. The art looked amazing, everyone raved about it, so I bucked up and bought it. Then I actually turned it on and started playing.   Words cannot express what I felt when I realized just how mindblowingly incredible this game was. I'm a sucker for a good story, and I'm also a sucker for RPG's. So many games have so little gameplay, or perhaps getting through the events are tedious. I admit, I expected something with pretty graphics and good music, but more along the norm with a few more twists behind it. This game though, shot beyond my expectations, which is saying something once you actually see the reviews posted for this game and take in your first pre-game impression.  The artwork and music are breathtaking, and the narrator, with his deep voice, makes this game more than worth every single penny you're putting into it, whether it was on sale or at full price. There are no random drop weapons, no cutscenes in the middle of a dungeon that take up ten minutes and make you wish there was a skip function, no. When you hear the story behind this whole world, see the characters, and interact with everything, all described and explained with the rich and gruff voice of Logan Cunningham, you're gonna love every moment. Trust me.  There's a story behind everything, from your enemies to the grey people standing in the streets. Behind every single item and piece of land that rises up and falls below, its difficult to not enjoy every moment of this game as it comes because of that.  Its also a bit ambiguous in story and plot elements, especially in the classical sense of fighting good and bad, in a beautiful way that melds perfectly with the fact that you play as a character who is trying to restore the only piece of a broken world so the survivors can truly start living and rebuilding.",1
"An amazing game from back in the early days of Bioware. The twist right near the end I never saw coming in that way Bioware have always been in great story telling. Apart from when they seemed to have become one with EA and messed things up, but I digress.  Game starts where the republic ship you are on is under attack from Sith fighters and you have to make your way off the ship, battling your way through sith soldiers and getting to an escape pod where the real meat of the game begins on the planet of Taris.  The game is based on the 3rd edition roleplaying game so if you have any experience with D&amp;D you'll have no trouble getting into this game. As i said before, it's classic Bioware with the great storytelling and characters that are so realistic and you end up caring about. You get the chance to become either a Jedi or Sith. Both sides have different types of powers that can be used in many different ways. This is a game I highly recommend for it's story-line and replayability.",1
Cute and lighthearted metroidvania with bullet hell bosses. This game also has lots of animes.,1

"As a long time fan of Battlefield and FPS games I rate Bad Company 2 among the best. After been dissapointed with BF4 I went back to playing BC2 and im having so much fun. Heres what makes it great -  - Great hit detection, You dont die behind walls &amp; feel cheated. - Better thought out level design. - More destructability than BF4. - Stil modern looking graphics. - Easy to find online games on any gamemode.  If you have never played BC2 before your missing out, In my oppinion its as good as BF3 &amp; better than BF4.",1
"Awesome roguelike / Isaac-like. I really like the style and the gameplay is tight. The music, while not one of those things I would listen to outside of playing (a la hotline miami) is still a bit better than serviceable. The whole thing is pretty well polished.",1
"Time to hop in our 'way back' machine and travel back to 2004. I remember when the tech demo of this game came out. It was right around the same time as Half-Life 2; another seminal game. I couldn't believe the lighting and physics possible in this particular game. And then the 'alpha' version got leaked. And we all saw just how incapable our PC's were at the time. Sadly, the game doesn't hold up well now. The character models pale in comparison to their first glance 9 years ago. Textures are a bit muddy. The gameplay was designed as a simple shooter. But come on, having to switch from flashlight to gun and vice versa? Lame. Now easily fixed with a mod. I personally got this game for the Phantasm mod that was released. Also the Doom Coop mod is pretty nice. Check it out. But only if it's on sale.",1
"The game is great, not short at all and it is fun to play online like Verus. But the thing is that when I spawn as an infected or a survivor, I can't move! I'm literally stuck and I can't do nothing but look around. I tested the local files and I validated the game twice and it did not work. Can I please get some help? I would really, really appreciate it. Other else than that the game is great.",1
"This is the MMORPG that gamers say they want. Deep story, total control over your character's appearance, interesting missions (quests), challenging, skill-based, etc.  The only thing I have to say to newcomers is that you need to forget what the typical MMO has taught you about zone progression. TSW has you progress from area to area within a zone, extending the amount of time you spend in a place, and it really helps connect you to that part of the world. Each region is made up of 2-3 full zones, and each zone has 6-10 areas within it that you will progress through.  Gamers have been complaining for years in other MMOs about throw-away zones that are forgettable. TSW addresses that, but the tradeoff is you're going to be spending more time in those zones.  Now, let me save you the 5,000 word essay I could (and would) write on Investigation Missions. They're the single best thing I've ever seen in an MMO. It's like National Treasure and Da Vinci Code had Rosemary's Baby... and it's GLORIOUS.  I can't believe a game this smart even got made.  The dungeons are rich and story-driven, and look spectacular, no generic hallways filled with scaled versions of normal mobs. These are hand-crafted and very memorable.   Raids/Nightmare mechanics give you a LOT to worry about, and will keep you on your toes. This is not Sinister Strike x3 &gt; Eviscerate raiding here. The mechanics are not very forgiving, and if you screw up there's a good chance you'll just be a smear on the floor.  TSW isn't afraid to remind you that while you have special abilities, you're not all-powerful :)  11/10  Note: Actual playtime is +200hrs or so, as I didn't initially own the game on Steam.",1

"If there is one game that can simultaneously make you want to break your PC and stay up into the wee hours of the night playing, this would be it right here. Still, I haven't yet figured out whether I enjoy the frustration of the game, or the sheer cleverness of the game paired with the immense gratitude of slaying giant beasts; nonetheless, this is an amzing game well worth playing ( and yelling at). Having quit halfway through due to madness, I came back and got addicted all over again and enough to make me think about buying the second one. Arrogance is surely not your friend in this game, and you will soon find that out when even the 'easiest' of enemies can hack away your health into the late game without close attention from the player. If you have the strength, endurance, and determination to get through this game, at the end there will be no regrets.",1
"Worst of its kind. I play and enjoy puzzle game including free to plays, this one is just bad.

"Wow...REALLY!!!!!! Im on a limited 120G gata plan and this Free game used up 1.8G... what a waste of Gigs. Having played many hunting games on Ps2 and ps3... this is by far the worst and unrealistic. You could Stalk Prey for 30 min to finally get a clear shot... but nothing happens because to hunt most animals you need a permit... which costs real money.. lots of money. Sloppy contols, and Flickering graphics make it hard to distinguish between Prey and poor graphic stability. If you are really, really, really, really bored and there is no other game on Any PS, Xbox, Atari or Comodore 64.. then i would recommend this Disaster. But until then...STAY AWAY",-1
This game is a box full of fun :D !,1
"Really good game, I finished the story mode getting S for the game within 17hrs and 30 minnutes and god damn I was very fustrated on some of them since the AI are stong xD, I really recommend this game if you have not already bought it Pros Amazing Graphics Sounds are like around you so it's like you're in the game Buying Art Many types of fights Eg normal fights, 4 bars fight Naruto run (temple run xD) and many more So many characters Costume (unfortunately no swimsuit girls :&lt;) Combo ulti's (So ccool)  Cons Bad frame rates only because this game is meant for xbox/ps  Unsyncronise voice (screw spelling) Personally I hate the trade system (those mini missions (use 3 techniques to get this item))  Funny Retrying everytime and trying to get a S....  Overall I love this game and I am impress as to how this game turn out, other reviews regarding bad comments about voice and framerate and what not, think about consoles and pc as to what the game naruto was originally made for.",1

"i wanted to like this game a lot, since im into the aesthetic and i love board-based puzzle games like this. but the game is too trial-and-error to be enjoyable, as you get deeper into the game there's certain puzzles where you don't feel like you learnt enough about the game to get you to that point. it seems like it's teaching you methods and patterns and then something completely different will turn up that'll take you 30 minutes to figure out. and the solution is rarely rewarding because you find yourself brute forcing it. i stopped finding it enjoyable at the point where i'd feel like I was just getting used to other puzzle games, so maybe it's just a pacing thing. everyone should play Hexcells.",-1
May be one of the aggravating games ever made. Definitely recommend to those with extremely short tempers.,1

2D platformer where you have to escape a sinking ship. The mechanics and settings are new and cool but the execution is bad. The levels are often unfair and you run into lots and lots of dead ends wich will discourage you very quickly. Also there is nearly no replayability value.,-1

awesome game! been playing for a few months now and i still love it. cant wait to see the final mmo when it gets there!,1

"A game worthy of the name finally after so many years. While it has been changed compared to the original. It still has the same feel, the same mood, the same ungrateful nations backing your XCOM project. Even on Normal setting you can get in so deep that you cannot fund your project and loose the game. Loosing a man on a mission is considered a good result after the mission. The game has an Ironman mode, couple that with a difficulty higher than normal and you can have an experience that rivals or is harder than the original game.  In conclusion, highly recommended for the fans of strategic turnbased combat.",1
"Highly recommended but be aware of what you are getting.  The game is designed like a pay to win game but you can actually play the full game without spending a dime. The energy bar is small and most game sessions you will only get 4 or 5 HOG scenes per play session consisting of about 10 to 20 minutes. However, part of the jackpot of some of your victories is a puzzle chest (about 8 varieties), and very little energy is needed to play those chests. Thus you can usually always end a play session playing a couple puzzle chest extending your play time. The chest themselves are for the most part challenging.  As far as the HOG scenes, the hidden objects are nicely illustrated and all but a couple are named correctly. (flute is misnamed and one object gets a name change 2/3 of the way thorugh, and one oject takes advantage of synonyms), interestingly, since this extended play game involves going to all the HOG scenes (about 15) multiple times it eventually morphs from a Hidden object game to a memory game. This is the only HOG I have ever played where I did not mind the timer clock. Eventually it became fun for me to beat the clock at the first stage, trying to remember all the hidden spaces. My guess is that an object will have about four hidey holes within an HOG scene. So its never a matter of replaying an HOG scene and going to the last hidey hole.  The music is excellent, the graphics are great, but the story telling is lame. The way they tried to tell the story did not work at all for me. It bascially felt like they tagged on a story after they created the game world. The story was totally uninvolving and I ususally just clicked through the text.  OTOH, the game achievments and game collections drove me to put dozens and dozens of hours into this game. If you are a completionist, this game will drive you like no other HOG. However, the designers negleted to put in about 4 game pieces so it is impossible to get 100 % on the game collection part.  I got a lot of hours and enjoyment out of this game and bought something for 2 bucks just as a nod to support the developers. I hope they build on this game and do another.",1
"A very emotional, beautiful and realistic representation of the life and death of a fly.  In this game, you are a fly. Your objective is to ascend to the heavens.",1
"There's a lot more to this game than meets the eye. Saying too much will spoil it.  I had really long string of runs even with my first life(s)/reign(s) which made my learning curve pretty fast but that definitely may not be the experience you have.  Great concept, well-executed.  Layered depth/replayability that will be addicting for some.  Solid purchase for its price.",1

"What a fun game. It's a remake of an older game from about 2011 called, you guessed it, The Binding of Isaac. It's a massive refurbishment to it's parent. Adding newer graphics, enemies, enemies, sound effects, music, etc. The addition of all these items of course adds a large amount of play time and difficulty. You can pour hours into this game and will still have a while longer to play (I mean, if you're a completionist.) Not to mention that this game adds in seperate accounts and save data, meaning if you need to get off of the application, you could just save and quit. This game does not skimp on secrets either. Loads of easter eggs, as far as the pixel-style, tear-chuckin' eye can see. Just, for the rooms that shape a crescent, bomb the middles of the wall nearest to the center. It's a seeeeecret. Of all the games I just play for fun, this one is high up in my list. This game is filled with replyability, content, and not to mention humor. The items you collect usually have clever, and crude humor alike. But, the jokes do tend to be a bit... controversial, and by that I mean it kind of pokes fun at christianity. Having all of the religous junk, it struck down it's possibility of bieng on the WiiU, it almost was, but Nintendo had to not have it cuza the religion stuff. I'm not one to complain, under it's kind of messed up texture it's a very fun, addictive game. I've got 69 hours on record and counting. If you're planning on buying, then get ready to ragequit your figurative pants off.",1
"Fantastic so far. Fans of the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution alike will love the level design, music, freedom of choice, and general gameplay. Feels MUCH more like the original Deus Ex than HR did, but better in almost every aspect.  Had no crashes or technical issues myself, running on: GTX 980 Ti | i7 6700K | 16GB DDR4 | SSD | Win10 | 2560x1440 - at roughly 50-70fps. MSAA off, due to severe lag. Temporal AA looks as good as 4xMSAA anyway.  + bigger, more detailed environments with tons of verticality and movement choice + great character designs and dialog + great graphics if you have the power to run it + lots of nods to the previous games, and character cameos + stealthy or action - it's up to you  - high hardware requirements. Some 1080's and 980 Ti's are struggling to maintain 60fps on Ultra - mild mouse accelleration - awkward menus clearly designed for controllers  The microtransactions and pre-order DLC are definitely a stupid and badly executed decision, but you can completely ignore them. I haven't seen them at all in my 10 hours of play; I only know about it due to Reddit and forum posts.  I'll update the review as I play more.",1
"Hacker evolution is NOT a hacking game, but more something like: You must dig into the servers to find new servers, clues and other things that will help you. Something between exploration and detective. This game is more about thinking ahead. Stats like trace will be carried with you to the next level, so if you finish a level with 99% trace, it will be the same in next level. For people who like to play easy games this game is really frustrating, but for those which like challenges this is a perfect game.  Pros: + Great Soundtrack + Good Concept + Great UI (BUT it will not fit everyone) + Lots of fun if you like challenges + Great Story  Cons: - Hardcore for some players (you have to restart whole game if you screw something up)",1

What a bunch of Bulls was having fun during the few hours i played so far until they made it crappy ubisoft you disgust me,-1
"Behold ! As trailer or press showcase this game, this not a point and click, nor and adventure game !   It is a reflexion/management/puzzle game. Where you have to manage risk between time and safety. Each level come with different rules and rounds (some rounds also have different rules within the level).  You have to read, learn and think (sometime I had to use a notepad to keep note) and act in this nice game.  It's like a great poker game with a fancy storyline. ",1
You only bought this for DayZ,1
"In my experience, the game has too much loading in it, the servers are either full or empty and it is extremely noob unfriendly ( there is always one guy on one team or the other that knows the game and kicks ♥♥♥ and the game is just not fun.)",-1

"It's an awesome game. If you like to do missions with friends or even random people in a huge open world, this is a game for you. (The main story mission requires solo) If you like to solo, you can totally do almost everything by yourself. This game plays like a single player game in a MMO world. The PVP zone is very interesting. Three alliances fight each other, capture bases and resources. It's like a massive war. Well, it is a war. Join the fight, you will enjoy it!",1
"Simple, beautiful and all around fun. Easy to learn mechanics that is surprisingly challenging (especially if you are going for the achievements), and solid sound/art design. More than once, I found myself in an almost trance like state just watching to see how long I can stay in orbit rather than progressing to the next level.   I highly recommend you purchasing this game.",1
"So last night before I went to bed, I pre-loaded this game thinking that I would have an awesome new co-op game to play with my roommate (on top of the Saints Row expansion). I woke up, fired up the game, and played for a little more than half an hour.  Though my initial reaction was somewhat a bit more positive, it slowly went the other direction as I played through the beginning sequence and then took a jump off a (metaphorical) cliff as soon as I began noticing FPS hitches/skips (whatever the heck you wanna call it). Normally something like this wouldn't really bother me. I would simply wait for it to be patched (a game-ready driver update from Nvidia, just like every other game, would be nice too), and then I can play it to my heart's content.  I decided to check the reviews to see if anyone else was experiencing any or all of the same problems, as it turns out, some had it worse than I did! But the 'nail that sealed the coffin' for me was when I learned that not only was the co-op not included in the initial release (except for the consoles), but the campaign which originally was advertised as a co-op campaign (like RE6) won't be included at all! WTF!?  It makes no sense that a previous entry like RE6 gets the offline co-op treatment (fyi, it was well implemented), but this game doesn't. Why Capcom? Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea?  I will keep my verdict of this crappy port until the following things are fixed:  -FPS issues resolved -Co-op included in both offline and online play (for BOTH campaign and Raid mode) -Game is sold AS ADVERTISED!  EDIT: I've seen some reviews earlier saying that the FPS issue is only a problem if you have a less than favorable PC. So just to ensure that it is simply the game and not my hardware configuration (unless there is something I am unaware of), I'm going to add system specs.  Gigabyte AMD FM2 A85X ATX Motherboard GA-F2A85X-UP4 AMD A-8 6600K Quad Core Processor @ 4.5 GHz Corsair H55 Liquid Cooled CPU Cooler Corsair Vengeance 8 GB (2x4) DDR3 RAM @ 1600 MHz EVGA GTX 760 FTW Edition 4 GB  Samsung EVO 840 120 GB SSD WD Green 2 TB HDD WD Blue 500 GB HDD Cooler Master V650 650W PSU   EDIT: So I finally decided to revisit this game to see if Capcom has done anything to fix this game, and is it turns out, they have. As far as I know, the offline split-screen co-op function is now implemented (like it always should have been), and the FPS issues SHOULD be fixed... but I'm going to need to play the game to see if it performs any better than it did at launch.   NOTE: I don't know if the split-screen co-op only works with two gamepads (I've been experimenting) or if there is a way to use a combo of gamepad/KBM since I prefer the PC controls. Will update in near future to give the final verdict.",-1

Pure Star Wars Prefection. Anyone who is a fan of the expanded universe or star wars in general get this game its one of the best star wars games out there! =D,1

Very good game for Free to Play. Takes a lot of cooperation and coordination from teammates to be successful in game.,1
great game!couldnt stop playing!! ,1
One of the best games out there on Steam.,1
Multiplayer is infested with hackers. Rockstar isn't doing enough to stop them. I'll take my negative review down when this issue has been resolved.,-1
"Highly recommended game. It is very enjoyable. Perhaps the only bad part of this game is the limited community. On a server with a good number of bots and a good number of players, the games are truly memorable.  For someone who has no idea what this is, you are on a ship. You have someone you are trying to find and kill, while someone is trying to find and kill you. You get penalized for killing people not your target, and you need to dodge around police, cameras, and the like to try and find weaponry and your target. Truly amazing. Clue with Guns.",1
One of the most beautiful racing games I've ever played. I've played nearly all of codemasters racing games through the Collin McRae Rally series to the Dirt series. Online is ok but could be improved. Only thing I dislike is the DLC aspect of the game.,1
"Just an opinion, but this is the least fun I've ever had with a game I've tried this hard to get into. In 14 hours I have not been able to complete a single objective of a single mission, despite spending enough time mindlessly jumping between systems exploring to afford to buy a new ship. The mining system is clunky and annoying, plus you have the super fun experience of having to run from pirates constantly because your ship is not outfitted for combat.   I really wanted to like this game. It's on epic scale and the visuals are nice.  The gameplay is so insanely impossible to approach I've spent hours just wondering where I can even go to do anything.   This game is frustrating, seemingly empty of content until you've spent countless hours building up to the point that you can even access it, and it seems like every time you turn around you find out that it's a huge pain to get what you need to do some crucial part of the game that you had no idea you needed until you've jumped halfway across the spiral arm to get to the objective that you then can't even start to complete.  I regret every single moment and cent I've put into this game. 0/10 Take it from a dota2 player, this game's learning curve is stupid.",-1
"Very stupid game! I am sorry that i payed n euro cents for it. I want to return my money. I have ultra lag on low.. my CS:GO is good but this game isn't running smooth. I feel very sad playing this game. It reminds me of Ukraine, which i hate it in my hearth. I love Russia. Be ruski. Could someone return the money for me? This game itself calculated 5 hours of gameplay. And i live in a crime country?",-1
"This game is awesome! WWII, Explosions, American and Nazi Dinosaurs!   Actually, this does a very nice job of balancing dinosaurs, weapons, and teams. There is no D-Day map so 'Dino D-Day' seems like a pretty random name.  A campaign would be nice but whatever, the multiplayer is very fluid and balanced. Really nice.  10/10, would Nazi Dino again :D",1
Everyone who is giving it bad reviews are little ♥♥♥♥♥es cause they didn't liek their free toy ;),1
"Compared to the past 2 games which were more horror than shooter this game is different. I consider this one more of a shooter than a horror game. If you are interested in a shooter, deff. buy this one, if you are interested in a horror game, look in the past 2 games...",1
  TLDR - GO BUY THIS GAME. ONE OF THE BEST INDIE GAMES OUT THERE!!!!,1
"This is a worthy sucessor of Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. It improves on it and is currently the best competitor of Mario Kart. It may be a little inferior to the Nintendo kart racing, but it's still an awesome game for this genre. Plus, Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed isn't a Nintendo exclusive. Like the title implies, this time around you race in 3 vehicle types: car, boat and plane. And you'll frequently change between these vehicles during the same race. The car plays almost the same as the original title, which focuses on gaining extra speed through drifting and boosting. The car is stable and easy to control. You can also drift and boost on boats and planes, but the boat sections are more focused on hitting ramps to perform stunts to earn boosts and the plane sections are more focused on hitting boost panels in a more straight line, while also evading the course obstacles to get extra boosts. The boat is harder to maneuver because of the water waves and because it's harder to turn. The plane is more straightforward, with the added verticality to control. But sometimes it can be a little stiff, especially during sharp turns. But overall, the vehicle switch mechanic is fluid and the physics are great for all of them. The carrer mode is essentially the same as the previous title. World tour to me felt like the original mission mode, but more organized with added unlockables. Gran prix is just that, a series of 4 races awarding points in each race based on the final position. But this time you can't restart in the middle of it, and that's how it should be to me. Time trials are the same, but this time with added leaderboards. And of course, there's single race. The game is also way harder than the original, and the expert difficulty is hard, with some events being very hard, like some of the time trial ghosts. But it's doable with some practice, and as you play and experiment you'll get better. There's also online mode, which isn't quite dead yet, but i didn't spent much time on it. The character and track selection is also better than the original. While some characters were removed, there's plenty of new ones. Some are from the same game as others, some from other SEGA titles, some 3rd party ones (e.g. Team Fortress), and even a real life rally racer that here drives a Hot-Wheels on land. The selection feels better and more diverse, even with the removed characters. The tracks are also cooler. There's only 16 tracks (not counting 4 returning ones), but they are more diverse, longer and change mid-race, so the 3 laps aren't always the same. Added with the vehicle switch and good design for the most part, these tracks are a blast to play on. They are also beautiful as well as the graphics, a real eye candy. The soundtrack is also cool. This time the tracks are arrangements instead to ripped songs, and they work pretty well (i love the Golden Axe arrangement on Adder's Lair, as well as this course). If you like kart racing games, this is an easy recommendation, even if you think that you may like it. It may take some time for beginners to get good, but it's definitely worth it.",1
"Had this game for the last week or so, have dumped 14+ hours into it so far, which means it's time for me to stop being lazy and write a well-deserved review.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  This game plays similarly to the Don't Starve franchise, if you've ever played that or watched someone play it, but is vitally different in a lot of aspects. You play as Flux, a purple suit of armor with no thumbs and an infinite inventory that manages itself. Along with your trusty robot companion, you are plopped onto a foreign world via spaceship crash, and it's your job to survive, re-ascertain contact with the company you work for, and eventually get home (I think, if you have one). The game is sort of a 2D sidescrollerish game, but the world is completely open, filled with lots of little things for you to loot, kill, and ultimately upgrade your housing, weapons, gear, and crafting stations. There are literally HUNDREDS of items to harvest and collect and craft. Combat takes some accurate timing and getting used to, but it's loads of fun.   PROS:  -Nice graphics, very nice art style -Fun combat -TONS of things to collect and craft -Infinite, self-managing inventory -Tools that equip themselves only when you need them, and disappear when you dont so they're not in the way -Lots of content -Building stuff, in addition to the aforementioned crafting -Lots of different enemmies with varying attacks and variations of the species -Pets made from killed enemies that help you in combat with active attacks and passive buffs -Great music -Addicting -Cross platform saving with mobile -No permadeath, if you die you can just walk to your gravemarker and pick up the stuff you lost -Teleports all over the map for fast travel  CONS:  -I wish it wasn't such a pain to navigate between sections of the world like the Savanna and Bawg and then get back to your original house without making another one. -I'm honestly trying so hard to find flaws - but godamn I love this game.   TL;DR:  This game only costs $15, and if I had known how much I would enjoy it, I would have paid $40. It's amazingly fun, with humorous dialogues, fun gameplay, and very intuitive crafting and item collection/use. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, even if you're new to games of this type. I wasn't a huge fan of Don't Starve, but I love this game. I wish I could high-five the devs and buy them beer.   Easily 9/10.",1
Something you should play - it's awesome - but it's been showing age for years.   RCT World is theoretically around the corner...,1
This is a realistic game that provides players with a challenging and awsome gameplay. I highly recommend it to those who loved adventure games. Three stars :D,1
The game quickly gets boring and repetitive even when playing with freinds.,-1
i had this game in the old greatest hits pack so i actually have way more hours than what you see up above. this game is cited as one of the best rpgs ever and not jus star wars rpg but all rpgs. go into the game with open eyes. the graphics are dated but the gameplay is definitly not. with the new content unlocked for kotor 2 this game has a fresh leash on life. play this game first because kotor 2 is full of kotor spoilers,1
If you want to have fun and drive seriously at the same time this game is made for you.,1

"About Rocket League...  It is a boring game and absolutely NO FUN, especially the fact i only played 516 hours i think my statement is very solid!  Just kidding, this game is absolutely addicting and i suggest not to listen to those people that dont like this game because of 'technical difficulties'   Yes, ranking system points is a bit meh, but they are still tweeking on that and improved already overall. But when you are playing a with a group of mates or a random group that can work together, the satisfaction is mandatory when scoring a goal or doing the assist!   Every assist or goal still gives me absolute satisfaction.  Long story short, fantastic game, addiction and cheap DLC's make this an awesome game with soon 'extra mods' :D",1
"Summary: Beautiful, LINEAR game, with no motivation to pvp, and an end game consisting of repeating the same 7 missions over and over again.   The first few hours of this game are exciting and fun. The gunplay is decent and the world is beautiful. But then it turns into a cookie cutter mmo lvling system, and the only end game is a constant marathon loop to gain crafting mats.  This game is not open world, yes you can go wherever whenever but once you pass that zones level, theres no point to return unless you want to run around grabbing mats....yes the npcs scale to yoo to be more difficult but they are still always a few lvls below you.  Theres no reason to pvp. The motivation to pvp is non existant. It was advertised that we would pvp over loot but most drops are garbage and you cannot see if anyone has anything of value worth the potential lvl lose to kill them over.  End game is running the same 7 missions over and over again to grind better gear just to make the grind easier.   With incursions coming it will only further narrow the games content because we will possibly get 3 incursions but prob only one. And the best gear will be in the incursion, in effect causing any other action in the game to be pointless in furthering your advancement. Noone will go to the darkzone for gear and noone will pvp, not that anyone does now anyway.  P.s. glitches, exploits and bugs, oh my! But at least this is a sexy looking piece of .....",-1
"no No NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. While I accept this game is in beta, it's currently so utterly sh*t that I don't reccomend getting it until it moves to a later stage.

It used to be good (hate to be that guy), you see this game is driven by it's community, inb4 it was fun tbh, you could find a server and cooperatively build something (obviously that might have not happened because of all the mingebags).

" Short:[\h1] For me, this game is a must buy. Watching one of my characters, Chuck Norris, blow up an enemy to pieces just with a punch is an enormous satisfaction.   Short:[\h1] This game is a little gem, I reccomend it both to fans of the genre and to those who are not familiar with tactical CRPG and are willing to cope with the initially steep learning curve. It is a CRPG that manages to distuinguish itself from the mass thanks to its story, setting and gameplay.  First off, this is not your usual fantasy tactical RPG with mages and warriors. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, reminiscent of Fallout, populated by different factions, mutated animals and all sorts of crazy. The plot (which I am not going to reveal here) might be a little too clichey, but it is interesting nonetheless and it is supported by solid characters.  I truly enjoyed the artwork, visuals and audio of the game. Even though this is not a big budget game the result is very pleasant, aesthetically speaking.   The best part for me was the gameplay. I was impressed by the system of skills and perks and the way it allows to customize your characters. Now, regarding the character creation, I must admit that this is a little frustrating at first. The problem is that you are presented with a vast number of skills and little information of 1) what they really do and 2) which ones are essential and which ones are superfluous. The result of this is that my first team of rangers was very ineffective and I had to drop it after a few hours in the game. With the experience gained in those few hours I could then create a new set of characters that were not only a powerhouse but also reflected better the picture of the team that I had in my mind. Despite this problem, I don't regret going through the character creation phase a couple of times, because this is one of the most addictive parts. Not only you can assign the skills, but also customize the appearence of the characters and even give them background stories.  Another positive of this game is that, even though the plot is linear, in certain key moments you get to take decisions (for example wheter to side with a faction or another) that affect the story and reinforce the feeling of immersion.   Now, to the negatives. The biggest problem of this game is that it seems unpolished and unfinished. My feeling is that the developers could not stretch their budget further and had to cut the story short and remove some features. For example, I was disappointed by the second leg of the story: after the first part of the game was rich of locations and events, the second part goes so fast that left me with a sensation of incompleteness and wondering 'is it already over?'. The same thing goes for the overall presentation of the games (like I said earlier, explanations of the skills, etc.).  My overall opinion is that the positives largely outweigh the negatives and this game, even though it is not the great game it could have been, is a lot of fun to play.",1
"I cannot recommend this game if, like me, you are playing on a PC with a left-handed mouse, and tend to remap key bindings from WSAD configuration to something else. The game DOES support using the cursor keys to control your character, but DOES NOT support remapping any of the other keys. The need to combine the space key for jumping with camera control by left-handed mouse and cursor keys for movement is so awkward that this game becomes unplayable, considering that it requires very precise jumping.  Too bad, because I was really interested in experiencing this game's story.  I really do not understand why developers are willing to spend so much time on developing a game and then do not allow key remapping, which is quite easy to implement. Effectively, they are shutting out about 10% of their player base.",-1

I recommend my friends to activate the 'Wild Wasteland' perk as some of the benefits are quite handy. I still prefer F3 to F:NV but the difference is negligable - Perhaps it is the Factions war that links a lot of the stories together; a handy device that unfortunately makes many experiences seem contrived. The freedom to explore a virtual frontier makes up for being given the duty of running errands for crazed militarists. F3 and F:NV have taken the 'crappy gun makes for more fun' formula to the next level but this leads to micromanagement and an overextended lesson in economics. There are cool guns out there but they are often hard to find and risky to get ('Vengance' for example).   After finishing the last DLC 'Lonesome road' the experience was so impressive I heartily recommend this game ('Old world Blues' DLC also)",1
"Unbalanced in the skill/random chance element. You could 'risk manage' the best you can, and then... four 20s, all of which do 2 damage to your ship, plus whatever niggles (Usually system failures) you've left behind. Shame, because it's pretty... But whats under the hood was put together seemingly without sufficient consideration for how everything *interacts*. A good example would be how rarely you actually get to *use* your research and abilities, because... Well, that crisis is going to keep going until you get rid of it, and more crises are on the way, and at least one of the crises, during a run, is nigh guaranteed to only be solvable *if* you can not only get all your crew to where it is, but also if they roll high, and high rolls aren't considered a bad thing, and -  And, and, and, and... Or more accurately 'But, but, but, but-' is pretty much the story. You would have gotten past week three this run, if 2s hadn't been a void... But you could have tried to reshuffle for that research somewhere else that stops voids, but you needed to get the health up to survive the event you couldn't possibly stop this turn even with lucky rolls... But the doctor rolled nothing higher than a 3 this turn...  That's 90% of Tharsis runthroughs in a nutshell. You can generally see you're going to lose early, but that, in turn, leads to restarts after only a minute or two of play, and... Well, if you like rolling dice to see if you win, over and over again, sure... But the problem is, in the end? That's what it boils down to.",-1
Fantastic game. Extremely well balanced with just enough randomization. I highly recommend it.,1
"I love this game! It has a great story, and amazing atmosphere. It really makes you think about hat your going to do before doing it. If you like games like Life is strange, or story rich games, i cannot recomened this enough! The beginning might be alittle slow, but it picks up really fast. Please give this game a try if you have even the slighest intrest in it.",1
"My friends and I spent an evening playing Damned and it was absolutely worth the money. I think you will enjoy this game if you aren't expecting AAA polish and are interested in having a lot of fun getting into your role as either the monster or one of the survivors. This game relies a lot on the monster to create a fun experience for the survivors. It's so important to mess with people before you kill them. If you are having a bad experience that isn't related to bugs, try playing with friends on a private server, it is a lot of fun.    ",1
"At this moment in time, I could not recommend this game. The game stutters and freezes non stop making it almost unplayable. And before you say 'It's probably your computer', it isn't. I can run most games on max settings with 60fps. Most games being things like GTA 5, Star Wars battlefront EA etc. My computer comes way above the recommended specs. It's just unplayable.  The gameplay... well it could be fun but the constant freezing and stuttering ruins it. The exploration mode ,in my opinion, is terrible. It takes lots of unneeded effort to cause the ship to sink, and when it sinks, it will sink in 4-5 minutes and won't actually sink properly - it doesn't crack in half.  I haven't tried the escape mode yet and i'm not sure I will until the game is finished. The reason being that the stuttering just makes this unplayable to me.   For now, I would give this a 5/10. It's worth it for the price, but you likely won't spend too much time on it until it's finished.  And yes, I do realise that the game is still in development. That's why I didn't give it a 4. I think that this game has a chance in becoming a good game.",-1
Sheltered being a fun game i would recommend it because i have always enjoyed survival games and that combined with the pixel style art it will one day become and amazing game with it being 1 year old and many updates to come i recommend this game,1
"i find that the controls are horrible on this game. Personally i would definetly have full remote support on this game.  on the mission demolition Man trying to fly a helicopter hoa the most stupid, horrible, usuless control layout at times ime finding when flying the heli not responsive at times. i only bought the game for memorobilia.   Great game but steam put full control support its usuless with keyboard and mouse",-1
  this game is really fun to play and i love how easy it is to know it. its quite easy to master the game.,1
"How they managed to take one of the best-performing ports of last-gen and turn it into this, I'll never understand.  If you rely on integrated graphics like I do, this game is simply unplayable because of the constant slowdown. Mind you, I've clocked nearly 100 hours in the vanilla version between an old laptop and an off-the-shelf desktop, and I've never had a problem getting it to run at 60 fps. I don't see how the additions in this version warrant such a performance drop.  If you have decent specs then it might work just fine, and I would highly recommend this title to anyone who missed out on the original DMC4 if only to experience the base content. But understand that this version's performance is completely unacceptable.  That said, even the content they added is somewhat unpolished. You'll still be playing through the same levels from the vanilla version. You can even see in the official previews that the new characters were implemented with a complete lack of effort beyond their gameplay. Notice how each time an enemy mob is activated, there's a short cutscene where the camera pans around a bunch of static character models. Where in Dante/Nero scenarios the enemies might at least have some spawning animations, with the new characters it looks like the scene was hastily thrown together in the engine as if it was an alpha build.",-1
The real online fps experience right here,1
Death rally is a classic type of game.,1
"An okay adventure game, the best parts were the beautiful art and the charming dialogue. Some of the puzzles were incrediblyannoying and the second act was full of them with lots of backtracking on top, I could have done without that. For how cheap you can find it now this game is great, perfect for kids, though they might get pretty frustrated. The ending was a non-ending which was very annoying.",1

just one word to describe this game 'AWESOME' get it,1
Actually one of the best Total War games- Rome 2 and Attila is complete ♥♥♥♥ comparable to this masterpiece.,1
"As the game begins, we find our depressed, bitter, and cynical protagonist Susan Ashworth on the floor of her flat. Susan has just downed 34 sleeping pills in an attempt to end her life and she passes from the world but is plucked from the brink of death by a supernatural being who tasks her with finding and killing 5 individuals who thrive on the pain and suffering of others. Susan finds out that she has a crucial advantage over these 'parasites,' as the narrative calls them: she cannot die. In fact, throughout the game Susan will be maimed and killed in brutal ways but shortly comes back to life, unscathed. You might think that this takes away from the game's tension, but it only adds to the atmosphere. Susan's life is a living hell, partially of her own creation, and she has no escape from it.  The game deals with some pretty heavy issues such as depression, suicide, substance abuse, and many other typical 'adult fears.' Although it has several moments that are borderline or full-blown jump scares, most of the horror comes from what the game puts right in front of you, plain to see. The game runs at a low resolution and the character animations are somewhat jerky, but part of me believes that this was an aesthetic choice and the game works beautifully even with said limitations. The narrative is excellent, if short (I finished in 7.5 hours) and even manages to be somewhat uplifting when all is said and done. I'd recommend it to any fans of classic adventure games or fans of horror in general. It's one of those low-profile gems that is a rarity in modern gaming. It will stick with you LONG after you stop playing.",1
"The visuals are vibrant and intricate. I love how the terrain crumbles around you and lights flash everywhere. I love how this game doesn't suffer from the disease of most modern games being way too brown, but damn this Dante guy is so ♥♥♥♥ing extra.",1
"Recommended as long as you know what you're getting yourself into.  There's not much 'gameplay' here. You walk around from location to location finding things, picking up things, completing tasks etc. all while having very human-like conversations with your female supervisor (Delilah) via walkie-talkie. Lots of walking, lots of lovely scenery to discover and sometimes interact with.  As time passes, you become embroiled in a set of increasingly weird goings-on, as your friendship with your Delilah deepens.  Then it ends. Pretty quickly too, because Firewatch is a SHORT game. I finished it in about 4 hours. People criticise the ending, and I can understand why, but it is actually pretty true to real life and not 'gamey' at all.  You play this for the story and the experience. There is no action whatsoever. Make up your mind and decide if that's ok for you, and consider the price you're currently paying.  Or watch it all on YouTube. ",1
"I personally, prefer thrid person games, for it seems more engaging. Being able to move the camera around, and looking over the shoulder of the protagonist is one of the key things I look for when I look for a game. I know, it's a stupid thing to notice when choosing, but I genuienly shy away from games of other angles. Transistor, as an honest opinion, seemed boring at first. It was oddly flashy, and the gameplay was too simple. It seemed too grindy, most of the puzzles repeated one another. Besides the flash, and the art, the game itself seemed bland.     However,   the simple gameplay is not bland. The puzzles are widely different. The art style is amazing. Instead of being heavily dependent on gameplay, action, and hacking your way through a hoard of monsters, the game is semi-turn base, yet, filled with great puzzles that underline the action. The plot is beautifully written, and the world is   not   cliche.  Seriously, check it out.",1
"Love the game, but as others have said this version iis a turkey. Lazy DOS box shell that crashes when you try to alt-tab or window out of the map. No ability to speed up game or adjust resolution. And of course it's the ugly as hell Dos version of the game.  Oh and all the bugs that have ever been in this game are still there.  I've played this game in 4 different versions (mac, windows,  gog.com  version, this) and this is the weakest version by a mile.",-1
0/10 You have to create an account in rockstar and windows live to play,-1
"For starters, it's an entertaining little puzzle game. Simple to understand, but gets more difficult with time. Also, the price is right, as it is a fairly short game. For just £1, you get to entertain yourself for just over an hour. Money well spent.",1
"This game is hilarious! ...oh, and the poker is really fun too! but honestly, its so fun listening to the characters talk that you dont even care if you loose!",1
"good game,, not great multi monitor support though,,, u need something likw flawless widescreen to fix the streaching issues and hud,, but all in all good game",1
Great game - definitly an improvement over EU,1
"By far, one of my favorite games. Planetbase demonstrates the delicate balance of an artificial ecosystem, and emphasizes the importance of planning ahead by hoarding resources long before you need them. Graphics are excellent, UI is intuitive, the gameplay is fun and I have gladly wasted hours trying to 'crack the code', as it were. Well worth your greenbacks.",1

"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this game, but after playing it, being stuck to it from start to finish of the campaign; I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this. The ups and downs between overabundance and running on empty had me tense as to what was I was going to find, and luckily simple enough not to need a 50 page manual to play the damn thing.  I also liked the little thank you at the end. The Molasses Flood, thank YOU for this great little experience :)",1

"Sandbox adventure. Loads of content. Yoyos. Weapon Classes. Bosses. Rougelike. Metroidvania. Nostalgic. Potions. Fishing and quests systems. Accesories. Buffs and debuffs. Farming. NPCS and shops. Wings. Mounts. Grapple hooks. Expert mode. A lot of ways to die.   There are too many good things to fit in this review, but I can say one thing.  You should buy Terraria.",1

Just let me sum it up real quick: If you desire a more complex moba than Heroes of the Storm or League of Legends, you may give DotA 2 a shot.

"The story is damn sick! I was about to stop playing it in the middle of the first chapter, but then it got better and more interesting. I liked the character progression and the fact that I had to take tough decisions. The gameplay is fine, but not very challenging even on the hard difficulty. Overall, not a bad game, but the Witcher is cheaper, more challenging and has a lot more content.",1
"the singleplayer mode on this, allthough scripted and rather linear, doesn't really feel that way when you actually play out each mission. Singleplayer alone has actual replay value; not to mention the Multiplayer modes, both normal and zombie!",1

Terraria is probably the best lunch-priced game you could ever buy.,1
"A great game IMO, the super powers are fun, the story is exciting, the super takedowns are hilarious. Get this game and I'm sure you won't regret it... You might think it's weird and a huge change from the other Saints Rows (2,3 etc.) but you still will definitely not regret it.",1
"This is really more of a sandbox style action game than an open world title, but it offers some of the best unscripted set pieces in any game of the 7th console generation.  I normally frown upon sequels that change too much from the originals, but this concept of physics based destruction in a semi-open world is too brilliant for me to fault.  Sure would be nice if the weapons felt as good as the original game's did though. Cool gun noises for even the lamest guns seem to have been replaced by cool guns with lame noises.",1

Multiplayer is kinda dead, but, if you searching for good single player game of this type like I said, go buy this game NOW, and put that cookie DOWN, NOW!  420/69",1
"i do like the game...in fact i love it but i cant recomend it to anyone because of the many bugs in the game that makes it really frustrating i'm not gonna enter in details, the only things u need to know are that there are lots of bugs, things completely unbalanced and the lack of commitment from the devs (i usually participate in the community and it doesn't look like they are worried about the problems in the game). the game is abandoned",-1

I really wanted to play that game, but nada. At the moment I push on the play icone ith my mouse, it says that I have to update Direct X in order to play the game. I do it and nothing's changed. I have to do it all over again.   I really wanted to play Warrare Big Time guys. I would really apprecciate it if someone had a similar problem and could give me an Advice to help me making work this Game.  Stevick",1

"Rome: Total War is the Third game in the Total War series, released in 2004. Being 11-years old, as well as having several newer titles in the Total War series, Rome: Total War considerably shows it's age; However, with that being said it is still a fun, interesting game in the overall series. The game takes place prior to the middle ages, After the fall of the Roman Republic, during the Early Roman Empire. As is typical with the Total War series, You start off with a small number of player factions to choose, in this case 3, and unlock additional factions as playable once you conquer them.  Also as is typical of a Total War game, gameplay is divided between the real-time battles when in combat, and the turn-based actions of exploration, nation-building, and diplomacy. Rome: Total War has been consistently rated as one of the highest games throughout the Total War Series, based on IGN, Metacritic, and GameRankings, and has a large following, as well as many player-made mods. Despite it's age, Rome: Total War is a strategy game any fan of the Total War series should have.",1

Jumpscares will still surprise you and will have you always to be on your toes, carefully traversing the coridors expecting something might jump on you anytime soon. Overall, I've had an enjoyable experience.",1
"10 out of 10  its a super fun game with a good story i just recently got this and have enjoyed playing every part so far i would recomend this game to anyone who likes playing adventure, open world, story games!",1
"Genuinely, this game is fantastic. the physics engine is weird enough that you can still be surprised sometimes but no longer buggy enough that its frustrating. with the improvement of the object limit, we're now able to have massive battles that can be genuinely harrowing at times. I have had moments where I've been winning a battle by a landslide and they send in troops that absolutely wreck me. I'd then push foreword and get pushed back again and again. the difficulty slider being seperate from the A.I. intelligence slider is also incredibly fun. You can set the enemies to be bullet sponges, sure, but you can also get them to be intelligent and capable of taking you down. the campaign mode is fun at the higher difficulties, but I do feel that some more content and game modes would be fun. All in all, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it. 11/10 it has eaten my life.  Also, I recommend modding this game. Although do be sure to uninstall the mods you don't want and then check to make sure they're gone in the games files, as sometimes steam won't remove them properly and the game gets clogged at start up from tons of files you're not using.",1
Game is awesome. Simple as. So much to do. So beautiful. An insta-purchase that will keep me busy for many hours to come.,1
"  I'm going to write this review about an aspect most people don't seem to care about.  This game's achievements are a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.   As I did in BioShock Remastered, I started my run going for all the necessary diaries, weapon upgrades and research bonuses.  I should mention that I had no problems whatsoever 100%ing the remaster of the first game.  However, this one is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.  First of all: The achievements I was going for did not unlock in the process even after meeting all requirements. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off really bad since I invested more than 10 hours playing the game and watching a guide just to unlock these two achievements.  Secondly: Achievements, I should not have been able to unlock on my first playthrough unlocked anyway.   It baffles me all the more that the BioShock remaster was seemingly flawless. I had no problems playing that game at all. Like, how could the devs ♥♥♥♥ up that bad on such a seemingly simple thing as properly coding the achievements?  Other than that: • The game crashed on me almost every time I fought a Big Daddy and at seemingly random times. • The framerates were stable at around 150 FPS whilst running on a GTX 970. • There is no option to expand the FOV like in BioShock Remastered, which lead to me experiencing motion sickness at times.",-1
"Sorry, The Last of Us. I think I have a new favourite game for 2013...",1
"Ricochet would be Valve's most obscure game not called  Deathmatch Classic  if it didn't become a minor meme exactly for being Valve's most obscure game that isn't Deathmatch Classic. It's essentially a first person Tron mod for Half-Life where you run around platforms and throw discs at enemies to try and knock them off into the void.  I...guess the gameplay is okay for what it is? I wouldn't exactly know, because despite its meme status very few people actually play this game - and there are no bots. You can arrange pick-up games with some likeminded folks on the game's community forum, but that's it.  If you do own it, it's probably because you're a Valve nerd who bought the Complete Pack, a dyed-in-the-wool retro gamer who bought the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology which has this game for some reason, or a memelord. I don't know if it's even worth it for anybody else, unless you know other people who not only own but want to play it. This is yet another game that I'd like to give a 'mixed' rating to, and there's even a mixed icon on the Steam store's search results to display a game with middling user reviews! Come on Valve, show some initiative again.  Interesting to note that the 'variety of futuristic battle arenas' touted on the store page boils down to 3 maps that look the same, although given the nature of gameplay they seem to be designed alright. Also, props to the death screams and total lack of music or ambient noise for making the game a little creepy when nobody else is playing it.",1
Economical yet addictive game play! Breach &amp; Clear is a fantastic game combining the likes of Rainbow Six with ellements of CoD and Battlefield. Give it a go and you'll be hooked!,1

"There's a lot of customization, so if you're dedicated enough, you can create almost anything or anyone. (With some limits of course) The game goes on for eternity, and when you toss in all the DLC and/or custom content to this life simulation stew, it's almost impossible to get bored with. Of course there's the bugs, and sometime the game can run kinda badly (depending on how great your computer is) but those are usually fixable. It's wellmade with an overwhelming bundle of stuff and fun additions... if you're willing to pay the same price of the game for DLC. Basically, it's fun and you can get really creative; well worth 20-30 bucks.",1
"So far I am impressed with No Man's Sky. Its everything I expected it to be and has the type of grinding system I enjoy. It has a pleasant pace, music and scenery. Rather nice to play a game that's not 'stressful'.  As for all the bad rep, I don't quite understand what people expected.. It was released just as it was advertised. It can only get better from here, to get worse it would literally require all the devs to quit. The potential this game has is amazing, they can take it into so much depth that I am excited to see how it goes in the future.  8/8 m8s, stop with the h8",1

"oddworld abe's oddysee is one of the greatest games ever created on the PS1 console. the cut scenes are amazing (even for the 90's these are pretty high class videos)  GAMEPLAY- this games plays really well, the controls are amazing on keyboard, albeit a tad confusing. BUT not to worry, if you have a playstation game pad for the PC you can hook it up and play this game to your hearts content ... well ... you could do it already if you have a keyboard, but this game is made with a controller in mind so it would only improve on this already fantastic game.  not to mention how you save game, just pause and save and you're done ... come back when you've decided you won't rage quit over how challenging the game is ... forgot to mention that actually. This game is incredibly unforgiving. one wrong move and 'BOOM' ... you're blue paste gets splattered all over the screen, and you're left to think about what would happen to your green comrades if you could not re-spawn ... a banjo kazooie 'quit game ending if you will.  it doesn't do that, i'm just saying thinking about it is weird ... what if they all get eaten and they sell your organs for dog food, humanity goes into a downward spiral as events you couldn't stop, happen. The sequels always end with the sad ending, and you're no where to be seen because you died 2 games ago, nobody even knows your name anymore. As a slag (animal) begins to munch on your tinned mudoken fingers and eyeballs, the last sentient part of you is converted into fecal matter and your race DIES ... all because you took one step to the right and got crushed by a barrel of meat ... but i digress  STORY- the story to this game is essentially one giant Eco friendly metaphor for our own industrial prowess ... but it is so subtle/just plain ignorable that it will not rest on your conscience at all. basically you're an actual 'skrub' worker in the biggest meat factory on odd-world, your bosses want to kill and sell your race to (possibly) unwary, cannibalistic consumers (it's never specified who actually buys all this food). you get found out, chase scene happens, voodoo hoodoo guy with funny mask gives you powers, and you basically take off from there. the story is a lot more in-depth than that but, meh. it would spoil a lot of the lot to go into full detail (I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, THE PURCHASER OF THIS FINE PRODUCT! DON'T HATE ME!)  GRAPHICS- It's a ps1 game, so you can expect some ... aging, to take place. it's a side scroller from the 90's so its 32 bit graphic style will always hold up pretty well (if you're a forgiving sort of person who enjoys game play over graphics). it's not the worst game you will ever see in your life ... it definitely gives some 3D games i know of a run for there money.  OVERALL- i would definitely recommend that you buy this game, as a matter of fact, just buy the entire Oddbox bundle. you get all the Odd-world games for £6.99 (when not on sale). that is a steal for anyone's library as they are all definitely worth purchasing. strangers wrath although not as popular as other Odd-world title is definitely commendable for a referral as well.",1
"One of my favorite games, hours of fun! Lots of gamemodes!",1
"Amazing first impression. I like the new mechanics, the movement tweaks, and the districts. I'm not sure about the limited use builders, but building improvements in one turn is nice.  The barbarians seem much more aggresive, which is also cool. Adds some threat to the early game.  I can't wait to progress further. But for now, sleep.",1
"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Arguably the best open world RPG ever made. Another very prominent open world RPG released a few months before this but after playing TW3 I just can't bring myself to play the competition. Breathtaking graphics, talented writers and an amzing musical score to match. It will take quite an effort for the next game to come along and take the RPG heavy weight title from CDPR. A must own game for anyone who ever enjoyed an open world RPG. 10/10",1
"Beautifully presented, emotionally charged. A very short, but well made game.",1
"Okay, where do I begin. This is my first review, and I'm really excited to write up one about it. Gotta warn though, I won't address its features as much as the question, `is it worth to buy this?`  Sure is. Read on, gonna be a long one.  For a start, I'd like to ask everyone not to discard this review for the minimal amount of hours put into the game. At this very point, it's about 10 minutes. Might seem hilarious, considering you can't really fully explore the game in such a short interval, thence, you don't really have a say about its worth. Well, you might be right. Then again, I'll just try to use it to my advantage.  I'm fairly experienced in the Paradox Grand Strategies, and for one, just a brief peek was enough to forge an opinion. The game seems not only to stun the player with the array of mapmodes, parameters and alike factors simulating the whole process of governing a state of sorts (being this abstract here as I'm referring to the general features shared by all Paradox Strats), let alone the countless pop-up windows that fan out before you -- a bit confusing to distinguish the relevant from the useless ones, isn't it? -- Yeah, don't be confused. The initial size of the map you may see on the screenshot might give you an impression, `Isn't there so little to it?` It's  spacious .  And on a side note, if you happen to be in love with the Japanese (or generally asian) culture, much like me here, then you'll definitely enjoy the abundance of terminology and design just out there to help you with immersion.  Aside that, it comes for a ridiculously low price, so if you happen to be brand new to Paradoxians' products in this field, a shot at this will help you figure out if their strategies are, `cut out` for you.  Oh and, did I mention the 75% discount?  ",1

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game to pass time with. If you like creating games and making sales then this indie game is for you!",1

very fun to play but unlocking anything is a pain in the ♥♥♥,1
"Worst of all hitman games.I felt like developers made half of it,ran out of ideas and said 'let us make 1 map ,put location in China and put 5 missions on that map'.First half of the game is not bad,interesting missions in different countries and enviroments,but other half,pfff.Starting every mission with only default hitman pistols is not interesting too.Also,i felt like i was playing 'Max Payne',where the hell is daylight?!

"This is my first proper recommendation of a game on Steam. Because no other game that I have ever played has provoked my emotions in a way Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons has.  The story of two brothers against the world, fighting to save their father. A simple story, but the way it is told has to be one of the most  breath-taking  experiences a video game can muster. I can't say much with regards to the story except that if  story-driven  games are your thing, you have to play.  Every little aspect of this game, from the game controls to the language spoken by the brothers helps you connect with them, their troubles, their fears, their emotions. No game has so far captivated me this quickly and this deeply, although I am probably feeling this way because I just finished it. And that's just fine. This game is a masterpiece that everyone should experience.   Some brief review notes:    Do not judge the game solely based on the first few minutes of gameplay, as the puzzles and co-operative mechanics develop at an amazing pace. The ideas in the game are innovative, not repetitively used and are a lot of fun to experience.    Controls-wise, this game definitely has to be played with a controller with two joysticks to get the most out of the game. The keyboard controls are manageable but a controller is best. However, there are times where you are required to hold down the buttons for minutes on end which is quite stressful on the fingers.     The graphics and art are nothing special, although some of the scenes do inspire some awe in you. The game isn't about the art however and the deciding factor in whether you want to play a game should almost never be graphical quality.    Brothers makes use of the controller in a way no other game I've played has ever done. That could be my inexperience talking, but the innovative way you control the two brothers using a joystick and shoulder pad each pulls you into the game and doesn't let go. It takes some getting used to of course, but a helpful tip is to try and keep the younger brother on the right as much as possible as it helps coordinate better early on.    The speech in the game is no known language. And this is one of the best features of this game. The story does not rely on voice acting or script, but the true weight and emotion of the story itself as well as the body language and gestures of the characters. Very few games have managed to pull this off to the degree that Brothers has and I fear no other would be able to live up to this quality of story for a long time.    Puzzle platformer games are nothing new. Many games have a tried and tested formula to them. Brothers on the other hand is a game that no other game would make you go: 'Oh, this is just like that other game.' No. That will never happen. Because the mechanics of the game, they way you solve every problem, the satisfaction of achieving the goal while controlling both brothers at the same time is a unique experience in itself.   TL;DR If you love video games for what they truly are, you owe it to yourself to play this game. No game will ever be like this game. Ever.   Bros before hoes.  Nominated this for an award. Worth it.",1
"So let me start off by saying that this game is great, it's a fun game, I can easily recommend it. However, let me say that the game is not what I expected, this is not a bad thing. I was expecting a game where I would have a dungeon with levels and I was trying to prevent heroes from getting my treasure, this is not the type of game this is. Rather, it is a story that follows you and your necromancer daughter as you attempt to overthrow a kingdom. The game allows you to make decisions that affect how the game works, there are decisions that affect the ending and there are 'skills' that buff your minions, maybe give them extra health, or give you a sword that increases crit chance. Very short game, can be beat in about 2 hours. If you're looking for a game you can easily 100% it's this one. It requires 3 playthroughs to to get it, so about 6 hours for the 100%. None of the achievements are really missable, they just can only be accomplished once per playthrough. One of them is kind of misleading due to the name, so I had to put an additional 2 playthroughs in to get it, however the game is very enjoyable, each playthrough yields a new experience so I didn't mind.  TLDR: Great game, I reccomend it, easy to 100% for all you achievement hunters out there. (2 hours of gameplay, 6 hours to 100%)",1
"A great remake to my favorite game : Carnivores 2  Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, is a great game  I only wish they were more features because I like it so much  In my opinion the game need a few things to be the perfect Carnivores game  - Needs a few more dinosaurs (cause everyone loves variety) - Needs more customisation (like choosing which dinosaurs to hunt were, it would give the maps more versatility, so for example: T-rex hunters could choose from more maps ) - Could use more weapon types but that's not a critical thing  What is great about that game ?  - Its easy to learn how to play - It lauches you right into the action no waiting - The hunting mechanics are perfect - There is several map to choose from  - The Ai of the dinosaurs are good - The graphics are amasing - Its a Very Fun game if you like hunting dinosaurs.  I recommend this game completely.",1
"10/10 This game is such a masterpiece. I love doing the collectibles, level times, and checking out all the secrets and easter eggs! I find this game highly replayable and fun for everyone of all ages!",1
This game is great.,1
"Mount and Blade is a wonderful game, however there is no point in purchasing this game - not long after this original release, Mount and Blade: Warband came out. It's largely the same game, using the same map and same general mechanics, but with the inclusion of multiplayer and achievements, as well as some general questline/mechanic improvements - it's basically the same game, but more. There's effectively no advantages this original game has over Warband, so it's not really worth purchasing. The one exception to this rule is that there were some mods created for it which did not get ported to Warband, so take a look at those via a Google search to see if one of them might be up your alley.  If you're trying to complete your library or support the developer/publisher? By all means. But if you're looking for the game to purchase, pick up Mount and Blade: Warband, instead.",-1
Its pretty good.,1
this game was awesome. There are some issues with the achievements (minor bugs) but overall it rocks. Thanks for bringing out a really awesome game. End was kind of 'wtf' though.,1
"120 hours in, got perfect in every level. I want more. If it's your first time playing Space Run, play part one first. This one is huge. They've expanded the game and made changes generally for the better. Great twist on tower defence. Can't wait for the next one.",1
This game is awesome. Cant go wrong with cake.,1
A great horror shooter where you can have a lot of fun with your friends!,1
"This game is cancer, dont waste your money or time with it. If you do your sanity will not make the journey.",-1
i liked this game very much and i hope i can figure out how to get mods i do still the nazi zombies mode ailot though,1
"I would normally end up writing this game off as a standard- if rather bland- linear sidescroller to sink a couple of reasonably fun hours into and then abandon forever, but the beatmatching mechanic makes actually playing the game too obnoxious to even recommend to that extent. Put simply, you can only perform basic but essential platforming actions such as jumping and dashing if your key presses match the 'beat' of the background music. I personally don't think this type of rhythm mechanic goes well with a platformer at all, since each type of gameplay requires a different sphere of concentration- and for me, they were near impossible to combine. Clearly, I'm in the minority, given the prevalence of positive reviews, but I also doubt I'm the only one who might become frustrated with it.   Could one say I am biased because I'm not normally a rhythm game fan? Well... yes, I suppose. But I had hoped that a game that combined rhythm with a genre I'm familiar with might be easier to get into. However, Inside My Radio does not cleanly marry two types of gameplay- it merely restricts one behind another.   The keyboard controls are extremely awkward as well, but you can rebind them, at least. The music and art serve their purpose but certainly aren't anything special. I admit I didn't finish the game, but I feel like I really don't need to, given that I could barely play for a few minutes without thinking about how much more fun I could be having if the game's primary mechanic was no longer present.",-1

BEST Motorcycle Game Ever !!,1
"This was an interesting one a one to be carful of... jk! Why this game is amazing i dont know, but its truely tremedous! Never seen anything like it. This was one of the first 2014-2015 Early Access Games on my wishlist. I have the game now and i called everyone Bill and the favours are hilarious! GG Mouldy Toof, GG.. 10/10 IGN lel.   Reccomendeed for people that wonder: What Would it be like like if ii was in prison? Backfire they just watch Markiplier play it instead. 100/10!",1
A great game for people with imagination!,1
I'd highly recommend it when it's on sale for 75% off.,1
WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ALOT OF FREE TIME.  This game will take it all  ps: 44 hours on steam . atleast 400 hours without,1

"Oh my god, I don't even know how to begin this review, 10/10. This game so called 'Rocket league' is so fun and addicting, if you don't already have this game (Which you shouldn't because why would anyone go back to look at comments of the game they already have) you need to get this game. It gets really really fun when you have a couple friends playing it with you, you can work together, strive to be the greatest that anyone could ever be in rocket league. I really recommend this game to pc or consle players like you, so pick this game up, it's $19.99 but it is worth it, you wont regret it, but keep in mind , if you want to play it on high settings you are going to need a pretty good computer but I have a ok computer that can run minimum setting which still is very fun!",1
"Diablo 2 was one of my favorite games. Grim Dawn is a hack and slash much like the Diablo series. The biggest downside of the game is loot is too easy to aquire. In Diablo 2 it could take months and even years to track down loot. I thought that was a bit extreme. In Grim Dawn loot drops like candy. I'd like some kind of middle ground where getting loot is an accomplishment but not nearly impossible like Diablo 2.  Overall, still a pretty fun game at a budget price!",1
"This game is surprisingly fun but if you don't know anyone who owns it, then don't buy it. There is maybe one person playing it at any given time, if not one then none.",1
"Easy to learn, hard to master. It starts out with easy missions but they get more complex and difficult as you go. It's a pretty fun game though; it's a nice break from the shoot-'em-up games. It requires a lot of patience, but I find it very fun! Love this game! :)",1
"Like someone else said, (I forgot the username, but you can find the review) you're going to be very disappointed if you we're looking for another story-driven Might and Delight game. Instead of having to murder countless lives of animals to feed your cubs, you will befriend the food.  Meadow is a calming sandbox experience where you can be any animal from the Might and Delight games, books, etc.   I would like to say before you get the game, if this is your first time getting a Might and Delight game *COUGH COUGH* Wolfie *COUGH* we have to go over pros and cons.   Pros: -Soothing game experience -Great game to pass the time -You'll almost never be alone; this might help if you're suffering with loneliness.  -Outstanding graphics and unique origami-like style.  -It's really cheap. Possibly the least-priced Might and Delight product. -It's really fun how you figure out how to communicate in the game without online chatting and just emojis. -There aren't any people that like to 'troll' you, which is great for the younger ones.  Cons: -If you're a first time player, it'll take a bit on how to work the controls.  -If you're a first time player, you might not find the origami style appealing. This is probably because of how different Meadow is from any other game you might've played. -The frame rate might be slow and the game will crash if you have an old or terrible computer. -If you hate animals or just not that guy, this probably isn't the game for you.

"While it was fun to play D&amp;D again on a PC, this particular game has too many bugs, usability issues, and lack of content. For example, not all of the usual classes are available for use. Additionally, the lack of buttons to select specific group members, a key to cycle through targets/hostiles, an annoying cancellation of search constantly and lack of an option to re-enable search for some/all party members, makes it very tedious. Furthermore, when the game crashes, despite all of these 'auto saves' and manual saves, I lost a ton of items and experience (it saved my progress and put me back in the mausoleum where I was, but at a whole level lower and missing a ton of gear I accumulated from the last several hours of doing Luskan and the Slums). Pathing is also a problem as is the UI.",-1
"Mechanics take some time to be comfortable with, but once you 'get' them, it makes boss abilities less cheap during the big fights. Gripping storyline and stunning visuals. I paid 30 bucks for it in fall 2015, and I do no regret it one bit. Get it any less than that, and it's a steal.",1

Awesome game! This game seems easy but it is a real challenge! But no matter how frustrated I get it keeps pulling me back. I love this game,1
"Team fortress 2 was originally a game I had disregarded, seeing it as a simple shooter game that wasn't worth my time. I gave the game a try and was fairly displeased it at first, however I came back to the game a year later and my opinion had been turned around completely. In a world of drab, bland and un-stylised modern video games, team fortress 2 stands out like a saw thumb, a unique and flavourful experience that provides near limitless amounts of fun and interesting content. From medieval mode, to Mann vs. machine, this game gives a more enjoyable experience than all other FPS games I have ever played. It runs smoothly, And you can customise the game to your heart's content, with a huge variety of advanced options, downloadable huds, weapons and character skins, sprays, and in-game purchases such as the world renowned hats. The game even has crafting, a competitive scene and 9 completely different classes to choose from. And that's what settled it for me. Each of the classes at first glance are simple, categorised, fill a certain role and 6 of them share identical melee, 4 of them share identical shotgun-secondary's. However, this is the best part, you can change up your loud outs, and become completely different classes altogether, such as the demo knight and battle-engineer. This will keep you coming back for years. The game modes are well thought out, well balanced, and are accompanied by maps that help you figure out where to go, lead you in the right direction, whilst providing enough flavour to be interesting to look at after the tenth time playing on the map, but don't take your eyes of your enemy. The Classes voice actors did a great job making each of the characters fleshed out and entertaining (and for me, especially the soldier and sniper) and each of the classes are well designed, so much so that even from a distance, wherein crazy hats and misc. items, you can still tell who is who and which team they are on, which is fantastic for a lot of people, especially those first getting to grips with the game. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted First person shooter, that entices you to come back and play more, all for the wonderful price of NOTHING! (of course you end up spending tonnes on hats and keys, but maybe you might get lucky and sell a unusual hat on Christmas day for £91... :P ) ",1
"Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date. There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!",1
"The final verdict: C+  I will still give this game a reccomendation because I paid about $3 and it's pretty good. So it's a recommendation ONLY WHEN IT'S ON SALE.   The game loses most of it's value from the 'grenade' zombies that will lob grenades at you and literally kill you in one hit. However, once you realize that money is almost pointless, dying often isn't even a big deal because you can just pay to respawn. I don't do well with zombies that know how to use weapons (I guess sticks/melee weapons are OK, but that's where I draw the line).  Other than that you're in for a nice shallow kill all zombies that you see type game. It's nothing special but if you're a zombie fan it's worth getting this when it's on sale. A couple of bucks for at least 10 hours of fun is sometimes better than what some expensive DLC will offer.",1
What can I say? This game is fecking awesome!  It is just wonderfully silly.  The absurdity of a goat bouncing on a trampoline gave me some genuine laugh out loud moments.  If you play this game you WILL laugh. So funny and I like the way you get points for everything!  'headbut fence bonus'. Brilliant.  A brilliand daft wee time waster.,1
Just play it,1
"Really fun, adventurous game! Great story line and combat along with some nice graphics and gameplay. I would definently recommend this game to anyone i know!",1
"This game is fun, especialy for those how like post apocalyptic survival kinda games. You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits.  Don't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.  Over all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one. Because has we all know thats how games work.",1
"Played over 90 hours, still love it. Modding the game is good as well, and it's fun to play as the community-made characters.",1
Not as fun as the first,-1
10/10 would recommend this game to everyone. its fun and complex so it doesnt get boring.,1
"WARNING!: Thia game is highly addictive! its a fun all around zombie survival game! only down side is its single player, if it had co-op it would be alot more fun, the new expansion pack is hard as hell, but makes it more enjoyable, i just wish it had better homes you could set up in, missions are a bit repetitive but thats what survival is all about, doing stuff repetitive to survive, I.E get crafting supplys, food, saving people, changing safe house locations, etc i give this game 4 stars it would be 5 if they had better safehouses (or the ability to build your safehouse where ever :) )",1
This game is alright here is why:   1. This game is WAYYY to grindy i know some people don't like that but dam why do i have to reunlock everything i worked so hard to unlock on a different soldier of the same nation  2. Loseing games go on forever we know we lost so finnish the game end it but no the struggle goes on and we lose 15 or more minutes later  3. I became a sniper class expecting to get a sniper or something with a scope but i just got a default semi auto no scope rifle WTH how do i recon with something that can't even see down the sites  4. This game is free so it's a +  5. should you put enough time to a character and get some better weapons and want to go play with a freind ur screwed if they have a different class or fraction that you don' have time put in with,-1
"This game is a crap tone of funn! &lt;3 it , can't wait for dishonored 2!",1
"Battleborn is a great game that just can't catch on.  If you can get past the learning curve, I believe you will truly enjoy this game. That being said, there is no tutorial to the PvP modes, and Incursion (the moba mode) could definitely use one. Matchmaking is horrendous, I often get paired up against a pre made team of 100's (by often I mean every game). Even from level 1. The are character unlocks which mean people with higher level characters will have the advantage.  The game is fun tho, the characters are colorful and funny, full of personality. The story mode has a couple of good misions, but the rest feel a little rushed. Overall it's a fun game.",1
"A free game that is an amazing one. The first ghost is the easiest with the exception of sometimes randomly showing up in fromt of you when you are fleeing. The second one scales th difficulty and tension in the second part. Worth the download!! A short but not an easy adventure. It is, however, a scary good time.",1

"Innovative, pretty and very polished, but becomes repetitive rather quickly. I found the world and narrative too surreal to be engaging. If the developers had been more ambitious and included some more gameplay elements and a more interactive world, I might have been hooked. As it is, I think this game is more interesting to talk about than to play.",-1
Its one of the games which i still like after all patches and stuff ... but even after opening like 100 crates i still cant get dominus gt so if there is someone who will help me with that even just by a trade ... pls add me i really want that one car....,1

"~~2015 RETRO REVIEW~~  If you want a MTG game to play, buy this or DotP 2013. As of writing this, this year's MTG game isn't out yet, but DotP 2015 is absolute garbage.  Overall, this game is more or less as good as 2013 in terms of decks, but where it really shines is a vastly improved upon singleplayer. There aren't many special gimmicks though like a specific mode (like Archenemy or Planechase in earlier games), but there's a solid amount to play solo. As stated in my 2013 review, 2013 and 2014 are the two high points of the series and I recommend them both over any DotP game that came out before or since.",1

So I decided to build the company store then upgrade it to the company mall where it promises that I will be able to cut costs of my employees by 15% each level. However, when I proceed to do it. nothing happens. My costs still remains the same. manufacturing costs and the rest are the same. is this game broken? And when i'm playing in the normal mode it seems that even if I had the 'researcher' specialised field, i'm always being overtaken. Even though many years has passed, bugs are prominent in this game causing it to crash.

"I started off this game about 30 minutes after it released and I have been playing it in most of my free time since then.   First off is performance. As we all know, console games ported to PC tend to have... Issues. I'm running a 6600K with a 4GB GTX 770 and 16GB of DDR4 2133MHz RAM which by no means will play on ultra (requires 6GB of VRAM to play comfortably) so I stuck with high the entire game which still looks very good. During the    train explosion scene    near the beginning of the game my computer managed to lock up for 15 minutes. It locked up so badly that I could not even open up task manager or ctrl+alt+delete and had to restart my computer. It proceeded to play the next scene after. Loading screen at the end of that scene is just black with the loading symbol. It stayed at this screen for 15 minutes before I then heard every line of the following conversation start at the same time. Another five or so minutes later, it then would display the scene and show one frame of the scene every 5-10 seconds. About another five minutes later, everything started running smoothly like the initial level. After that I have had zero performance issues at all. It may be isolated to this one spot in the game but I thought I would mention it anyway. I've kept max framerate up everywhere else after this point.  Gameplay-wise, the cover system is good and bad, I much prefer the cover system from the older game. The new augs I have not played with much except for    Remote Hacking    as I was not a fan of the trade-off to the new augs. My playthroughs are typically complete stealth and takedowns so I cannot speak for weapon handling for anything other than the tranq rifle which I fired about 20 shots out of including    the fight with Marchenko    and my only gripe with it is that it seems to be a hitscan weapon in this game rather than the last where you had to worry about distance when it came to aiming. I have fired a few magazines out of the pistol during    the TF base shooting range tutorial    along with the combat rifle. A few EMP rounds used which were useful since I stayed away from the newer augs until    getting The Calibrator    later on. All of the other guns, I have not fired.  Side missions in this game are all good and I had no issue completing every single one that I could find as they did not feel repetitive like you might find with some sidequests in a game like Skyrim. The game all ties together fairly well story-wise.   Here comes the 'controversial' portion of this review: the world itself. The game was getting blasted for signs like 'aug lives matter' showing up in the promo material and I do not understand at all why that is. The world this game is trying to portray is specifically meant to give the impression that augs are essentially second class scum after the Aug Incident. I think in the game it was stated that 89% of augs died during this incident but I don't remember exactly. The aug population either way ends up being very small contrary to the total world population. The world is something like 1950s America but with naturals and augs while it's set in 1940s Germany. Aug entrances are in the back, aug sections of the stations are filthy while the naturals side is spotless, the constant comments about augs, etc. You will even occasionally get stopped by police officers walking around asking for your papers. The world works well but it would be nice to hear more of the conversations between people in the world that has to do with things other than augmented/natural-related conversations. Maybe throw in a few about other current events unrelated to this?  Overall my experience is that the game plays very smoothly performance-wise and I don't have any notable issues with UI elements or anything like that. Not many bugs that I have seen surprisingly other than maybe the beginning as mentioned in my performance section. Given the ending I am very much looking forward to more Deus Ex, whenever that may be...",1

"The best melee combat in a shooter format since Jedi Knight, though a few of the guns are underpowered. Monsters are fun to fight until the game starts throwing pairs of Berzerkers at you, and the level design starts to falter near the end. While the game is probably a bit too long and gets repetitive, the story is better than expected and keeps everything moving. Not sure what kind of combos it's expecting to max-out karma score and the secrets are definitely challenging to find.   Buy it if you like Ninja Gaiden or Serious Sam.",1
Great game to play with friends. Fiendishly difficult at higher difficulties and rewards good team play. Local coop is a great bonus too.,1
"Tomb Raider (2013) is an excellent game, it's a reboot that restored my faith on Tomb Raider series. I bought it the day before yesterday and already played it for ~12 hours. The story is very engaging and the gameplay is tenseful.  Tomb Raider is an excellent port since its graphics is even better than Alan Wake: AN, but also runs more smoothly on a laptop GPU. No crashes, bugs, graphical anomalies, indeed it does look very impressive.  Excellent gamepad support. It's really made to be played with a gamepad.",1

"DUde, what?",1
"Decent hidden object game, but sections where you actually have to find hidden objects tend to be kinda tricky. Not because items are cleverly hidden, but because they're sometimes really hard to tell apart from the background (I'm looking at you tweezers). Plot is not so great and feels quite forced. I did like how you can explore around and gather items from different locations to use them later on (enter the shop, proceed to pilfer everything that you can and only after then call for the owner). Not my favourite hidden object game, there are lot better out there.",-1

"True to the spirit of Dungeon Keeper, with a fea very good changes to the formula that add inoovative and interesting game play.  The game needs a bit of polish, especially in the UI. The developers seem to be rapidly addressing the outstanding issues, and this game is on track to become a classic.",1
It's only 5 hours long so I'd recommend buying it in a sale but this game is really fun. The mechnaics only seem to get fleshed out towards the end which sucks but there's mod support so I have no doubt people will make more content.,1

"I'm not going to say that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, because there are issues that prevent it from earning that but it is a good game.  The character creation tools feel lackluster to start but the system of choosing your class and being able to respec for fairly cheap makes one character incredibly replayable on top of the many paths availible in the game to all kinds of playstyles you can easily swap character abilities to meet any challenge.  Combat feels boring because you kind of just mash the attack key and you either infinitely hitstun your opponent or they do the same to you. The fancier things you can do come from things like spells or abilities that, while flashy, never do as much damage as a basic attack with a good weapon.  The story is amazingly well-written and going out of your way to find more Lore is actually fun to do with the Lorestones. I enjoyed listening to the stories they told and the setting is a certain kind of western fantasy that hasn't been touched on a lot. Faerie lore, the Sidhe and other such things I mean. The main cast is mostly forgettable except for Alyn Shir (the dark elf you're trying to bed) and Agarth (your best bro). I'd say the voice-acting is a B+ at most with some cringe here and there.  There's a lot of potential in this game for enjoyment but it is by no means better than games like The Witcher but it does offer an interesting 30-60 hour experience (depending on how side-questy you feel).  I give this game one thumb up, one thumb sideways, two potatoes, some spare change and a nice country cabin in Yorkshire out of 10.",1

You will experience buyer's remorse 1 hour into the game after you've already experienced 90% of the content it has to offer (literally only 5 different dinosaurs in the entire game). Maybe if the developers continued to support it for another few years it could be really good, but by the looks of it they already don't care about it. The core of the game is fun, but at the end of the day it is too easy and lacks content to keep playing for.",-1

"Wow... Just wow. I was debating with this game for a long time. I still don't know exactly if it was worth it.  Pros: It has a great story to it and the gameplay is simplistic, but not in a bad way. It really hooks you and make you want to play more. The game is extremely responsive and it's obvious that it was given its time in development before it was released to the public. The soundtrack really is beautiful and comes with the game's purchase along with development and marketing images.  Cons: EXTREMELY SHORT! It is not worth the $5 price tag because of this. Get it on sale! There is only 4 levels and even with the challenge modes it with only take about an hour to finish the entire thing. I REALLY, REALY, REALLY want there to be more to this game! It has so much potential!",1

I would request a refund but from what I've read these guys are famous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. View range is absurd and I'm pretty sure that's what's giving me terrible fps. The game isn't good enough to bother looking into the config files.  To be honest, the game was terrible anyway. The concept and idea of the game is awesome. This is just a terrible execution of the idea.  You spend 90% of your time playing this running in a straight line between destinations.",-1

"First off, you must know that this isn't exacly a game, but a story made in RPG a style with some exploration and puzzles. But without spoiling anything, the story told here is superb. And to top it off, the music will also get you. As you live this story, you will cry (or almost), fell happy and laugh. But in the end you will know everything was worth it. And there's also free DLC. But if you want a game to play, go somewhere else. If, however, you want to give it a shot, this is a masterpiece from beggining to end.",1

"I like Mass Effect 2 because it brings a good story. The team that made this is awesome I would recommend this game plus Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 3 which you can get on Origin Besides that Mass Effect 2 is like Mass Effect 1 but what is different is that there is no Mako,  I would defently recommend this game and if you think you have to Play Mass Effect 1 first, that is not the case I just knew the story of Mass Effect 1, and I was able to play Mass Effect 2 but either way if you like Sci-fi RPG's Third-Person Shooter's then you should defently play Mass Effect series Bioware, you guys did an awesome job making the Mass Effect games, and I give you guys credit!",1
"I bought a four pack of this game because I've been looking for a good co-op game to play with friends and despite the bugs that are there; as long as I have a clear head I am willing to ignore them but would absolutely love to have them fixed. This game is packed with content and while some of the contracts are a bit repetitive it's not something that bothers me. Playing this game with friends will give you the ultimate experience, and while this game is first and foremost an action game; do not be fooled, it will make you think critically.",1
"I highly reccomend  Papo &amp; Yo . The story is quite moving, particularly at the end. The game reminds me of the movie   Pan's Labyrinth  [www.imdb.com]   in the way it uses a fantasy world as a metaphor to address a serious real-world problem. I don't have any personal experience with the subject matter of  Papo &amp; Yo , but found it deeply affecting nonetheless.  Playing as a young Brazilian boy in a somewhat poor and run-down village is a refreshing change from the characters and settings found in most other games. The game incites a giddy sense of child-like fun despite its dark underlying story.  The game contains beautiful and mesmerizing graffiti artwork on display on various walls in the game.  Here's an article on  PlayStation Blog   [blog.us.playstation.com]  about it by the game's director Vander Caballero. From the article:  &gt; It’s worth noting that these are real works of graffiti art licenced for use in the game, taken from the vibrant street art scene in major cities like Brazil’s Sao Paulo, and Chile’s Valparaiso and Santiago.   Here's an example of the artwork  [www.flickr.com]  (from its actual location, not the game, though the reproduction in the game is nearly the same).  I felt quite satisfied after completing this game, though it is fairly short and doesn't seem to lend itself much to replay. Still, I felt it was well worth what I paid. The story stuck with me in my mind for a few days.  The game is a unique experience and certainly worth the price.",1
you know why i did this,-1
"I have great memories of this game, but today they were shadowed and let my anger take over. You see, for some unexplainable reason this game is not literally unplayable but the controls make it unplayable for the 'Ultimate' Spider-Man fan.

Better than Skyrim.  Never played Morrowind but I’m told its better than Oblivion.  Deal with it. ,1

"How many hours will i spend in supercruise.... 100?.... 1000? so much time spent doing absolutely nothing. The game does have good ideas but also has zero, nada, nothing, no story at all and a huge amount of success depends on chance encouters at an early level and lotsssss of getting brutally destoyed by significatly better equiped ai. The combat is very good and my desire to master it is significant.... buuuutttt..... don't get into a fight with a cobra at early stages their shields regenerate far to quickly I give the whole game 4/10.",-1

"Really enjoyed this reboot!! If you liked the original Devil May Cry (or 2, 3, or 4) you'll love this one.  Fast-paced combat, interesting platformer elements and an edgy, sexy storyline.  Also, they may have changed the character design of Dante, but he still has his cheeky one-liners. So, don't let that throw you off.",1

"Rebirth of a popular back in the day tactical action game, involving Alien invasions on earth. Great looking top down, turn based, Alien repellent. Earth is once again invaded by Aliens, and you are given the chance to fight and eliminate them. Research different technologies from killed Aliens, construct weapons, tools and armor to aid your troops in combat. Level your troops and equip them with gear, build and expand your underground base, and stop the invasion. Take part in missions all over the globe to combat Alien invaders, in challenging turn based tactical combat. Great quantity of Alien enemy, weapons, armor and maps available. Game has good visuals, story, voice acting and animations, is a challenging experience even on easy. A bit of a downside that you can't co-op it with your friends vs. the Aliens.",1
"Starts out quite stright fordward shooter, pickingup ammo and armor and running like crazy. That felt a bit disappointing first, but as soon as the story starts to develop, it really hooked me up and got mehours playing, admiring the amazingly detailed graphics, and se super interesting designs from backgrounds and characters.  The way you play it's really up to you, crouching and stealth killing or jumping around blasting everything, and also this leads you to unlock skills and new abilities. Definitely a great game, highly recomended. Pros: - Amazing graphics and designs - Playable on stealth or blow everything up mode - Good immersing story and characters - Great sound and music - Solid movement, physics, weapons, and combat Cons: - I haven't finished the game by the time of writing this, if I find something I'll edit the review  EXCELLENT shoter.",1
"I used to obsess over this game back when I played Xbox 360 almost religiously. I had all of the DLC (a bit disappointed that the necromancer pack isn't on Steam), all of the achievements, and had every character maxed out. I am working on accomplishing that again. This is a really fun little RPG that I do think everyone should give a try. If you don't understand how to play this, you'll learn pretty quick. It's cute, quirky, and bloody!",1
"Despite all of it's issues (which Capcom have been very open about), this is still a great game. Yeah, the minimum requirements are pretty high, there is no arcade, and only Xinput sticks are supported, there is still one of the best competitive fighting games to be enjoyed. From my (limited) experience, the new online features work great.  So, I recommend it, providing you know that at this stage, it is not quite finished.  But... I don't think Capcom should have released it yet. I mean, just look at its 40% rating. Maybe they should have tried early access.",1
well it would be fun if i could play it...,-1

"This sad, beautiful little game is both amazing, cool, and extremely aggrivating. The puzzles are usually cool, but sometimes frustrating. Other times they're downright cruel. It's worth it for the soundtrack alone, though. 3/5",1
"This game is good because it has a great story of fighting a monster destroying the world, the company is adding more adventures like your rivals coming back to get revenge on you , this game took them a long time because they built all of this in Minecraft to put it in the game, there is lots of combat and features like crafting, and building.",1

"Final Fantasy VIII was an EXTREMELY large part of my childhood, introducing me to the RPG genre and getting me into gaming in general, i'm extremely thankful for my older brother introducing this game to me, it's a work of art, in my opinion, the characters are awesome, the story is simply incredible, and the music is amazing, it's an extremely underrated game, in my opinion, it's definitely worth the $12 to pick this game up and embark on the journey of a lifetime!",1
"This game is unbelievably addictive. I love the sprite art too, reminds me of old NES games. The music reminds me of wonderful JRPG scores from the early 2000s. That's just my first impression. This game combines elements of RPGs but is a 'GO RIGHT' platformer. The challenges are sometimes very difficult, but always a lot of fun. The dialog and scripting in the game is well written and amusing--sort of poking fun at both RPGs and platformers.   This is a great game if you don't want to commit a lot of brainpower to a game and are looking for something fun to play that is constantly changing.",1
"Took 7.1 hours to beat. After finishing the last level, I decided to play Dark Souls 2 for something more calming.",1

Yeah it's pretty good...,1
"Why wouldnt anybody like this game? Claiming it to be a 'Rip off of Minecraft' is like calling Borderlands 2 a rip off of GOW 3! They are the same genre, so similarites can be expected. All in all, a great game.",1
"This is a provisional review after playing for the first chapter:  Controls: adequate, except there is an annoyance with the enter button having double duty as a status screen as well as a dialog mover.  Art: Good  Music: Not very inspiring  Voice acting: almost OK  Gampeplay: OK, I wonder if it will have longer tables and more pinball style boards. The RPG boards are OK, but limiting.  RPG elements: Clever use of balls as characters, but not much RPG mechanics otherwise. I'd call it an adventure rather than an RPG.  Price: 10$ is a fair launch price.",1

"Phenomenally atmospheric game with solid gameplay. The story is engaging from the start and progress is natural as there is never a pause in storytelling nor a time you have to grind to advance. I played this with a gamepad and I'm unsure if I would like it as much if I used my keyboard; the fluidity gamepad allows seems better suited to this game, especially on higher difficulties. From the ground up this game seems polished; the artstyle, the combat, the soundtrack, the gear and skill progression, the voice-acting, the story... It was a great ride and leaves me looking forward to Supergiant's future ventures. [10/10]",1
You want to call this game boring but it's addictive and you end up playing for hours.,1
"so i picked this up during the summer of sale and it's fun. now i'm one of those horrible gamers that sticks this sort of game on easy and casuals the hell out of it. if i can shoot it i shoot it. if it's an old lady i can park a car onto, i do it. in this game i can harpoon m, attach m to my car and drive m around the neighbourhood if i was so inclined. and i am. what nags me about this is the HUGE map. where GTA and Saints Row offer a city and some outlying regions here you have an entire island nation to explore. that means that you end up actually commuting to your next mission. i have literally spend half an hour driving to a site because i wanted to do a certain mission. now that is fun for a bit (lots of old ladies to harpoon) but it does get old a bit when you have to get around to a lot of different missions. Skyrim at least had a fast travel option. here fast travel is either causing enough chaos to have the police come in a chopper and hijack that and fly to your next destination or get a faster car. So all in all a cool game that lets you muck about all you want and has a main character like spiderman with a gun and a better personality.",1

"Out of the 7 hours I played this game, i managed to beat it.  Let me tell you this game is worth the 7 hours i played it. It teaches you about the game industy, it has all the pasts best consoles come on the market the accurat times they did in real life, and also had them exit the market the accurate times they did in real life as well. So it does teach you a lot about today and yesterdays consoles.  Pros -  This game has a great amount of time, not to long, not to short. Just right!!!  This game runs very smooth with no lag on high end. and low end PCs!!!  This game has a wide variety of things to do, and you have to unlock a lot of them making the story more fun!!!  This game has an amazing replay value, which i will defently replay this game and add hours!!!  This game has amazing mod support, and the workshop has some pretty wacky and useful mods to improve the game!!!   Cons -   This game can get a little buggy and laggy for some workshop mods, including cheat mods that improve money!!!  This game does not have that good of an ending, but i will let you guys find that out for yourselves!!!  This game does not really have anymore updates, but what can you expect from a two year old game!!!  This game can be played after beating the game, but it starts to get a little boring after you officially beat it endless you start a new game, (basically when you beat the game start a new one or else you will get real bored real quick!!!)   Thats all the game is defenetly more good than it is bad, and it is worth the 10$ you will spend on it. I already beat it in 7 hours but im not complaining that i cant get a refund because i want to continue playing this game. For those who bought this two years ago should still be playing it and for thoe who have not bought or played it yet get your wallet out and spare 10$ for this masterpiece, it is worth every penny and second of time you spend on it!!!",1

Running through, what I think is pretty safe to assume, old New York I jumped down a ledge with the girl on my back only to freeze in mid air. Sorry, but I probably will never finish this game.",-1

"Tomb Raider is a combination of the best genres put together. This Action-Adventure-Platform game is one of the BEST I think I have ever played in my entire life. The graphics compare to Crysis, every single detail makes you feel there. The music makes the mood for you, it has kept its classic PS1 drive of making the music and atmoshpere set the tone of where you are. I sometimes, while playing, get scared for Lara, or even worried for here. I feel the emotion she has when facing her friends and enimies. They did a terrific job defining how games should be made. This has steth elements, optinal tomb's it is literally for everyone. This is my favorite game of all time. 10/10",1
"Dear Esther is an immersive, beautiful story. It requires a wish to explore, and an ability to piece together small bits of a nonlinear narrative. Some others describe this as a 'scary' game- the eerieness of being alone in a place where other exist/have existed can be... disconcerting at times, especially with a couple of events. However, this just adds to the story and the entire feel of the game. It is certainly enjoyable and beautiful, well worth the money and time to play through.",1
It is pretty good,1

"Friday at Freddy's is quite a unique game with jump scares, spooky sounds, and some of the worst surveillance equipment on the face of the Earth. Your job is to keep watch of Freddy and his buddies and make sure there's no roughhousing. You also need to watch out for yourself as they will come and try to scare you. So far I've been on night 3, I've never been spooked by Freddy or his friends but I've given myself a few leg cramps, and screamed a little.   EDIT: I take everything back! Three of the same titles in less than a year by the same dude, I mean really? Don't give this guy anything. He's only in it for the money.",1

"Good game amazing graphics and a juicy story line im one of the people who had the game lagging but i just updated my drivers and its fine now. Also i never played 2009 so a lot of it im missing but still its a amazing game if you ask me. they should also make DLC for this game because there are places we have not seen like Russia ,Africa ,USA and places in Asia.",1

"This review is for the MAIN GAME, NOT the DLC This game will BLOW YOUR FREAKING MIND. Gameplay: This is a first person game and throught the game, you would have access to multiple different weapons to choose from. The melee weapon is just so satisfying to use when you execute people by grinding their head against it or just ripping it off. Also, it is incorporated into the sky-railway system thing(i forgot what its called) that lets you traverse this floating city so it seems useful through the entire game. You can loot the bodies of those poor souls you mauled through, the would carry different items but most of the time it would either give you health,salt or ammo. The salt can be used to charge or fuel your vigours which are these powers you get by drinking different bottles, this wouldn't be a surprise if you played the other bioshock games. The powers in infinite compared to BioShock 1&amp;2 are similar in certain ways but have been graphically improved and modified slightly to give it more power or make it more satisfactoy such as seeing someone burn to a crisp or get eaten alive by crows.  You can upgrade your vigours to make it deal more damage, consume less salt or give it additional effects. You can also upgrade your arsenal to hold more ammo or deal more damage as well. After a certain point in the game, elizaberth will aid you in different ways like providing ammo or cover or allow you to get a better vantage point on your enemies. There isn't a huge variety of enemies but they either a)Is insanely tank(alot of health) b) Come in pretty large groups or C)both. It gives you this feeling that the entire city's forces are coming for you. Story: I will try to not spoil the story of BioShock Infinite but i can tell you this; IT IS AMAZING. I highly recommend finishing the entire story before playing something else as it has this amazing WOW factor. Even though this is a single player first person shooter and the game can hint to you where to go to proceed down the story line, it is really worth to explore and loot the surrounding area. This game will put you through some emotional times and different areas of the game will test your humanity. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FINISHING THE GAME, the ending(through my experience) was just MIND F**CKED ME SO HARD when the credits rolled, i was just befuddled, totally speechless. This game is just that good. I hope that you found my review useful, thanks for reading!",1
"If you like visual puzzles and games with proper physics, well almost, you'll enjoy this. I've got into a habit of doing one or two medium level puzzles a day. It gets me into the right mood for doing other online studies I'm doing. The cartoon, 2D animations work well and there is a good variety. The puzzles are the cascade type where by one action will trigger a chain of other reactions to achieve the final goal. The puzzles start with a few contraptions in place and you have to fill in the gaps from the range of contraptions provided. There is also a sandbox whereby you can build your own cascades and publish them online. Very good value at the sale price.",1
"Being a fan of puzzle and thoughtful games most of my life, I am recommending this. The puzzles are well thought out, some challenging, some not. They are varied and are not always the same thing over and over again, which is definitely a plus. The scenery and atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. In this game, you need to 'think outside of the box' on more than 10 occassions. Replay value is there, if you enjoy puzzlers. 10/10 would Path again.",1

"Darkest Dungeons is a unique game, it's so unlike anything I've ever played before that I'm not sure that there is one genre I could describe it as. As I'm lacking a genre, I'm going to make one up. Darkest Dungeon is a strategic Lovecraftian themed resource management game with elements of dungeon crawling. It's quite a mouthful, I know, but it's the most accurate title I can create. Popularly this game is referred to as a roguelike dungeoncrawler, but I've played many roguelike dungeoncrawlers and would not describe Darkest Dungeon like that at all.  You play as a relative of the now deceased owner of an estate. It is your mission to cleanse the estate of the many horrors that lurk there and in the surrounding countryside. This is accomplished through expeditions that reward you with resources that can be used to restore the hamlet to its former glory. As you upgrade the hamlet and defeat bosses further details of the game's story slowly unravel.  For each mission you choose a team of four heroes to send off. Which heroes you choose, which skills they have, and what position you place them in are all important for combat. In addition to the heroes you take, you must also decide what supplies you want to bring. It reminds me of Oregon trail in way, except it's far more terrifying. What's really interesting about Darkest Dungeon is the stress mechanic. As you traverse through dungeons the stress level of a hero will slowly increase. There are also enemy attacks that inflict stress. Once stress reaches 100/200 a hero will either gain an affliction or become virtuous. A hero that becomes afflicted has effectively lost their mind and will be a detriment to the party and a virtuous hero overcomes their stress and becomes a positive actor. At 200 points of stress a hero will have a heart attack. Stress can be reduced by camping, from certain skills, and through activities in the hamlet.  Stress is something that I don't recall ever seeing addressed in a videogame before. It makes a lot of sense really. You frequently see games starring a hero that spends their days slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of people/monsters/robots/whatever. At the end of the day it seems likely that they'd have quite the case of PTSD. The stress mechanic also factors into the resource management aspect of the game. Heroes in Darkest Dungeon are somewhat disposable, but it is still in your best interest to keep them alive. This means that at any given time it is likely you will have a number of your characters assigned to a stress recovery activity and locked out use for expeditions. The end result is that you will want a roster filled with possible teams rather than one dedicated group.  Maintaining a roster with multiple teams is more involved than one might expect. Dungeons have max level restrictions, and you can only enter a dungeon with a full party of four. If you don't have enough characters within the level range for a mission you will not be able to attempt it at all. In an effort to make sure everyone is at the right level at the right time, I found myself doing hundreds of expeditions. The real issue here and main flaw with Darkest Dungeon is that once you've done two or three missions in each area, you've seen almost everything the game has to offer. I found it to be extremely repetitive. The tedium of doing the same missions over and over is compounded by some late game events (nothing specific to avoid spoilers) that ultimately increase the amount of repetition.  Darkest Dungeon looks and sounds excellent. The characters, enemies, and town all look very impressive. I don't know what the name of the art style is but it reminds me of a pop-up books. I'm not sure where they found the announcer, but he really makes the game. His booming disembodied voice shouts memorable quotes as you battle your way through dungeons. I had some of his phrases stuck in my head weeks after I finished playing the game.  Darkest Dungeon was difficult for me to review on Steam. The restriction of recommend “yes/no” is too simplistic. If there were a “maybe” option, it's what I would choose to give this game. In my mind the graphical style and sound are so strong and so memorable that the game gains major points in these categories. The idea of stress affecting adventurers in a game is creative and something I haven't seen elsewhere. It's implemented in a very clever way that is very logical if you've had any real life experience with stress. I loved how heroes resort to vices in an attempt to relieve stress. Unfortunately the gameplay falls a little flat. I found it to be somewhat easy, simplistic, and tedious. This is a game that I would cautiously recommend, and only if it is on sale. For those looking for a dungeon crawler, be aware that this is more of a resource management type of game.   Click here to see my other reviews. ",-1

But if you are crazy with all that zombie apocalypse stuff then you will probably enjoyed it more, I unfortunately don't have underground bunker full of canned food and weapons and I don't check every morning if zombies are walking on the street and my biggest dream come true :P So for me it is just what it is, no hype from my side :) But whatever float your boat, if this is your poison go for it :)",1
"In a word - dissapointing. Very short (finished in 2-3 short hours), yet manages to be repetative. if you are a fan of the neverhood - i recommend keeping the nostalgia alive by not trying this one.  ",-1
"I like this game. I like it a great deal It is not without its difficulties nad challenges, but as several people have said before, if you look at where Civ V is today (the game from which this one got its skeleton), its clear that Firaxis still knows how to put together an excellent and lovingly balanced game.  I'm not entirely sure Civ: BE is there quite yet, but it is still quite fun. In addition, the things it does well are done beautifully.  Tech Tree: The tech tree is rich, and it is wide. This means that you have to specialize to develop towards your victory strategy, and that you will be leaving things out as you do so. The way that they have the military units implemented do an excellent job of rewarding your choices rather than punishing your shortfalls. In addition, the 'Steal tech' option is always valuable, as there is no way that you have researched even all of the second ring of tech by the end of the game, so a little bit of free midrange tech is a nice little reward.  Culture Tree: Again, they did an excellent job of rewarding your choices, whether you choose to specialize or generalize. Every tree has rewards after so many virtues are unlocked, and every virtue tier has rewards for the same, regardless of which tree those virtues are in.  Military: Units never obsolete, and the affinity paths that you choose (be they specialized or broad) allow you access to powerful benefits for the core units as well as affinity-specific units which further have some benefits for developing a secondary affinity. Fewer overall core units, but more choices than Civ.  Overall, I think this is a very good start. If Civ: BE gets the same degree of attention that the Civ V series has over the past couple years, I think that the things that really make it shine today will be the very things that will make it an overall richer game than Civ V is today.",1

"Ive played the original version of this game ages ago. It was and still is great fun but i lost the disc recently. SO I saw that this was on sale and bought it. When it downloaded it lagged horrendesly due to this 'precaching' problem people have. Its quite hard to play at 15fps ya'know. Finally, Im on windows and and after I downloaded this game and shut down the computer my pc would not start up. So I hard to reboot and delete everything. After I had redownloaded steam and this game,the next time i turned on my computer it had messed it up again.   Great Game Doesnt like my computer :P",1

"The few exhausted orc warriors continue down the dirt path. Many of them are wounded, some even fatally. Looking back they see the remains of their loyal trained wolves, burnt and pierced by arrows. But now is not the time for sorrow. They must continue.  The strongest, not counting the chained ogre, of the orc warriors feels fear creeping in his heart as another one of his bretheren passes on by the lingering poison of elven arrows. The orc does not even have a name. He doesn't need one. He is replacable.  'We're just puppets.' he thinks to himself. Is conquering a small patch of land really worth hundreds of casualties? The answer was obvious and he knew it. No.  But do the highest of orc warlords care if an orc falls on his best friends' arms in the battlefield? Do they even bother to inform his family? No.  'We are replacable.' he silently says out loud. The few orcs that hear him lower their head, knowing what feelings were going through him. The ones that heard only a few silent whispers were too tired to ask what he had said.  The group regain some of their strength and march over an old wooden bridge. They can already see what waits ahead. A patch of 6 knights, armored so heavily detecting their species was impossible.  'Hah!' An orc yells, 'We have three times more heads in our group!'  The strongest orc, or just Strongest, says 'No.'  'Do you see those wooden towers around the roads? Thought they were just guardhouses? Think again.'  The orc sprints about 15 meters forward to get a good sight of the buildings. As soon as he stops, he spots small movement on top of the tower.  'There's someone up the-' The orc was silenced by a man-sized wooden barrel falling on top of him, crushing both of his legs.   Two more orcs run to him to pull him to safety, but the moment they reach him the barrel explodes, creating a wall of flame around the scene.  'We must push on!' Strongest exclaims. 'We have no choice.' The orcs release a warcry stronger than any warrior has ever created, and charge towards the guards.    Strongest hunches himself forward on the road. He has placed his sword between his arm and the ground, supporting his left leg wich had a small piece of cloth tied over it. Fresh blood was dripping from it. 'Why did I run.' He thinks as he keeps going. He still remembers most of what happened, even after getting a major blow in the head. He remembers them striking down a guard using the element of suprise, and then going sword-to-sword with the other five, while bombs were being hurled at them. He remembers how he saw his bretheren go down one by one. He remembers realizing there is no chance of victory. He remembers sprinting past the distracted guards. He remembers the physical and emotional pain.  Strongest pulls an arrow off his left arm. The arrow had hit the muscle. This hand will not be helping him anymore.  He keeps going, leaving a clear line of blood behind him.  Strongest looks forward for the first time in fifteen minutes. His jaw hits the floor.  The exit.  The way to leave this place stands less than a hundred meters from him.  'I survived.' he whispers with tears falling from his cheeks. Having to leave his family did not do it. Watching his pets die did not do it. Betraying his friends for his own survival did not do it. But seeing the exit, the portal to get away from all of this, to live. That is what finally broke his emotional wall.  Fifty meters. He repeatedly raises his speed.  Twenty-five meters. He is running, his mind overcoming the physical pain.  Fifteen meters. He will survive  Ten meters. He can see his family again.  Five meters. 'Here I g-'  Strongest was cut off by a huge clank. Again. Once more. A gigantic colossus of a being emerges from the forest, walking in front of him, blocking the road. The giant is covered with black armour, wielding a shield bigger than Strongest himself in his, or it's, left hand. The colossus unsheats his black sword. It's hilt is decorated with the largest ruby Strongest has even seen.  This weapon could decapitate an ogre with almost no effort.  'I am coming, brothers.' Strongest whispers, as the colossus swings down it's massive blade.",1

I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more.  If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your 'to play list'. The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, But never crashed or coursed me any mager issues.   ",1

This is exactly what a South Park game should look like, if it was a turn-based RPG. It is a custom adventure that feels like a movie and gives you certain freedom to explore the town of South Park and meet all of it's belowed and crazy characters.

"Game: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Score: 9/10 Recommended? Yes Worth a buy at full price? Yes  Overall a great game for old and new mgs fans alike, but don't expect the same story telling and the same long, artful cutscenes that you've been accustomed to: this game is more focused on gameplay, and the story is quite gimped compared to the other games in the series.  Pros: +Great introduction +Great TPS gameplay +Vehicles +Many customizations +Great deal of ways to approach any given mission +Buddies to bring into battle +Many hours of content +Open world +Difficult (if you avoid killing and reflex mode) +Great graphics +Awesome optimization (all high+extra high on GTX660 1080p@60fps)  Cons: -Gimped story when compared to other MGS titles -Reflex mode makes the game a joke for stealth -Forced multiplayer -Microtransactions -Slow, timed development of in-game items (similar to upgrading structures in clash of clans) -Bare, empty world -Weak boss fights -Some missions are repeated exactly with only a few extra challenges added to them  Conclusion: If you don't care for story and don't come from an MGS background, and like great graphics and gameplay, then this game is worth your money and time, and will be fun for you to play. If you were hoping for a great finale to the MGS series, you may be a little disappointed. All in all, a good buy, but definitely not '10/10' as IGN seems to put it. I'd say its more like an 9/10 for gameplay, and 7/10 for story.  EDIT: Now that Metal Gear Online has come out on PC, there's even more reason to purchase this game. I can comfortably say that the online mode was well worth the wait, and will be enjoyable to existing players of the game. Though it does have a few quirks here and there (such as a lack of push to talk and text chat for in game comms) it is still a very enjoyable experience. It is also NOT pay to win, as MB tokens are only for puchasing cosmetic items.  Score: 9/10 Worth a buy at full price? Yes",1

Even so, I lost count of the times that I finished this game. Why?  Because the plot captivated me. When I first heard of this game, I refused to know anything about it's plot so I could fully enjoy this world. I really thought it was a horror or mystery game. But then the plot started and I realised...it was so much more.  I'm shutting myself up before I give any spoilers. Like many people before me, I complain about the price. I complain about the legth of the gameplay. But If this game is on sale, buy it. You're not going to regret it.",1

The campaign is invigorating and the compromises you have to make to maintain power are unsettling. Overall good game",1

"Pretty funny game! Fun to play at school or short periods, but it gets very boring in the long run.",1
"If you've mastered Civilization V and you're looking for a new challenge, this is it. EL is basically a fantasy Civ V with additional/optional quests (including wall-of-text UI for hardcore fantasy trypes) and a rpg-like power-up mechanism for military units. Like Civ V, it's a solid time-sink.   My only gripe is that strategic and luxury resources are dumped on players in huge chunks (the first 'extractor' technology gives you 3 of them in one go, the second even 5 iirc), so you won't really pay attention to actual differences between them. Also the tutorial barely scratches the surface of the game... for example it doesn't cover the RPG-like upgrade mechanism. You should probably read the manual to figure out what you're doing, or play at Newbie level (which seems very hard to lose). Naval combat is pretty much non-existent, but regular combat is basically a small (and optional) tactical subgame in itself, which is deeper than anything you'll find in Civ V.",1

"I went into this expecting a 2d minecraft. What I got was a game where one minute I'll be deep in a cave, then suddenly I'll be in hell fighting giant worms made of bone and evil fire imps, then I'll teleport back to my base and start thinking of interior design suitable for my newly moved in nurse when suddenly I'll be notified that a goblin army is approaching from the west. After fighting them off I'll invite my friend to come into my world and help me defeat the Eye of Cthulu, and show of my new rocket boots to him.  This game has far more replayability than minecraft and I guarantee you, once you get into it all thoughts of Minecraft will fade into the distance, and you will be mesmerized by the diversity and general amazingness of it.",1
"I recommend this game for tower defense fans, and nobody else. Good balanced game; bit tedious; very bad presentation. In some respects this game is the best tower defense game I've played. I consider it to have flaws which diminish the fun. Tower defense: waves of enemies come, and you build static defense weapons to counter them. Defense Grid is a pretty basic tower defense: despite the appearances, enemies seem to be considered one-dimensional dots on a path; weapons always hit. There's a line-of-sight mechanic though, by which towers can't shoot through other towers, and some towers are higher than others, and the levels are considered in 3D for targeting. It isn't immediately obvious what the barriers for targeting are (some towers are considered lower than their model suggests, many can shoot steeper downward than their models can bend). That is the first weakness of the game: there isn't a direct correlation between what you see and what you get. Even the indicator for how far your towers can shoot seems not to precisely correlate to how far they can actually shoot. So now you can enjoy learning the actual capabilities of your weapons by heart. In some stages Defense Grid let's you build towers in the way of your enemies, so that you can make them take a longer route. Often you need to find the longest route to get a good result on a level; the second longest route won't do. They obviously did a lot of balancing to get the stages to work like that. Also the different weapons are well balanced with their costs. So that's one strong point: very subtly balanced game. Second strong point is the resource management. Keep your 'money' in the bank and you get interest. Very simple, but works  perfectly  for tower defense games. This is one of the points that makes it rewarding to go for a highscore. The towers don't take any orders, tweaks, or diverging upgrade paths. They will however automatically target enemies they're strong against, which is nice on one hand, but isn't very rewarding. A special class of enemies flies and takes a shorter route. Countering them boils down to saving enough money to buy a special AA-gun on time. It all works, but it feels a bit artificially scripted. For some reason you can't zoom out to see the entire stage at once. If an enemy slips by your defense, you will often not notice it immediately. The game has some checkpoints where it autosaves, so you can rewind the game as much as you like to one of those checkpoints. This is a must for getting good highscores. The enemies are shapeless blobs that could have been somebody's first 3D project. The stages look like the part of the background that you can't actually interact with in other games. There's only one BGM (that interactively changes mood). The sounds of enemies dying is either muffled, or sounds like one of your cannons firing. And you have some posh computer companion with a tragic backstory who tells you what to do. Many people seem to be ecstatic about the voice-acting and humor of that character; I found him annoying and overly dramatic.",-1
"This game sells itself. You can design your own theme park, and drown the guests who dont like it. What more could you possibly want from a game? ",1
"At 12 hours into the game I have almost completed my first playthrough. The whole game takes about 15 hours to complete, and, while short, they really couldn't have made it any longer, and here is why:  Game Mechanics: Hacking - Super frustraring when you are first introduced to it, but it gets more fun and easier the more you do it. Its a fantastic way to pick up some Xp, and to gather Money, Intel, and Dossier information. Fantastic mechanic well done.  Sneaking - Yes, yes, yes, ohmygod yes. Possibly the most simplistic sneak mechanic I have ever seen, and in its simplicity is where it shines. Hiding behind a wall works the way you think it would work. Being crouched under a window works the way you think it would work. Staying in the shadows WORKS THE WAY YOU THINK IT WOULD WORK! Everything is line of sight, and the AI is fantastic at dealing with that.  Sound - Breaking glass makes people suspicious or can downright alert them immediately. Sprinting will reveal your position to enemies due to how loud it actualy is. Throwing grenades, even mild ones will alert people in a very good area. And the enemies will talk to each other, so you better make sure you can shut someone up before they alert the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed compound!  Weapons - Not aiming is not suggested. Firing blind or in rapid succesion is more likely to alert the enemies around you than it is to actually kill the person you're trying to hit. All the weapons have thier advantages and disadvantages, Pistols have silencers, and can make for excellent stealth play, but they lack the rang to accurately hit a guard in a guard tower. SMGs are great for clearing rooms, but are terrible at actual combat. Shotguns, while great for single target and room clear do not work well against enemies spread across large areas, and large areas there are. ARs are all around good weapons, but the accuracy is terrible when firing in quick succesion.  Balance - Probably the best I've seen in a stealth game, or really any game. Even if you decide to go loud, and just gun down all the poor sods that in your way, you are not in a Call of Duty game. The weakest grunt will kill you in you get too close and he has a shotgun. Now, if you do go loud, but are not bent on attaining as much bloodshed as possible, it is more than likely you can make it out of a Taiwanese Embassy without ever disabling an alarm.  Over-all recomendation:  Buy it, play it, repeat. Its fantastic, and the graphics while not amazing, have stood up well against the test of time. This is not an FPS, it is a Stealth RPG. Eevrything you do effects the game, your choices will matter. Think of it as Mass Effect, if it was a stealth game.  Over-all rating: 9/10 10/10 Sneaking 8/10 Sabotage mechanics (Purely becasue it can get frustrating and slightly repetitive) 9/10 Gunplay 10/10 Story writing 10/10 Gut wrenching descions  Buy it, play it, expierience the life of a spy.",1

"Most of the other Atari collections have come up short, but this one seems to be comprehensive, and done with attention to detail. For instance, you select the different games by rotating through a lineup of either the arcade cabinets or video game boxes, both being historically accurate. There's also included scans of the instructions, and nice touches like being able to select between a modern options menu, and one that looks like the Atari 2600 switches (nice bit of nostalgia).  If there's any downside, it's that this doesn't really capture the range &amp; quality of the Atari 2600 library, but in all fairness, that's due to the fact that these are all games made by Atari, rather than 3rd party licensed games like ones from Activision (which was an *entirely* different kind of company back then). I'm obviously not faulting them for this, but I am naturally inclined to want to play those games now. That said, the game selection is really the best that Atari had to offer, and it's a fantastic lineup.  It was easy to get sucked in by the gameplay of classic arcade titles such as Centapede &amp; Asteroids. It goes to show the appeal that action-arcade games had back in the 70's &amp; 80's of very short, but fast paced intensity that uses a risk vs. reward system to encourage your skill level to determine your score. Speaking of which, there are leaderboards, both local &amp; worldwide, so you can see how terrible your skills of deterriated from age... Or maybe that's just me. Either way, this is a collection heavy on the nostalgia put together in a nice package. Worth picking up!",1
very great game i rly love it :),1
"Dota 2 has a rather large learning curve but don't let that put you off. You can start by playing against increasingly difficult bots and then play against other people. If you're new, the game will rank you against players with a similar skill level. Finding a group of friends to play with will really enhance the learning process and give you some good laughs.  The game itself is incredibly fun and there is always more to learn. Not only is the game free to play but all the heroes are too. The only items which cost any moeny are optional cosmetic items. The community can be unforgiving at times, however the game allows you to mute other players and lets you communicate via a series of informative 'pings' if you so choose. Anyone who is really offensive can be reported for their behaviour.  If you are looking for a game to play long-term, where you can have fun with friends but equally, see your time pay off with definite increases in your skill level, then this is for you. Go on, give it a go!",1

"  Platformers have it hard these days. There are seemingly hundreds of them being released each month with a large amount of them either being subpar or broken in some way. Browsing doesn’t seem to help since the sheer number of platforming indies on steam is completely overwhelming. It can leave you at a loss as where to start looking for a good one. Often, you view a page with some decent looking platformers only to find poor level design, broken controls, or levels so hard it’s just unsatisfying to bother playing. Lately, I mostly go off my friend’s recommendations.   A month ago, one of my favorite twitch streamers was playing Shu and tweeted how much she enjoyed the game and the art style. Since she’s known to be an excellent platform player I jumped at the chance to play Shu for a review. Now was my opportunity to see if I’d have the same reaction as she did. What I discovered was one of the best platformers I’ve played in 2016.    Gameplay First Impressions",1

"I'm mostly reviewing this to skew the results back to positive. This game does not deserve 'mixed', most 'mixed' games are absolutely terrible.  This game is awesome for someone that loves L4D, and it's set in a fantasy universe which is great.   Is there endless replayability? No, there's not in L4D either. It's just like the ARPG genre, you can add everything in the world to that genre, it will get old fairly quick.  My only major gripe is the lack of players, I think they're doing it right by making it free this weekend, but in the long term will there be enough people to get people to buy the game after the free week?   The lack of population isn't the game's fault, there's just not a lot of replayability and the fun is frontloaded (not a bad thing, you can get 100 hours EASILY out of this game).  Maybe consider free to play in the future and give current players some major benefits for originally supporting the game? That would make everyone happy (imo) since it will boost the playerbase a lot.",1

"The game must be amazing, but I'll never know it :( The game is glitching on my machine and many textures don't show (like I can't choose the type of landscape, I don't see water, including the flow direction, and I don't see borders and zones). Here's my config:   CPU:  Intel Core i3-4160  RAM:  8GB Dual Channel DDR3 1600MHz  GPU:  Intel Integrated Graphics Controller  What I can confirm is that the phrase 'Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards' is fully damn true.",1

"This one tugs at the heart strings, it does. Liked it much more than Bastion, which was itself a really good game. Didn't touch another game in my library until I'd completed this gem. Must play. Take the time to see, take the time to listen, take the time to feel.",1

Very good conversion so far in my opinion though am not a specialist I can feel the fun is close to my experience on dreamcast so I would say the purchase is quite worth it without saying that as having a deep knowledge of technical aspect. It's a nice conversion but I regret the missing optional first person view as some gamecube controller fonctions if this is the base of that pc version may not be available and I'm not totally sure about the quality of the optimisation.,1
"Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition is a fun little platformer that branches out mostly in the Nintendo area of consoles, but has come to Steam for a neat release as well. I personally quite like this game and its related franchise, as well as the developer company themselves, so fair warning, I may be slightly biased. Please don't let that deter you from purchasing this game, however!  Let's start with the gameplay. It plays well, and doesn't take much to run. The player controls one Patricia Wagon as she sets off to capture, capture, and capture again the Hooligan Sisters, making use of large blocks that switch in and out of the game's playing field, making up a majority of the puzzles and action in the game itself. The concept is relatively simple enough, and is put to use pretty well. Along with that is fairly standard platforming mechanics, with Patricia carrying a gun to shoot enemies with as well, altogether making a pretty good gameplay experience in my opinion.  As for graphics, this is a two-dimensional platformer that uses sprites, but it looks good. The version of this game on Steam and some Nintendo consoles titled Hyper Drive Edition feature redone sprites of most everything in the game, in a nice and smooth artstyle. There is an option to turn Patricia Wagon, and only her, back into the pixelated version seen in the first versions of the game.   In terms of sound and music, I very much like the soundtrack of Mighty Switch Force! Composed by Jake Kaufman, or virt, it's a lovely electronic mix soundtrack, and is available to download for free or pay what you wish on Jake's bandcamp. Admittedly I believe the sequel's music is ever so slightly better, but that can be found in the little spinoff game also present on Steam. As for the sounds themselves, overall the game has good sound design. Patty's voice doesn't get annoying, and the rest complement the actions that occur.  Overall, I find the game great, if a little short perhaps, but still worth the price! If you do purchase and do like this game, I recommend obtaining another entry into its franchise, Mighty Switch Force! Academy, also available currently exclusively on Steam. If you like this type of game, I'd also suggest looking into the Shantae franchise! If I missed anything, please leave a comment below. Thanks for reading, and if you do purchase this game, have fun!",1
Tropical Fish Shop 2 nice,1
"This game has some nice features, but there are too many little things that make the game hard to enjoy. Here are a few: 1, All turns are simultaneous with no way to disable it. (You and the AI take your turn at the same time.) 2, There is no 'custom faction' like one would think, but instead you can tweak that stats of a faction already in the game. 3, Combat is at best laskluster, and at worst frustrating.  4, There is little to no diplomacy",-1

"Well....first off the bad things, then the good: The camera is sometimes very ♥♥♥♥♥♥, blocking sight, very close to the ground, while you would need it farther away and it tends to rotate needlesly.  There are some heavy bugs, crashes on: loading, chat, saves, phase transition, although these bugs are rare, they still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. In 15 hours, there were about 10 of them. WAY too much for me...  The controls are quite bad, SOMETIMES making aiming an game of patience.  A whole ability tree is useless as it is heavly bugged. DO NOT ever skill anything with berserk. If berserker wears off, you won't be able to attack these targets anymore. This might ♥♥♥♥ your game up!  The endportal was invisible...which was somewhat of a fat blocker, as i moved around with my mouse to find it...-.-  Saving/Loading is somewhat bugged. whenever you do you will realise that the game saves specific values, but not everything. Movement range is reset in fights, sometimes even the initiative is ♥♥♥♥ed up.....  LOTS and LOTS of walking, AND they killed the speedup botton from the first game....which was the one feature i thought was great.   Now the good stuff: Its cheap. Its funny, if you get the references. Its challanging, on higher difficulty.   Overall i do not recomend this game in general. If you enjoy rpgs and share this fairly specific pop culture /gaming humor, yes this might still be a good game for you. If not, don't touch it.",-1

"Although the puzzles were sometimes clever, they were also disappointingly obvious most of the time and occasionally frustrating (see: first person platforming). It is often compared to Portal, but the comparison really only holds up to 1) It's a first person puzzle platformer and 2) the objective is to solve the room puzzle to advance. However, if you like the Portal genre, you'll get some satisfaction out of this.  The environmental effects when you change dimensions are very well done and were the highlight of the game for me. While I enjoyed my time with it, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to flesh out the true potential of this franchise.",-1
"Don't even try thinking about getting this game . The ''double drm'' uplay/steam makes it even worse . 9/10 times the game will not even launch , and if it does , 10/10 times you will crash .

"Excellent. I loved the game already in Alpha, now it's released it seems really well done, and awesome OST too.  Be carefull, Brigador looks like a heavy action game, but it needs some finess to actually not lose : it's easy to die, ammo are limited, objectives are clear, enemies are legion.  Some players nag about the controls, but after a little training it's really the best way to deal with that game, and all become very smooth, precise and fun. Now with options to change controls behavior.  A part i love about Brigador : the setting, the effort with art, visuals and sounds, the feeling whenever i start a mission, and the pace going from sneackly slow to alertly extatic, it's not only a shooter...   I hope you manage to get a successfull side project to refund your studio, and then go back to improve and extend the wonderful fundation you have built with Brigador.",1

"What I thought would be a spiritual successor to Cannon Fodder turned out to be a very dull 'bullet-hell' esque game, minus the things that make bullet hell games fun.

"Instead of writing a review, let me tell you a story. I recently had an online 3v3 match where I had to fight the Japanese, British, and the Spanish. Early on, my friend got attacked by the Spanish which left his empire severely crippled. He sent some villagers to settle next to my empire so we could attack together. Around the beginning of the second hour, we kept getting attacked by the Japanese, so we assembled large armies to push through. Soon enough, my navy and our armies destroyed the Japanese. We both settled in the area because the Japanese left a lot of resources around. Resources were scarce around midgame, so we set up small strike forces to chip away at the British empire. Soon enough, we lead an ambush on the British, attacking their buildings and razing their farmlands. We killed their army and destroyed their most important buildings, eventually causing them to surrender. Our last enemy were the Spanish. Led by Queen Isabella, she had armies of monks and conquistadors. We kept getting our asses destroyed by her forces, almost leading us to surrender. She had controlled most of the land, which would prove to be a challenge to us. It took us about 2 hours to destroy her navy and kill her conquistadors and monks. Soon enough, she surrendered, as we just toppled the largest empire on the continent and brought it to its knees. We won the match when the clock struck 5 hours. God I love this game.",1
"Earthbound 2: The Homestuck Fandom Needed Somewhere To Migrate is the story of a small child who falls into a mountain and makes the internet argue over what gender they are because that's the sort of thing the internet cares about. Along your journey you'll meet lovable characters such as:  Flower: A spooky flower that hates you and wants you to die Lady Goat: A nice goat lady who's kind of a ♥♥♥♥ to her ex even if he did murder a bunch of kids Sleepyblock: A sad ghost who makes music and puts it on Soundcloud Sammy: A wacky skeleton who loves puns and memes and speaks in the Jokerman font who may or may not want to kill you, depending on your actions Palbones: Sammy's brother who loves spaghetti and wants to be part of the boy band (that for some reason has females in it) The Royalboys™ Undertale: A scary fish who's actually just a cliché from Japanese cartoons that's only a cliché from Japanese cartoons because they think those Japanese cartoons are real Anime: A lizard who spends all day on Tumblr and builds a robot boyfriend to distract from the fact that their real crush (Undertale the fish) is too busy performing in her boyband with her dog friends to talk to Anime, that is until Anime's roboboyfriend runs away to join the circus and then Anime gets executed for her crimes against the Mountain People The Atomic Bomb: Anime's fancy cuboid robot boyfriend that joins the circus and turns into a real boy with the power of television Muscle Goat: Lady Goat's ex who killed a bunch of kids and is surprisingly nice for a serial child murderer Carmen Sandiego: Either an innocent child or literally Satan, depending on your view of the game Frugal: The human you play as, an empty vessel for your actions and a poor blind child from a charity commericial Cute Goat: The reason for my tears and best character in the game  [come back later and add a joke title before posting] is a really fun game filled with puzzles, food, dates and wacky characters that will probably effect you on an emotional level, unless it doesn't, in which case don't tell anyone because people will shout at you and call you a soulless freak even though there are literal soulless freaks in the game that they love.   If you like the game, you'll probably want to look at the fandom, a choice you will regret. Whether it's the terrible memes of Facebook, the terrible drawings of DeviantArt, the terrible rabid shippage, overemotional memes and weird ask blogs of Tumblr (the place Anime spent her time before she was executed), the [come back to here once you've googled what happens on instagram] of Instagram, the (relatively) high quality memes and cluster♥♥♥♥ian nature of the notorious hacker ♥♥♥♥♥'s famous message board or whatever Reddit does, there's one constant. Porn. Pornography on the internet, and lots of it. On all of these. Even Facebook, a site that doesn't allow nudity, has NSFW Under[word that isn't tale for comedic effect] pages.  TL;DR Undertale is an 8/10 niche RPG with weird semi-memetic humour and wacky characters that will either have no effect on you or completely change your life, depending on various factors that are all probably something.  But let's be real, it's been out for a year as of yesterday and if you haven't played it yet you probably never will. If you somehow still don't know what an Undertale is after all this time, you've been living under a rock, or perhaps a mountain (SEE WHAT I DID THERE IT WAS A COMEDY JOKE HAHAH LAUGH AT MY FEEBLE ATTEMPTS AT HUMOUR). If you've somehow not been exposed to it, go watch Vinesauce Joel's playthrough of it. If you somehow haven't been exposed to it, don't care enough to buy it and don't even care enough to watch someone else play it, then continue on with your life and feel free to never pay any attention to Undertale. Because contrary to popular belief (and the thing I said a minute or two ago,) it probably won't change your life in some amazingly profound way. It's just a video game people like.  It's 5:09AM and I'm very tired.  EDIT: Today I learned that Steam censors the name of a notorious image board but not the word pornography, which literally means 'printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate sexual excitement.'",1

One of the classics every steam library should have.Just dont buy it at full price wait until its on sale. ,1

Not much of a Star Trek fan.. but it's a free game and it seems like fun.  NEVER TURN DOWN A FREEBIE! :D,1
1 more hour should be alright...   right?,1
Classic great game still fun to play,1
It's GTA. It's the best GTA to date. Story is great. Characters are fun to play. the 'RPG-lite' aspects aren't grind-y feeling. The side missions all have a fun flavor to them. The online component is fun in both short bursts and long marathon sessions. Always something to do. Always entertaining.,1

"Update 01.03.16: No more updates, no DLC coming (it's console only), port is is a poor technical state and there's been nothing but silence from the devs. Don't buy.  After an awful launch and nearly 2 months of the developer showcasing incredible incompetence (which even includes a 15 gig patch that deleted save games for many), not to mention pretty much zero developer/publisher communication with the community and lotsa crappy DLC, on June 5 I can finally say that game has mostly been fixed and works well now, some sloppy netcode aside. Better late than never, right?   Should you buy it now? The best asnwer I can provide is... sorta. The actual game is pretty good and the awful port has been mostly fixed, but before you buy you should consider this: the developer and publisher have screwed up many times and in many creative ways over the last two months since it was released, so much so that with each new patch downloading I am still preparing myself for the worst.  Cautious recommendation at best. Great game locked inside a crappy port that's sorta fixed now but can be nuked again at any moment by a greedy publisher and a pathetic second rate third party developer.",-1
"Sigh Its not very often we come across stuff which is rotten yet you have to go through it for the sake of nostalgia and old times....Rambo the video game is just that , Now Compared to others this is a barely positive review score wise i would say 6/10.  As a whole game without the rambo backing This might be one of the worst unwanted crazy mixture of a mess video game , it never focuses on one thing ... stealth, F**king QTE , action, rpg like stats and perks, arcade style objectives such a crappy mess. Its like they formed different teams and each came up with a separate idea.   Just the fact that it uses all of the rambo history properly makes it a one time playable game , i have no idea about the co-op cant imagine asking someone else to join this torture.  Sigh that glorious moment when someday in the future we get a rambo game that plays like farcry 3 or fallout so many things rambo can do.  Breaking down the pros and cons  Pros  - Er they copied the rambo movies properly stock voices, music etc a few left out parts like the kid in afghan probably fearing outrage, so yeah it never happens in licensed movie games but this managed to keep most of the rambo trilogy as is.  - As a rail shooter the lack of free movement hurts but they captured the iconic parts of the movie and what rambo does in them properly so not missing out anything good.  - Decent progression skills and perks do make a significant change. Grab the one that skips QTE and the one that leeches life.  - The guns seem to work fine easy to fire for headshot counts.  - The game seems to be supported well , they just added more content free.   Cons :-   - Terrible gameplay its neither fish nor fowl, everything is thrown making a rage quit game to play.  - Horrible game engine lags hard at times , except for plastic shining rambo others hard to make out in the game  - Horrible difficulty curve not for newcomers. Even reloading is a pain.  - Waste of being a arcade rail shooter , it could taken sweeping change like the tomb raider reboot.  - Wrath mode is extremely important but that screen will give you seizures and headache.  If you want to suffer through a bad game after playing too many good ones or planning to do a awful game marathon this is cheap pop worth getting in a steam sale. Or grab the rambo trilogy film blu ray in a cheap yard sale.",1
  Impossible to update this game... 11/10,-1
"Funny enough, i've been waiting for a game like this. the storyline is slightly disappointing, but the gameplay itself was extremely beautiful beyond thought,",1
"The pros and cons of Dementium II HD with detailed story  /lacking/ Story: Mental paitent goes to ward, ward does brain surgery, brain is super brain and unleashes spooky things, survive. PROS This is a great port considering it's from the Nintendo DS Smooth gameplay This isn't really a scary game but more of just a dark/creepy exploration game (which is good!!) Combat and boss fights are generally smooth and fun Fun puzzles without game ruining difficulties! Seriously, the adventure is so fun, I love the exploration CONS Still generally misleading content Getting lost/not knowing what to do can happen frequently Some simple enemies are difficult Lacking story Somewhat of an eye sore graphically OVERALL GRADE 8/10 Horror games don't have to scare you to be good, sometimes it's better to explore the spooks than them be thrown at you.

"I like this game, and even more after I finished the normal level (nightmare level campaign)! Yeah",1
"hitman: absolution is hard (but of course can be played in an 'easy' mode for a quicker run-through) - really fun - it looks beautiful and it's addicting ! what makes it greater than other 'hitman' games in the series (for me at least - and probably very few others) is that they've FINALLY made it gamepad accessible! in fact, that's the main reason i bought this particular game. i'm just not a mouse/keyboard kind of guy.  anyways, i absolutely recommend this game. i found it really, really well done. and kudos to their gamepad enable abliity at long last! agian, it looks amazing and the controls feel genuinely smooth. the scenarios are captivating enough and it's a fun challenge to try getting though them without killing anyone = sneaking. this is one of the better, worthwhile games i've ever played and remains my favorite in the series.",1
Killed barbarians and much fun was had. 10/10 would recommend.,1
"I followed this series back in 2009 (starting from EBF 1) and am still following it.  This game was first introduced on a flash game website and to have it ported to my personal PC is the nicest thing to have.  The game is a simple RPG with a linear story line. Tons of unique (even fanmade!) monsters as well as an abundance of costumization for your characters to use. Each enemy has their weakness and each character is good at dealing certain types of damage or being a certain type of 'stereotype' role.  Epic Battle Fantasy is a homage to your good ol' JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game) and features a keyboard usage as well as mouse usage, depending on what your preference is. The EBF series also has a lot of connections (and easter eggs!) with Japanese stuff related, especially anime.   For those who want a simple, yet fun RPG with tons of references to anime, J-games, this game will be fun for you!  The creator is also creating on a sequel of EBF 5 and spin-off bullet hell versions. Also check out EBF III, the prequel of this game! :D",1

To say the least it's addicting. I love the game.,1

Super Fun! I saw a commercial for this game while I walked into a Rent-A-Center. I got back home looked at it and purchased it on sale during the steam sales and it was worth it!,1

"Before I bought this game, I was in the impression by its ad and medias that this game will be as good as GTA 5, at least closer to it. After I finished its main story, I realized that it is a big game, the developer's work worth its price, but my impression shrunk into its quarter. So, if you played GTA 5 before or you are in the the impression that this game will be as good as GTA 5, do not play it. If you don't mind that, go ahead, have some fun. After all, it is a brilliant idea to let player have some sort of hacking experience.",-1
"Let me start off by saying this: This is a fun game. It can keep you busy for awhile and has an okay amount of things to do. It's visually appealing and it's an idea that isn't really used that often, or hasn't been as big as it is in this game.  Now then, That above statement does not justify the $60 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars you have to pay to play this game, NOT counting any of the DLC that's practically going to be required for you to play in the future. This game is not even worth the $60. It gets repetative fast, and only has 2 game modes, which is STILL THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING GAME MODE, only 1 lasts 5 matches and the other lasts 1.  No one can ever justify the price of this game. It's severely overpriced and I hope the developers/publishers go bankrupt for trying to screw over the consumner in this sense.",-1

"Bully is a good game on Wii, Xbox 360 and PS2 but the pc port is a terrible transition. It isn't on the levels of Dark Souls' port or Resident Evil 4's port but there are quite a few issues that has made me more focused on them rather than the actual game and it's content. Here are the problems that rouble the PC port of bully and I'm gonna do something a bit similar to what I did with my Dark Souls review. I will upload a review of the console version of bully on metacritic but here on steam, I'm gonna focus on the pc's issues. I will put in the metacritic link here when I get it written: For now here are the issues on the PC version:  PROBLEM 1: Poor mouse and keyboard support. I know that Bully has rebindable keys, but even if u rebind them, the controls will still be a mess. Running around will be awkward and you will find yourself running into walls and run into something when running around a corner. Controls are the worst when you're on a bike. Bike controls are similar to that of GTA SA's bike controls but add in the bad controls of the gameplay when you're on foot but imagine you're on an ice rink. When you make a turn, your bike will turn and possibly knock into something because the camera's hard to control and it will also veer into another direction and crash into something else.  PROBLEM 2: Frame rate dips. Bully's frame rate ended up dippping into the 10's and sometimes into the single digits when I was performing certain actions and they did this throughout the whole game and they dipped alot when I wa indoors especially.  PROBLEM 3: Missing environmental textures. Some textures throughout the environment (especially in the alley areas) are either missing nd have a white bloch in it's place, have an incorrect colour tint to it or are poorly textured and make it look like the developers snotted on the camera.  PROBLEM 4: Frame rate locked. The frame rate was locked t 30 fps, a common problem that I've seen popping up repeatedly when I talk about bad porting. I have had a few friends say that they were able to get the game to 40 fps, but they needed to go into the game's files and delete all of the environment's shadows in it's file in order for it to get 40 and that still isn't a much better frame rate. Even after doing this, my friends still said they had repeated dips in frame rate into the single digits, even with the shadows deleted.  Bully is a very good game on all of the other systems other than the PC. Bully isn't the worst port in history but it still isn't a good port.

I feel like a tourist in New York! nice game :),1
Burned all AI player and they never get angry on you :D,1
this game is absolutly amazing. definatly the best FPS in a while. slashing through enemies chopping them to peices. saw two rabbits humping. tried to kill itgot a demon rabbit attacking me. very comical. lots of little secrects around in each level.,1

"It's wonderful game to acknowlege World War in 1914-1918, the history facts and playful design mix well. Usually you need to find ways to the puzzles or trobules, and of course you have to find answers in web. In general, this game is made to everyone who would like puzzle and history of 1st World War. The end of game is so impressive that you may become a anti-war man.   Weakness: 1. some game bugs, and you have restart the game 2. a few collections hard to find, though collecting them is interesting   ",1

"I wish I could support this game anymore. I played during Payday 1's beta, I played during the first Wolf Pack, I played during the Payday 2 Beta, owned pretty much every DLC.  Double-dipping, as Overkill has done, has removed any urge for me to continue the series or acquire/experience any other possible Overkill games. When your game is supported almost entirely on constant, paid DLCs, the audacity to include new microtransactions a la TF2 and CS:GO (the crate/keys system) shows a complete disregard for the playerbase.  In the fallout after the announcement of microtransactions, Overkill did not treat the community either with respect or with professionalism. Their words, essentially, were that microtransactions - and dozens of cheaply made paid DLC - were necessary for the game, even though datamined information showing Payday 2's revenue proved otherwise.  With regards to gameplay, the game used to be quite fun, though power-creep due to DLC has caused many of the defaut loadouts and experiences to be suboptimal.   The music is nice. Thanks, Simon.    RIP Payday 2.",-1

"*sigh* Okay, I'm sorry but there just isn't enough to merit this being it's own game nor is it anywhere near enough new stuff to be asking 39.99 and frankly even if you own Cities XL (which I do) it's not even worth being called an expansion pack for 19.99 price after that. Honestly I thought I had booted up the Cities XL when I first ran it. This is just an absolute cash grab and I'm sorry I pre-ordered this game since it was already in my library under the name Cities XL.",-1
"I like this game. It's a chill experience that I can just turn on and off everyday and not feel an overwhelming pressure to play but at the same time feel engaged enough to say I had fun. In the beginning the feeling when you find everything for the first time is great. Your first several planets feel very personal to you, even more so if you name them. It's a cool feeling that you are the first person ever to be there, unexplored territory that not even the developers know about. Of course this feeling doesn't last forever as the more you get acquainted with something the less effect it has but the initial experience was great. Though the game isn't super in depth and packed with content I like it for what it is now and with only a tiny bit of modding I get what I want from the game. I'm sure there will be more added to it in time, mods will get better too and after such I'll probably give it another play through in the next galaxy but as it is once I get to the center of my current one I'll likely retire.",1
My favourite game ever!,1
Boring and tedious.  Could waste time playing solitare or minesweeper and stil have more fun.,-1
"It's easily arguable about how 'brilliant' this game is, and people do. Some shame you if you don't get the point of it, or appreciate what makes it 'genius'. The others berate you for being so interested in what makes this game what it is.  I find it hard to give it any pros or cons, because in the end, it really depends on who you are. This game is about obsessive behavior, and what caused it and stemmed from it. It's a short game, and even when you stop to inspect it piece by piece, it won't take you very long. If you're like me, and feel relatable to behaviors of the character, you'll do your best to linger and try to derive insight from it to use for yourself.  If you have the time to sit and ponder for two or less hours, you'll probably enjoy this game. That's really the only way to play it--it's all about trying to figure out what exactly it's all about.",1
DO NOT SPEND 50 DOLLARES ON THIS like i did it crashes evrytime made me hate the franchise i loved dead rising 1 and 2 then this comes along the story line was sick but it was boring even with a couple friend not worth 50 more like 20 0r 30,-1

Game is thought prvoking and fun ,1
This game is just beautiful and the narrator's voice is just enchanted so as the music. This game is very replayable because of how hard and challenging this game can really get and the level design is just beautiful 10/10,1
this is the best thing released in 2016.,1
"Now that I got it to work properly. It's a decent little (40gigs!) MMO with a very unique setting. Namely, modern day. It's a refreshing break from the high fantasy stuff that flood the MMO market these days. The game is full of Lovecraft lore and references and I enjoy that immensely. Again, the only thing I can say is make sure you know your Steam password as you are required to log in to your Steam account on the their website to link your SW account to your Steam account.",1
"Great game,short but great...every cent worth it.  Thanks Dev´s for make this game :)",1
Ok. So ive played TONS! of games but this has to be my favorite. The soundtrack is AMAZING! and the lore and character development is amazing! If you are thinking about getting this then i HIGHLY recamend that you buy or take a look at the soundtrack. I PROMISE you won't be dissapointed. Overall I have spent $20 dollars on this game and it has become my favorite game. WAIT! Don't leave yet cause i have to tell you the MOST important thing... DO NOT! SPOIL THE GAME FOR YOURSELF! It is amazing and you don't know how much of the game i ruined for my self by watching gamethory and other sources (such as the reddit) Even if you do it still is amazing   Why its good.  1.Best soundtrack 2.One of the best plots 3.SO MANY THINGS TO DISCOVER AND 4 ENDINGS! bonus. If you buy this game legends say you can drink juice from the legendary Goat Mama   ,1
Overall not a bad game. Feel slightly cheated that the DLC are only compatible with Windows.,1
10/10 would get impaled on a tree branch again.,1
"In all honesty, this game isn't half bad. The amount of replayability this game gives is astonshing for how negative the reviews are and how little people play this game. The only con I can see in this game is that there aren't a lot of maps to play on and gameplay can get stale pretty easily.",1
"Regarding on storyline (pandemic outbreak) it's almost realistic. I even saw a man masturbat!ng behind the garbage truck.   11/10 game is so so good, would splat my sem3n all over the safehouse.",1
A really scary game for a cheap price! I watched Markiplier play this and i thought to my self i need to play that! And it is really freaky! I give the game 2 thumbs up for everything! =),1

"It's time for the second round of  Higurashi ! *applause, screams* For those who are squeamish, this chapter in the rural murder mystery can be pretty graphic in descriptions of torture and violence. Now that that delightful tidbit is out of the way, this arc is important for providing us with several keys to the mystery. Some background on Hinamizawa is given, along with details about the worship of Oyashiro-sama. Random fact: in the Shinto religion, the spilling of blood is considered a form of pollution and unclean. Now, this part is creepy enough for Americans, but to the Japanese, this is pretty much blasphemy a la  Children of the Corn . Fun fact over.   The girl of this route is Mion, the game club leader, and we are introduced to her twin sister, Shion, which provides an answer to the question of   how Mion knew Keiichi met with Oishi at the Angel Mort restaurant  . Along the way, we learn about the history of the Sonozaki family's role in Hinamizawa, and get an interesting glimpse at a character we barely got to know in  Onikakushi-hen . It's rather...interesting. Can you figure out what is going on?  So, this arc brings up some interesting questions about just what is going on here. Just wait until we get to the corresponding Answer Arc,  Meakashi-hen . It's a doozy.        ",1

Great game even for people who haven't played any of the other games. You might be confused in some parts but there are audio recordings you can listen to for help and also there's youtube.,1
This game is for people who like to sneak around and murder people just like the Assassin's Creed series and also like the Lord of The Rings and Hobbit Trilogies. This game in a nut shell is a Lord the Rings themed skin of Assassin's Creed. In my opinion I would buy this game over any of the Assassin's Creed games.,1

"Don't get me wrong, I've been following this game from the very start of its building process. Sadly, as we all feared, it has gone downhill somewhere in its release and partnerships with different companies along the way. Be it the cash shop system being extremely unfair towards other players, to the horrible performance and hacking issues... to the nearly unplayable lag rushes the game gets more often than it should, ToS turned out to be a lot of shattered hopes and dreams of an awesome re-enacting of what Ragnarok Online was, purely from things that should have been fixed along the way. Like with everything Korean-made that reaches our game markets, performance, balance and lag issues is a hit or miss; And for now it's a severe miss. Only time will tell if they manage to at least make it bearable.   Edit 7/21/2016:  After giving the game a serious investment, I have concluded that - while many if not all of the complaints I had to begin with remain there. - the artwork, music and customization of your character class do live up to what Ragnarok used to inspire. In fact, I can now affirmatively state it feels like an appropriate step up from it. What makes me change this review to a positive is one grand thing most MMOs as of late never, ever apply anymore; The game actually brings challenge to you without having to reach anywhere near the middle of the game. This actually makes someone like me, frustrated by the casualization and outburning of MMOs turning everything into a push to win simulator, actually have a blast having to use more than one neurone at a time.  All in all, if you are willing to go into this game knowing it is a gem mishandled by the publishers that will take a while to be properly polished, and keep yourself in the proper mindset for it - you will have fun.",1

"Fall of 1993 saw the release of two video games that were as different as night and day but shared two things: they both had four-letter names and they would both absolutely dominate the field until  Half-Life  came along a half-decade later. Of those two games,  Doom  was unmistakably the night,  Myst  the day.  Doom  coursed with motion.  Myst  held the gaze with its clarity.  This clunky 3d port is a sad echo of that original and does practically nothing to convey the shocking sharpness of the 1993 version. Whereas the old slideshow version was confined to a now inconceivably small window, it did push the limits for its time and rarely overplayed its hand. This one is full of bad texture-mapping and barely passable lighting. Compared to the loving upkeep the  Half-Life  series has received in recent years, this hackneyed conversion is just painful to witness.  (Regarding the gameplay—it's almost inevitable that the puzzles in a game so far ahead of its time would age badly, but generally  Myst  has done better than could be expected on that front. Compared to its first sequel,  Riven , the structure feels more than a little contrived, but the puzzles are reasonably well balanced between codes, mazes, and mechanical mysteries.)",-1
"Soma fluently explores the semantics and implicit beliefs about what it means to be human, and its graphic portrayals of the potential catastrophic risks of superintelligence help to illuminate the whole setting. If you’ve ever enjoyed any work by Nick Bostrom, Robert Heinlein, Max Harms, Dan Simmons, or if you’ve ever taken an interest in artificial intelligence, transhumanism, uploading, whole brain emulation, or the theoretical compulsion to 'optimise for paperclips', you should play this game.",1

"Well it's free-to-play now but it's still not fun-to-play. The radar they give the hunters makes all sorts of previous monster meta impossible (good luck doubling back or setting ambushes) and only serves to enable baddies who can’t play the trapper role properly. They even let every class dome now which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. It’s not fun to play monster anymore and beating monster is way too easy so you get no satisfaction out of putting down a good wraith/goliath player. There is no way this game is going to garner a respectably sized playerbase as long as it continues to pander to low-skill players, especially not when TF2 competitive and Overwatch are around.   It blows my mind that 2k studios was able to ♥♥♥♥ up something as simple as going free to play but there you have it. Go play something else instead.",-1
"Your typical point-and-click, find-the-hidden-item game with occasional mini-games scattered within. Nothing to take seriously, but a great way to burn a couple hours.

I enjoyed myself for the first few minutes, until I got to the 'goblins in heat' sidequest. Your character's a nerd, so of *course* he's desperate enough to screw anything.   I'm not inferring anything. That's what he flat-out says.  I was hoping that kind of 'humor' wasn't characteristic. I was disappointed.  Play something better.",-1

Gone are the powerhouse moves of ice and steam, both helped you get through the game with very powerful combos now they sit as some of the weakest elements.  the general polish of the game has slipped, little things add up to alot, i miss being able to tell what armour level i has by its colour and the pinging noise when a rock was fully charged, these little attention to details seem to have been cut from this magicka.  the 'artifacts' that modify the game are nothing more then simple modifiers like 'enemies hit harder' 'wizards are burned more' 'X does the Y with Z added' not very flavourful or inventive.  lastly i couldnt find any staffs that didnt somthing cool, all the staffs i could find where 'Boost X but hamper Y' nothing fun like lightning immunity or summoning zombies to be found so far.",-1
"I got this game via the Humble Store Spring Sale for something like $5. It was worth twice the price. It was fun and compelling. It's also pretty short, but there are lots of community made 'modules' available. I recommend this game for some quick fun in a turn-based, cyberpunk/fantasy, strategy game.",1
fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things,1
The Possibilities are endless with Garry's Mod. Aswell as the varrious gamemodes. Great game.,1
Destroyed the last bit of sanity and mental balance in my head. 10/10,1
"this game is one of my games i play the most. its a little hard, but once you learn to play it, it's really fun!",1
"When in game you have a chainsaw, you know it's good :D   10/10",1
It's definitelly an interesting game. Balanced ships. Good visuals. Diverse combat mechanics.,1
"Although very similar to terraria, it's nothing like it.   This game is atleast   tenfold   more expansive than terraria not only proven with game size, but with immersive gameplay and   seemingly   endless worlds to explore, the vast content provides a refreshing experience each time, and gives learning from mistakes a whole meaning itself, and since its based on such a large scale, I hope this game continues to expand and become bigger.  10/10 is definately schwifty",1
Worst game on PC.  Stay away from this game. I wish there was a refund.,-1
"If you were planning on buying Fallout New Vegas (or were simply considering it), then I recommend you go for the GOTY edition instead of stock Fallout, as FNV: GOTYE comes with all of the DLC for much cheaper, and the DLC is a lot of what made this game so fun.  So for the rest of this review, I am going to assume that you have not gotten any of the DLC. Let's roll.  Fallout: New Vegas is a first person shooter RPG and the sequal to Fallout 3. In the game you play as a courier in the city of Las Vegas after a nuclear war. On your way to deliver a mysterious package which was turned down by the previous courier, you are captured by a thug named Benny, who steals your delivery before shooting you in the head twice and burying you. Somehow, however, you manage to survive the gunshot wounds to your cranium and are dug up by a robot named Victor and brought to a doctor in goodsprings. This is where the game begins. As the doctor goes through your medical exam, you get to customize your character to your liking, changing their looks, stats, and starting abilities. As you progress, you come to your first decision in the game, where an escaped convict named Joe Cobb threatens Goodsprings because they are holding someone inside the gas station who Joe wants dead. You are given the choice between joining the powder gangers or holding up a defense against them in goodsprings, or even leaving the whole incident alone. The game has a load of weapons, armor, and items to collect, and many different character and faction builds. From what I have gathered, there are 4 different main endings, followed by an explaination of what happened to all of the other characters and locations you met during your journey.  Overall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone.",1
"This is a really underrated game. Overall good story, and the best part is your an octopus wearing a tie. What's not to enjoy? Controls are a bit hard to get used to, but the humor makes up for it.",1
"its a good game i have to say,but mulit seems somethingwrong in my place.",1
"If you liked BioShock 1 &amp; 2, this game is amazing! Similar to the last two but so much more.",1
"YES I LOVE THIS GAME!! WHERE THE HELL IS MOUNT AND BLADE TWO???? THEY ARE SAYING ITS SUPPOSED TO BE COMING OUT SOON, BUT I NEED IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Great game! Batman meets Assassins Creed.,1

Hey that's pretty good!,1
"Poorly scripted, buggy, and frankly pointless.",-1
"I enjoyed   Far Cry  , it's a good ol' classic romp,    across a mad evil-scientist's desert island lair; the classic videogame tropes don't end there      In terms of graphics issues mentioned by other posters. I managed to run the game on the highest settings, although I did get a black screen the first time around. I dropped the water quality down one notch from ultra-high and after that it seemed to start-up fine. So it's worth playing with.  I did have a few issues with NPC's firing through walls, but not that often, maybe two or three times along a full play-through. Once I had to just jump into a 4wd and speed off to the next encounter as there was no way to kill them.  Although it probably is a little more difficult than more recent FPS's, Medium didn't feel like too bad a difficulty to play with. But I had to use all the tools at my disposal.   Using the binoculars to surveil the next target location, ahead of engaging visible enemy troops helped to work out true numbers (even through soft cover); as well as making them appear on the mini-map. Also the NVG'ish Goggles (Cry Vision on the Keyboard Mapping) helped to assess and take out targets' before they saw me.  All in all, it was well worth a play through and I'd definitely recommend picking up a copy, especially if it's on sale. Enjoy.",1
best RTS hands down,1
the most addictive / annoying game ive ever played,1
After finishing this game I was so emotionally drained I just sat and watched through all the credits. This game has quite possibly the best story in any game ever not to mention the best art style and premise. I would recommend anybody and everybody to play this masterpiece of gaming design.,1
The original 5 games are a must play if you don't mind old graphics.,1
This game is fun. Especially the raid mode. I would recommend if you are a fan of resident evil 4.,1
The best in the world (IT HACKS ME I LIKE IT BECUASE THE HACK LETS ME NOT HALF TO EMAIL OR PASWORD!!!!!!!),1
There is no suport or anyway to make a account so you can play it. a 100% fail in my book... Cant play it or find a page online that work so you can find a way to play it... If I was steam I would take this game off.. One more thang... I would red ♥♥♥ this game due to its ploy to gamers that this game is some kind of wonder when it clealy dos not work in anyway except to load it and instal it and have it do nothing.. It make me wounder what it is doing to my computer if I can not play it... Sins I have put this game up on my computer I have had to remove some unwanted programing that has been messing about on my computer... It took me a full day to get rid of this but what ever right.. One red flag and a not go from me... thanks but no thanks...,-1
"One of the best Action RPGs i've ever had the pleasure to play. It's grisly combat system, deep customizable skill tree, strong item economy are only some the aspects that lend itself to heaps and heaps of replay value. Did i also mention its free?",1

How to ♥♥♥♥ everyone off in a server. Step 1: Join a new beginner server. Step 2: Weld every door shut. Step 3: REALLY weld every single weldable door shut.

Repeat Steps 1 to 5. :),1
Currently having a lot of fun with this game reminds me of Rayman Origins the narrator and the art style really make this game interesting to play. I haven't even scratched the surface of the level editor and coop play yet.,1
"A huge improvement from its predeccessor, Dead Space 2 proves to be an amazing horror game with tons of jumpscares which leaves the player cautious when walking around the eerie spaceship. The gameplay is really good and the controls are easy to use (Xbox 360 controller). The music that they add during gameplay really adds up to the creepy atmosphere, and it makes it feel like as though necromorphs could jump out at you at anytime. This game is a definite must to pick up for any horror game fans out there!",1
"This is game unplayable in its current state. The obstacles are occasionally unavoidable, the slow down effects of hitting the obstacles sounds like crap, the power move pauses the music, and the 'remix filters' make the music unlistenable. Not to mention the ugly visuals, and I cannot currently reccomend this game.",-1
Love it been playing for 2 weeks with a friend on expert and we are at the moon lord,1
Exactly what I was wanting from a Diablo style game.,1
"Its a good game,does not have the best story but the gameplay is fun. 7.3",1
"Great writing, nice storyline, you get easily dragged into it and the lines are amazing. 10/10, it deserves it, one of the better games i played.",1
This game is amazing. Please buy this game if you have any sense.,1
"The Ship, the only game where you can play as Kim Jong-Il, kill George Bush, Fidel Castro and Osama...  Then die of social anxiety",1
cool game to waste the odd 1hour here and there on hope updates come as you can add so much stuff into this game £1.39 well spent,1
The game diablo III should have been. In this game it genuinely feels like you are crafting your own character with a deep and diverse charater tree which allows a wide variety of builds. The only major issue is the always online component which has fragged 2 hardcore characters thanks to lag spikes.,1
One of the best games I've ever played.  Pure fun :),1
"Very fun game. I don't play it anymore though, I'm sort of retired. I only played this when I was in an anticlimatic state of not being able to see a kid that I big brothered over because he moved. Oh ♥♥♥♥ it's coming back, NO NO! NOT THE ANTI CLIMATIC DEPPRESION! NO! NO! But yeah totally get this game, it's really creative and a great learning experience for 8 year olds-Stinky Youtube guys playing it from their suggestion box, I rate it!",1
Short but sweet. A mixture of puzzle solving with a bit of arcade action thrown in. Fortunately the arcade sections aren't too tough and are they often depend more on strategy than button clicking skills.,1
exploderize: the game,1
i love it it have custom you can make they so fuh\,1
Live action brilliance!,1
"Like PAYDAY:THE HEIST, but with a 2. -IGN  1\10",1
"So much fine. Had to dig up my music library MP3's though, been awhile. I didn't expect this game to be as fun as it is.",1
"Update may have stopped the third clip from starting. Not sure why it wouldn't load this time, only difference is the update. Very impressed, the immersion level is amazing, everyone who I've had try it gets shocked a bit as it does feel like your underwater. For $10 I am hoping we see more from future updates, I have an R9 390 AMD gpu and 4.5 ghz i5 but still get some dropped frames, graphics are impressive indeed but would expect smoother play through as your basically witnessing more than interacting. Would I spend $10 again knowing the content included and guarantee we will see more in the future, definitely, without the possibility even known, well then I don't know. Wouldn't refund it though, it is great to show the Vive off.",1
"the 3 matches I was able to play was a lag fest, super sonic speed melee fest rather than a cover based tactical shooter. 0/10. Least I got my refund",-1
Great game ever!  10/10,1
"Great game, the successor of Brink, last and also brilliant game from SD!  I'm a big fan of Brink with more than 1000h in multiplayer and I can say that Dirty Bomb made a lot of quality stuff from the Brink in a different way, adding that many unique innovations and dynamics, and an excellent team play what is nowhere seen before in any game!!!  Fantastic job Splash Damage!",1
"To quickly sum it up, its not worth the buy.  MANY WAYS TO KILL Sure there are many ways to kill people, but you will have a hard time luring them into these places and will end up relying on simple ways to kill people like poisioning coffee or food or drag a defib aroudn with you shocking everyone.  HEALTH SYSTEM For some odd reason you get health out of toilet bowls... like seriously devs being that more than 3/4 of the game takes place in a ♥♥♥♥ing hospital you didn't think of finding medical kits lying around or something better than a ♥♥♥♥ing toilet!!!!!! Jeez guys.  CUTSCENE FRAMES Even on a superb rig you can go from steady 60 frames to almost 11 as every cutscene locks the frames between 10 and 18 (I tested multiple times with a frame counter)  *SPOILER ALERT* (No need to worry ) - END OF THE GAME  I actually enjoyed the game up until the very end even with all these very weird things and bugs/glitches, corruption of saves, etc. and then you have to shoot a fire hydrant to knock the shotgun out of some dead nurses hand that is just frozen in time and then load salt shells into it to kill your brother. It is now one of the worst endings to a game in my book.  TRICYCLE  Seemed very pointless except for the first mission in Ludlow.",-1
rage than fun f**k,1
dont buy it ssf4 arcade is on steam buy that its the same price and now i regret buying this one instead of the other ,-1

"A good game with beautiful graphics, although the grinding is really strong it rewards you with tons of guns, melee weapons, Warframes and lots of other stuffs. It is one of the better Free2play games right now and doesn't need any money to be spend on to be good. You just need a lot of time... like really A LOT of time.",1
"Greatly enjoy playing this game. I'm not too adept at shooters of any kind, nor am I overly familiar with the popular games nowadays. I got it during Summer Sale because it looked like X-COM without all the effort. Super glad I got it.  By the way, Mac gamers, I'm running Bootcamp and it runs about 20% better in Windows than in OS X (Mavericks). Not sure why, I'm sure someone out there does.",1
"This game is amazing in my own opinion, It really describes psychological trauma really well and whys to deal with it. I am actually doing a series on youtube right now on the game so go check it out if you'd like.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvMW4Y0o0OU ",1
"Thanks to the wonderful workshop, I replaced: The Smoker with Snoop Dogg who's maui waui was too strong for me to handle.

The Charger with Wreck-It-Ralph who charged at us while all we could hear was, 'I came in like a wrecking ball'. My Flashlight with a picture of Barack Obama.

"Yet another reason why people shold NEVER EVER pay for a beta. As long as we keep paying (me included) developers for half finihed products we are gonna keep getting more and more crap. A Beta used to me something that was almost finished, just missing some tweaks and such. Nowadays u should be happy if the piece of crap even starts. This game is so bad that it actually hurts my feelings a bit. i wish i could just delete it from my inventory so im not constantly being reminded of the fact that i actually payed money for this..... Imagine buying a car for a little bit of discount just to realize that ur missing the steering wheel and parts of the engine and everytime you honk the horn the doors open. ",-1
Space combat more cumbersome than fun. Away missions are okay. There was a lack of excitement.,-1
"Is this game worth 20€? no never. Is it worth 4€? I suppose since thats almost the price of a sandwich here. This game is incredibly mediocre but you can have a few hours of fun with it, but this game will go down hill the longer you play it because it tries too hard to add more 'new unique features' by pretty much every 2-3 missions and you only get to use this feature once or twice afterward (except for tedious sidequests) before you get introduced to a new one. Making the game one long tutorial. The combat can be fun, but its pretty much just a Batman Arkham Asylum ripoff thats worse. so you might aswell just go play that instead. ... Also the story is absolutely awful.",-1

Lots of things to keep you hooked in the game, so make a mosh pit and go to war.  10/10",1
"I brought this when it was for sale, 79c. I was unsure on which agricultural simulator to buy, i ended up buying this one because it didnt seem too old to be out of date, nor too new to be all buggy. It was also because at the time of buying this, there was only one negative review, and, thats all the reviews there were. One. So i went and brought this i thought i should try and write a helpful review about my experience on the game.  Oh, and dont be decieved by the very low amount of game play i have, its just because steam and this game dont want to cooperate, but i have had more gameplay than just a couple of minutes.  Took awhile for me to luanch it when i first did, but it luanched. Upon first viewing's at the main screen, it seemed that this was gonna be a laggy game; but i fixed that by tweaking some of the options later on.  Being a new player to Agricultural simulator and this type of simulator as a whole, i had no idea on how to start playing, how to play, what everything was etc. But through further playing and investigating, by the time of writing this review i have a well good understanding of how the game works.   As mentioned earlier, the game was laggy. When i got into actually playing it was laggy, but not so laggy that i couldnt see where i was going or what i was doing, but, yeah, still laggy. So i went and fixed that; problem solved.  For a game made in 2012, the graphics seem fine to be, then again im not picky about that stuff. When i turned down resolution in the options i completely changed the look of the game from the screenshots in the store page. But it isnt that big of a deal, i can still see everything i need to see fine.  So once i fixed all of that stuff, i figured its time to start playing. You start from the ground up; you have to buy all of your recources and equipment that you use, e.g: manure, tractors, equipment, livestock. It's all G though, you start of with plenty amount of money to buy all of the items that you need and want.  One thing that i noticed while playing that bugged me a little, was that while driving in the tractor, it tends to turn a bit while you drive. Not a lot, but, its worth keeping your eyes on the road.  Your equipment can get worn, dirty and damaged. You have to refill the refillables; petrol, fertilizer. It's a simulator so you have to keep an eye on that stuff.  You can hire people to work on your farms, giving them set tasks etc. This is cool that you dont have to do all the work by yourself. And it gives me something to honk my horn at as i pass by. Yeah. You can honk your horn, aswell as use a parking brake to do some sick turns and some lights for safety. Not that they need the lights though. While i was hotdoggin around experimenting with the game i saw a car driving on the road, i was in a tractor. I wanted to ram him and squash his car. Instead i just drove right over it. No damage to the car :(, but i did after that find another car on the road and pushed him off the road. . . . but the prick just drived calmly back on.  So thats some of the stuff you can do if you want to go hotdoggin.  There are no objectives, missions, main goals etc. Its completely your choice. You wanna make a farm first, you can do it, or you can buy some livestock. Whatever you want to do. This is also a little bit of mustard on your hotdog though, for me as i was new to this, i had no idea what to do or how to do it, and the stuff in options controls n stuff is sort of limited in ways, for the stuff not there i just searched it up though, eventually figured out how to get going.  I brought some livestock in the game, but unfortunatelly i couldnt find where they had spawned :(. Except for a pig which i found but God help the sheep wherever they are. Im sure ill find them eventually.  I havnt been playing this game for years or hundreds of hours. But in my amount of game play, i think its a good agricultural simulator, especially when you get it on sale like it did.",1
"MUCH better than Diablo series. absolutly free to win with paid services available for cosmetics. Graphics are excellent, Game play is smooth and doesn't get old. Highly recommended to those of us who were disappointed with Diablo III.",1
addictive as beer,1
"A real diamond in the rough, the only flaw is that the story is quite short",1
street fighter is hype as ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥ign loser nerds,1
Perhaps the best co-op horror survival game out there. Most definately worth every cent you spend on it.,1
"For a constantly running background game, I'm sure this wouldn't be such a bad game to keep your focus on. I just couldn't stand it for long. The jump of prices were just too huge and there's no way I was going to spend money on this to get more heroes. I'd suggest more heroes being made, but only if suggestions are considered. Then again, it's not common I play these kind of games, so I'm not too surprised. It's just not for me.",-1
I have tried to get along with the game. I cant bring myself to complete this game. It just wont work.,-1
This is the only thing that can make me happy after I've watched a MattyB video.,1
"Although the game has an impressive feature where you can destroy a lot of stuff in-game. The overall campaign story is typical and dull. The main character comes out of nowhere as a hired gunman who is 'always known to get the job done.'  The controls tend to be very irritating at times, especially with the grapple hook. And the character runs seemingly slow.  Gameplay is repetitive, shoot these guys, destroy this, follow this, go here go there.  The game had so much potential, it still has work that needs to be done.  As it shouldn't be a problem to learn from your mistakes, the game developers should look back at the flaws of their previous game titles and try to fix them in future game titles.  I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to offer in Just Cause 3!  But for now, the final verdict of this game is ***6/10***",1
"Hey morapulers, I suppose you want me to review this pulende game. Well, I'll pulende review it for you. It's about some pulende bikkje that can pulende enter other morapulers' dreams and help them or pula them up. Skit like that. Overall, the game is just a pulende skitbyrde of heavy-handed moralizing like its pulende predecessors. Avoid, especially if you don't want to listen to 'Hollywood English'.",-1
Fast paced and action packed! Colorful graphics and weapons make this game extremely enjoyable!,1
This is a good game if you are into things that can game. 15/11 would play again.,1
"Edit: I break down the Ork playstyle as OP in this review. To prove my point, I played regicide Orks against Grand Master difficulty Space Marines. I won on the first try with minimum casualities. I took a screenshot and uploaded it as proof.   hate to give this a negative review.  The visuals are wonderful. The VAs are (as with all 40k games) excellent.   However,  Right off the bat, I don't think the choice of armies was the best. In terms of fluff, you have a chapter of 1000 super soldiers facing off against a force so large it's called 'The Green Tide'. You'll lose over a dozen of these prized soldiers in a single battle. I'm sure GW wanted their Space Marines instead of IG, but it really just doesn't make sense.   Second, I find that (in my opinion) the Regicide Orks are overpowered compared to the Space Marines. SM have a lot of skills focusing on defense and maintaining the line, while Orks are very agressive.  For example: Space Marines have abilities that...allow units in a 3x3 to shoot more accuratley, another that regains armor, and one that grants extra toughness when an enemy is nearby.  Orks, on the other hand have abilities that allow them to regain health on attack, shoot twice in a single round, and they have several units that increase critical hit chances.   My problem is that (assuming every hit is successful) it takes 4 snapshots from SM pawns to take down a single Ork pawn. Orks can take down an SM king (non-assault) in 2 turns (or less) through a mixture of snapshot and more dakka (Emperor help you if they get a critical). Orks are aggressive to the point where all you can really do as SM is create a wall of bodies to hide behind. In assault, Ork pawns deal 4 damage to Space Marines. SM pawns only have 8hp. Without bonuses, SM pawns deal 3 damage to Orks. Ork pawns have 12hp.  Space Marines do have more armor and can hunker down better than orks, but it doesn't really matter in the campaign mode. Why doesn't armor matter?  Here's an example:  An SM bishop with +1 damage does 5 damage to a normal armored Ork.  If an Ork has no armor, you now do 6 damage.  However, that bishop can only shoot once a turn and no unit does more damage than a bishop. Regardless of whether or not an Ork has armor, under the best possible circumstances, it takes a minimum of 3 hits to kill an Ork Pawn and only 2 hits to kill a Space Marine Pawn.   Additionally, Orks are oriented toward assault (melee) combat while SM have more shooty bonuses. Problem is that on an 8x8 game board, (and especially when the majority of your units can only move forward) units will more often than not end up adjacent to eachother, which is ideal for Orks. I could see this working as 3 dimensional chess (perhaps with 40k style buildings instead of just barriers), but as it stands it feels like the Space Marines are simply outgunned at every opportunity and forced to agressively use defense bonuses in the campaign.   Here's a prime example because this will happen to everyone either in campaign or skirmish:  You have 2 SM pawns. There is 1 Ork pawn adjacent in front of you. You have 3 initiative. Assuming you hit twice, that 12hp Ork is now down to 6hp.  Now lets flip the script.  You have 2 Ork pawns. There is 1 SM pawn adjacent in front of you. You have 3 initiave.  Assuming you hit twice with assault, that SM is now dead.   Third, the campaign can be pretty annoying. Not because of anything to do with the gameplay, but because if you ever need to restart the scenario, you can't just get back in the action. You need to watch the dialouge scroll and the primary, secondary, fail objectives again. Why yes, there is a skip button. It doesn't actually skip the dialouge and objectives though. It just makes them all load faster. You still have to sit through all of the dialouge and objectives every single time you restart a mission, despite that the objectives are conviently located on the left side of your screen. In any other game, this would be the equivelent of having an unskippable cutscene for every single combat encounter.   Finally, there's cosmetics. You may notice in the promotional video on Regicide's Steam page that one of the cosmetics is an Ultramarines Captain (with a big Roman crest). Yeah. That isn't in the game. You just get a reskinned SM King. About the most advanced cosmetic in the game is either that Dark Angels terminators are bone colored or that Blood Axes have camoflauge. So why have promotional videos with content that is not in the game?   So although I enjoy the game and will continue playing it, I really can't recommend it to others.",-1

This Game To me was very fun until recently when i lost my password to the login.. If they had actual emails to verify it that would have been one thing but instead it sends u a thing saying you need to retype your email and password..if you are changing the password because you forgot it how are you suppose to be able to get a new one. Next EA does the same games every year idk why they cant just change up the content a little like make a career manager mode you hear me. ButLastly the upward to this game is that the graphics are great and the game runs smooth. Just dont forget your password!,1
When will fnaf world come out? and i really like fnaf.,1
"Amazing game. Very nice story, a bit annoying at times, but still good none the less. Graphics are very nice for their time. Some may find the cartoonish fantasy style to be a bit difficult to deal with. And there is a lot to this game. I have to say though, Skyrim beats oblivion in immersion. In Oblivion, I found it harder to feel a part of the world than I did in Skyrim or Morrowind. I think this has to do with the graphics, how everyone speaks to you, and how the world kind of revolves around you. I haven't played Oblivion with mods, however, I believe the modding community, in the past, has released a lot of good content. Now days, I believe the modding community is rather dead.  Still not as good as Morrowind.",1

"This game is like Warhammer 40K Space Marine's brutalness mixed with the nice melee mechanics of Chivalry. Plus, the levels are many and long with plenty of secrets to find. The humor adds a nice break between each fight, and during. Overall, It's one of the best single player games I've ever played",1
"Move Or Die is easily one of the most enjoyable and fun multiplayer games that there is. It’s designed in a way where it’s easy to learn and anybody can pick it up and play it. It has a great number of different minigames and optional mutators that keep the game enjoyable to play. It also has different announcers that you can choose from. And the comedy of the game is nice too. If you like to play multiplayer games that are enjoyable, fun, tense, and funny, then I highly recommend Move Or Die!",1
Game is fun and it is free!!! Reminds me very much of D&amp;D's Shadow over Mystara or Streets of rage ,1
The Developers MUST work a lot on the engine to run the game 4GB of ram to run is too much! DayZ just need 2GB to run and it is WAY BETTER THAN THIS PIECE OF CRAP! My money was burn into ashes!,-1
"The first few levels were fine,yet when I get to the more harder levels I lose it. This game is too intense for me.  Do reviews need rates? If so 10/10",1
Best 'P' key simulator ever invented.  ....I mean great story. 9/10 for me. (;,1
"Very fun, awesome, and cool. Though if you want a Worms game closer to Worms Armageddon you should wait for the new Worms and buy that one since it looks a bit more like that game, but if you want a new Worms experience buy this one instead (or Worms Clan Wars).",1
"Great game, changed a lot since the beta. Never played as the monster during the beta, I'll be on that now I think. So far so good.",1
Surprisingly enjoyable little fantasy jaunt! Don't let the low-ish meta-critic scores put you off - its rather good!! A definite pick up in the sales :D  Awesome fun and a worthy challenger to the Elder Scrolls games. I would honestly say I had more fun playing this than Morrowind &amp; Oblivion - plus I actually put the time and effort in to complete Two Worlds unlike the Bethesda offerings. Really good fun overall!,1
"Firstly to those who never played before any of the Payday games, it is a FPS game which you play as one of the four different criminals and go through different missions such as cooking meths, robbing banks and even framing people. The character that you pick does not have any additional skills or traits.   -Pros For the pros of the game I would say that it is actually a very challenging and versatile game as you play through the different missions that have different motives and in some or most of the missions, whether you complete all the motives or failed any one of it could change what you were actually after, like in reality when criminals made mistakes and had to change their plans, I find that point is actually quite interesting when you haven tried out the missions. You're also able to choose to go loud, which means that you just rush in and start killing people to complete your motive or you could choose to go stealth and what equipment you choose to use in the mission could affect you if you choose to go stealth. You are also able to continue leveling even after you reached the maxed level 100, as you proceed to increase your Infamy level which gives you extra bonuses like infamous mask which is a sunglass and extra XP when you complete your mission. But for the best part is, YOU CAN SLAP POLICES TO DEATH WITH A BUNDLE OF MONEY. :D  -Cons There are quite a few cons which setback the game, like some of the guns are from the DLC and the price of the DLC even during sales would be either almost or more then the price of the game on a 66% sale, and examples are Snipers, we dont have any free snipers to use and they are only unlock through the DLC, I personally dont recommend getting the DLC as the price is just over. The difficulty ''Death Wish'' seems to almost be made to not be able to complete in some missions, as they keep spamming a bunch of enforcers, tasers, bulldozers and cloakers and even the enforcers are tough to kill, not to mention the even tougher guys.  Overall, the game itself is wonderful, I had a great time playing the different missions and trying out different ways to complete it, the community was also nice, had lots of fun with the random people that comes in to join the mission, the only thing that is bad about this game is the DLCs, it contains a lot of the games accessibility that players who didn't want to buy the DLCs couldn't have, and to those who bought it, it could actually get you another decent game on sales rather then just a few missions, guns, mods and achievements. Therefore, my rating for the game is 8/10, and if you really wan the DLC, do wait for sales, if not its a really total waste of money getting it.",1
"Full disclosure: I backed the Kickstarter and I've played during the beta.  Wasteland 2 may look a bit iffy on the graphics end and there are some bugs that haven't been fixed yet (although I haven't seen anything gamebreaking yet) but quality can be found in just about everything else.  This game is basically made for anyone who was a big fan of the old Fallout games (1 and 2) and possibly the first Wasteland game that came out in 1988. You take the role of four desert rangers who have been tasked with traveling to different areas in Arizona to help people in need in a world where nuclear war has taken place and is now... well, a Wasteland. The world is ridden with radioactivity, punks, fanatics, cyborgs, the list goes on.  Wasteland 2 is a roleplaying turn-based strategy game. You have the ability to move about as either a group or split your team members up for tactical advantages. For example, mabye one of your team members is a sniper and you want that person to stay behind and pick off the enemies while your mid to close range characters take the front line. Be careful though since this game has friendly fire.  As you start you get to create your four characters in a typical roleplaying game fashion. Place stats, choose skills, names, looks, etc. It can be very tricky to pick the right skills for each character because there are many skills to choose from and you won't be able to pick them all and still be able to use them all effectively since there won't be enough points for you to distribute for such a run. You will quickly notice that there are occasional obstacles that will require a quite high level in whatever skill is needed.  One of my favourite aspects of Wasteland 2 is the text that is constantly being displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Just like in the Fallout games, it details your surroundings, people you meet, objects, etc, just as if it was being told by a very witty game master in a pen-and-paper roleplaying game. Wasteland 2 has lots of black comedy, and I'm a sucker for comedy in games. I generally don't read most flavour text in video games, but in Wasteland 2 I'm willing to make an exception.  All in all, I'm glad to see that Wasteland 2 turned out the way it did because it proves that Kickstarter can work as long as you crowdfund the right projects. Anyone who played the older Fallout games or Wasteland 1 will most likely be very happy to play this. I would go as far as to call this the real Fallout 3.  GOTY 2014.",1
This game is much deeper than what it seems to be and rewards the player with more information then those who just skip a level thye dont understand. Personally i really love this game and i hope to see more from this game Nice Job,1
mountain blade a best game,1
"I LOVE River City Ransom.  I would like to love this game too but the controls (and lack of) are trash.   There is no pause button, and you are limited to the J,U, and O keys on the keyboard.  Even with Full controller support, I had to use Joy2Key just so I could use a controller and still with the lack of the pause button and not having more specific keystroke functions, this game just seems unplayable to me.   Other than that, I would say this is a great game but I cannot recommend it due to poor controls.",-1
"I loved this game on the xbox, and now that I have it on Steam, it's so much better.  As there's no cost to play online on steam, this game reaches its maxinum potention with one purchase.  I recommend getting multiple copies, as this game is very boring alone.",1
I have to say that Blues and Bullets Episode 1 grabbed my attention and kept it. I did not even notice the time pass as I had to keep playing until I completed the entire episode. It has a good story and interesting art work which includes motion capture. You are immersed in this Noir world and I am looking forward to the next episode. I only hope they keep the same quality.,1

"The best LotR game out there. Like Arkham if Batman took the gloves off. Like Assassin's Creed if you actually assassinated people. Like Red Faction: Guerilla if you only had a sword and bow to take down the evil empire. The Nemesis system works beautifully, and the story is reasonably entertaining.",1
I've played it for a while and I seem to be unable to see anything interesting about this game.,-1
I really enjoy this game. It's a good and hard game that really feels like an old platformer. I would highly recomend this game to my friends and or family!,1
"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  'R.A.W' is nothing but cheap ripoff of diablo and torchlight together, honestly i can't even say that because of several reasons, both games have at least half linear gameplay, what i mean, you have options to do either side quests and obtain better gear or just stick to main quest or farm for experience and gold, but in 'R.A.W' it's totally irrelevant, forget about side quests, there is only one option you have to stick to main quest there is no way back, not to meantion path is so small and tight that sometimes there can run into invisible walls which are blocking from moving. Incredibly idiotic AI, they can get stuck at walls or invisible walls trying to get to shortest paths there is... Game likes to play jokes on players, because you know why not. Best part is, it would make lot of sense if there was health bar on each enemy, if you are damaging it or not, when you came across but instead they rush at you, surround you, that basically means you are dead, just as soon player gets damage it cancels all your attacks / animantions, because you know why not. Sometimes it's impossible to notice when player gets attacked by spiders and what's with the spiders, every new level has spiders in it. Could not they come up with something else besides spiders? Is this some kinda dungeon crawler spider killing simulator? I love some parts of game when there is 'HUGE Boss type event' and game just simply spawns huge mobs of enemies either behind you or in front of you, killing them does not help in any way because you have to move 'somewhere' and how people can know this when there is no in game map? That adds even more frustration. Whats with Local coop? Is this game from year 2000?   Dreadful story, plain dumb tips, unresponsive controls, no rebindable keys, redundant UI and skill trees, no in-game map, yeah you know why does player needs map when 'R.A.W' is so freaking linear tight game.",-1
If you don't recomend this Id software title I will punch you in your mouth,1
"Pretty underwhelming, it basically takes the badguys from half life 2, the soldier types and the badguy scenery from halo and the environment from fallout and borderlands. Pretty much nothing about this game is original, it is a below average shooter, thats sort of fun to play but not even close to being worth 21$ I got it at cnd tire for 5$ and that is the maximum i would have payed for it. The story is loose and you feel no inclination to follow it and the hardest difficulty is an absolute joke, with your pretty much instantaneous regeneration, double bring-you-back-to-life-and-kill-everyone-around you device that is implanted in you plus insta healing bandages that can be purchased for pretty much nothing 5/10 would not recommend",-1
"Not as good (IMO) as Walking Dead, but recommend for fans of TWD.  TWAU is a modern-fantasy mystery game. The entire premise is that you're a private detective of sorts, investigating a series of gruesome killings.  The twist is that you're THE 'Big Bad Wolf', and the victims are all other supernatural creatures, who are all hiding in 1980's New York City.  The premise is definitely interesting, and does allow for some fantastic storytelling and characters, but if you're expecting something as emotional and impactful as TWD, you'll be a little dissapointed, at least so far (only 2 episodes out so far as I write this).",1
"This game is utter garbage. I played the neverhood as a child and it was an amazing game and I am utterly disapointed by this huge let down. First of all, the gameplay is the most repetativ ♥♥♥♥ ever. You litterally do the same thing ovver 3 times and each time you think your game is broken because the cutscenes are in Freench. It is not only until the end where you will get a lever that will change it to english. However, if you miss this lever, like I had, the game will softlock itself. I spent more time fixing that bug than playing the game.  With this negative review I am not saying the puzzle genre is dead or even a claymation stop motion type game isn't going to be able to be sucessful. In the end the gameplay is left to one small puzzle repeated 3 times that happens to be extremely bugged. ",-1

"This game looked like a lot of fun, however the the interface is too glitchy words on menu options to show up, none of the onscreen displays work correctly and when navigating the mansion it flashed horribly and I was feeling like I was about to get sick. despite this I decided to still give it a try, managed to play/crack the first safe but since the gui was broke so bad I was unable to read the keycode to get to the next area.   Just incase anyone is thinking I could be attempting to play this on a commadore 64 or something, no it's not my system for example I have over 1000 (yes 3 zeroes) time the recomended RAM.",-1

"It's more or less the same game it was before, only now it's F2P. Everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) can be unlocked via grinding the in-game currency. Perks can be stacked to increase their bonuses accordingly, leaving some worthless and others essentially must-use-all-the-time.   Most  All game modes except for hunt have been disabled outside of custom matches, every class can now use the arena dome on a team-wide cooldown and it's also automatically placed so no more worries about your trapper missing it and screwing the team.  Also, popular streamers are randomly being given enough coins to unlock everything in the game (Or so I assume - they're being given 100k which sounds like more than a little bit). Not entirely sure how to think about that considering the matchmaking seems to be solely based on your account XP level, and much like founder accounts, having everything from the start against new players can be more than slightly broken, particularly if you've played the game before it went F2P. I should also note founders don't have every perk unlocked and maxed at the start while streamers can and no doubt do once they're given their coins. Don't expect to just throw up a twitch channel and get free coins though, they only seem to do it for 'popular' streamers.   Matchmaker is consistently breaking for me as well. Either leaving me at a screen with 4 slots showing 'player found', or COMPLETELY breaking after a match and not even giving me menu options to leave/quit aside from alt+f4.   Fixed in a patch.  Couple potential issues:   -You can literally go AFK as the monster and have the AI take over for you. I understand the reasoning behind this but it can often wreck unskilled teams, and sometimes even good ones.  'Take a break' removed due to abusing it for free grinding.  -There is no penalty whatsoever for leaving a match early. Losing horribly to a premade group of hunters? Alt+F4! Good monster got you on the ropes? Quit and it's like it never happened! They've also disabled joining games in progress, so if a non-host leaves it's presumably taken over by the AI, and if the host leaves, well, that match never happened.",1
"The basic setup for Rogue Legacy is quite simple: Explore the castle, earn money and equipment, defeat bosses. The twist comes in with how deaths and progression is treated in this roguelike-like. Each death moves the spotlight from the hero parent to the son or daughter. You are given a choice of which child, each with their own quirks, to continue your legacy and brave the castle. The skills, equipment, and runes earned persist across deaths while the money resets to nothing in order to enter the castle. Each generation is constantly trying to earn money to help their future generations have an easier time.",1

"It's no fluke Rise of the Triad's 2013 remake has invited attention and excitement from a niche of arena and twitch FPS fans. A title fondly recalled in memories of the few being remade in UE3 is enough to make even the most cynical player dream of a return of the fast-paced, chaotic times of FPS yore.  Made after the now toxic Duke Nukem Forever licence was taken away, ROTT is obviously made by a team with fond memories of the original. In fact, it's probably a little too fond. As you progress further and further through the game, you realise core gameplay has changed very little in the almost twenty years since the first game was released. Sure, rocket jumping is a breeze, now, and it even has mouselook like all the kids are talking about. But with a tedious array of enemies that almost exclusively barrel at you with hitscan rifles that even the swiftest player is bound to be scraped by, it's less of a ballet of surreal ultraviolence and turns too closely into a frantic porridge hunt or, worse, a slow, careful shooter that rewards careful, slow approach to situations than maneuverability and split second twitch aiming.  Nothing has been learned in all this time from the evolution of the genre, whichever way you look it - It does not have the interesting array of weaponry or diverse cast of monsters that Doom has to constantly challenge you, nor does it have leaning or cover that a more modern, 'tactical' shooter would encourage. It sits in the middle of both of these design philosophies as it once was all that time ago. But it can't rest on its laurels after all this time when the original simply wasn't considered particularly good. Its infamy came from its explicit violence, gore, and sense of humour, the latter of which has been replaced with painfully unfunny toilet humour and even more referential and internet meme humour (Writers everywhere, please, if you're reading this, can we have some good, original comedy, please?).  And even if you are a die-hard fan of the original, believing it is gameplay perfection, you'll find it difficult to still justify the purchase of this when the game is technically flawed in too many ways to count. Performance issues, bugs, map clipping errors, and technical shortcomings (You cannot rebind the weapon keys, half of your keyboard is likely not to work with binds, and you cannot turn off the mouse acceleration in the game, you need to edit a .ini file for this - In 2013, this is inexcusable!). With an apparently two programmers on a team of fifty artists, it's obvious where the emphasis on design was here, and if your technical foundation is not adequate, the content in it is wasted. If you must bring back a game from the past as close to the original as possible, you simply need more than pretty graphics and a 3D environment to justify its existence when even basic features and options do not exist or are broken.  I want to love this game. It's built with passion and a clear hatred of how FPS games have forgotten their roots. But to be so aloof about your own darling harms its credibility and place on the stage - There is nothing wrong with an obnoxious plotline and setting that still takes itself seriously, without hiding behind humour and ironic, meta-humour. And perhaps the developers need to be honest with themselves: Why make a throwback title that refuses to change anything about the core gameplay, when the original was sub-par? Maybe ROTT94 should have been left in the past as a stepping stone to where we are now, and a more respectable example of how arena FPS can hold strong in modern times. Maybe we could, dare I say... come up with something original, instead of tying ourselves to dated ideas that fog the timeless ones?",-1
"One of my all time favorite games. Lots of small changes and improvement over the engine presented in Fallout 3. Fun exploration, interesting factions, and the DLC adds great additions to the main story. Also tons of awesome mods make it worthy of many playthroughs.  9/10",1
"What can I say, this game used to be hard, then they added dlc to make it easier. When it was too easy, they needed to add new difficulty to keep the game entertaining. Still it was pretty hard, when two players had 50. caliber snipers it was doable, but the sniper took the primary weapon slot, so the players with snipers had to use secondary weapons against normal enemies.  Then they added 'overkill pack' dlc with rpg, the ultimate secondary weapon: one could now blast 2 bulldozers on hardest difficulty with one rocket, boring? Then they had to add captain winters, so if you don't take rpg, you can't end assault, but if you take rpg, it is super easy, and all the neat secondary weapons stay unused. Why not just make bulldozers with trophy systems on hardest difficulty, that would repell all the explosive attacks, would have been really fun and hard?  Then they made micro-transactions with stats boost and rebalanced all weapons, what were the previous dlc for then? They really wan't people to stop playing? I will not touch the game until they fix at least pay to win part, I and would advice you to stay away too.",-1
Love this game so much!!,1
I liked the game but its a shame that i called my self something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,1
"Got this game as a gift from my girlfriend who is now my wife. I haven't play this game for such a long time but I am going to finally finish it. I found that there are more games to boot. Hell yeah!  The Game is fun. It's missing some elements of a typical shooter but make up for it in visuals and a decent story. After playing all the Mass effects I was looking for a halfgood sub, I do not feel let down.  I give this game a 4 of 5. If my wife reads this I meant 5 of 5. lol",1
this game is awesome ,1
"I had this game for almost 3-4 years and I still find it enjoyable. The Cunning Stunts DLC really made things interesting and very fun to race your friends. The one thing I find dissapointing is how little attention they give the multiplayer missions like survival and Last Team Standing and everyone wants a taste of the new gamemodes but there is so many game modes now its hard to keep track.  I am also a big fan of the story mode so seeing the fact that the story is so short and easy to get through really defeats the purpose of the GTA franchise, please consider making a storymode DLC.  Over all its a really great game and the amount of new stuff they are giving to us GTA fans is astonishing.",1

"I didn't buy into the negative reviews of this, since it looked more appealing to me after my frustrations with MapleStory. Sadly, many of the reviews about La Tale are true.  I'll just summarize the entire time I played this game right now: 1. Get quest. 2. Kill monster(s) nearby for the quest, get the items needed. 3. Return to person who gave you quest. Get items and exp. Level up, distribute stat points. 4. Move onto next person to give you quest (or many times the same person who gave you the last quest). 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3. 6. Repeat everything above.  Quite literally every single second I played was the above steps. No variation, no exploring. Walk from one end of a map to the other, killing everything, waiting for things to respawn, and kill them again. It's fun for a couple hours, then you realize it's the same thing endlessly, and then you stop playing. Disappointing. I liked the design of many characters, of the enemies, the areas, etc. But they won't save this endless, monotonous grind-fest.",-1
One of the best RTS games I have played.,1
"This game is absolutely amazing. The controls are tight, the music and ambient sound never let up, and the visuals really capture the feel of a world from a small child's perspective. And the story, without giving anything away, will disturb you and might even make you think.  The controls feel very similar to Amnesia, at least in the sense of how you interact with the world. Opening doors and turning valves, picking up objects to throw, rotate, or carry, and using the bear as a flashlight will all feel very familiar to players that have braved the halls of Castle Brennenburg.  The audio, in all its forms, is unrelenting. Even the lack of audio at times will fill you with such a sense of impending dread that you will slowly and cautiously navigate the surrounding. And sometimes even the slightest 'bang' or 'crash' will send you scurrying towards any safe haven, for fear of something coming up behind you.  The visuals have such a grasp of a child's imagination it is uncanny. Words are as scribbles, sense a child cannot comprehend them, and drawings litter the worlds, as if a tiny person is giving you clues that you can easily understand without a spoken or written language. And the literal perspective of everything towering over you really draw on the feeling of helplessness in an unknown place, with only your teddy bear as comfort.  Overall, this is a delightful horror gem. There is no reason to only catch it on a sale, for fear of it being underwhelming. If you enjoy horror games with thought, puzzles, and huge atmosphere, then 'Among the Sleep' is an absolute must have.",1

"Just recently bought this game on Steam after owning it for a few years on Xbox. The PC version is far superior (go figure) and it doesn't suffer from any bugs as you may hear as Steam recently updated it to be compatible with up to Windows 8 (and possibly 10). Only buy this game however if you are willing to invest dozens or even hundreds of hours into a game. It's a juicy one boys and girls. Tons of content, multiple paths, many weapon and gear combinations, charming characters, great music, and beautiful environments. A must have for all gamers.   P.S. One of the few Star Wars games where a Light Side playthrough is just as rewarding as a Dark Side. XD",1

"Upon release, virtually every aspect of 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul recieved unprecedented praise. Flexibility of approach, depth of gameplay, a uniquely fascinating world and the rare gall to bring literary inspiration to a medium oft dismissed as 'low art'. Everything that was said was, and remains, true; you'll find few aspects of 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul that fall short of its monolithic critical reception. And yet, as if I need heap further praises upon this exquisite, immortal behemoth; the game is greater than the sum of its parts. 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul finds countless methods of meaningfully intertwining gameplay, presentation and narrative. Its true, emergent magic blooms herein; where all three facets strengthen one another. Every mechanic, no matter how innocuous, refers to, is given frightening new relevance in the light of, the game's themata. Tragic character has been breathed into each and every one of its objects, its powers,",1

"I returned this game for a refund. I still recommend it, but with some reservations.  'The Witness 'is beautiful and the puzzles are frustrating yet addicative and engaging. It's wonderfully crafted and the devs clearly put a lot of heart and sweat into it. I love that.   For people who enjoy puzzle games, strongly consider this one. For myself, I can't say I value it at $40, but that's based on my own gaming tastes; I'm not big into puzzle games.",1

"this was one of the first games i ever played, and with the new steam deal for the complete pack reunited me with my first ever game, ive only played a small tad for now, but the campaign is a really good story, get the gta complete pack, £10, worth the cash guys",1
Good Game.I blew a persons wing right off.I nosed dived into a ship.and i got killed by my own teammate who rammed me.11/10 Would get rammed again.,1
"you need to register and give your adress, full name , etc.",-1
There is a bug that is stopping lots of people from being able to start this INCLUDING ME. I haven't EVEN BEEN ABLE TO PLAY IT YET!!!! so i need a fix or the game needs an update or something but untile it does THANK ALOT FOR WASTING MY TIME!!!!!!!!,-1
So boring. 98% of the planets are dull and AI is awful.,-1
10/10 it's ok -  ign.com ,1
this game sucks my ♥♥♥,-1
LOVE IT! :D,1
"This game felt like it had potential, up until the point where it utterly sucked. Which was the first 2 minutes of the game. You crash land on an island filled with masked gods (Which have the longest, most annoying, and out of context conversations) and small man babies that you can kick around the island for some kind of point system. The objective of the game is to rechieve enough pieces from your blimp to rebuild it and fly off the god for sacken island. From what the trailer and images showed is that it is a sandbox adventure game in which you can create various aircrafts and boats to do various tasks with. But from the gameplay it shows that you have to pay in game currency for parts of the ships and it took me the two hours of playing this game to figure out how to activate the building sequence. Horrific voice acting, terrible and slow gameplay, and aweful game mechanics. Not even worth the two dollars I paid for this piece of crap on a Steam sale. -100000000/10",-1

"The best puzzle game money can buy, If your on the edge about getting it, then just buy it you won't regret it. if you havent played the first game however you should, seeing as how this is the sequel.   11/10 best game",1
"Dirty bomb has great gunplay and general mechanics. The downsides being the RNG Loadout system, poor matchmaking (it's beta) and obvious lack of content. Running the same exact maps over and over again gets old really fast and while the gameplay is very fun indeed, it's extremely repetitive.  The game has a decent skill ceiling, but after getting to the point where I consistently top the scoreboard, I have to say the game doesn't have much to offer in terms of variety. How each round plays out is mostly based on what map you play rather than what kind of mercs both teams are running. Most of the time the rounds boil down to the attackers rushing the objectives as fast as they can with little to no strategy, for it isn't really that important.  Map design is also poorly balanced and since the defender has to defend only one spot at a time, every push is pretty much the same. You spam explosives on the point to soften the defenses, then you rush the point and finish of the weakened defense. If it doesn't work out, you do it again.  Bottom line:  Gameplay is fun and addictive Maps are poorly balanced and designed Very little content and lack of strategy make the game repetitive  If you like arena shooters and games you can play every now and then, Dirty Bomb is for you. If you're looking for an FPS to take seriously and/or play for a long time, play something else.",-1
  Thank you for making this game free to play for the weekend. Literally one of the worst Call of Duties I have ever played. Well done.,-1
game is %100 dead :),1
"€20 game? Probably not unless it gets a serious update after this review. If you can get it for half that though it should be good value for it. As it stands this game is definitely worth a recommendation. Great multiplayer, mod support and the game looks like it is going to get even better in the future with added improvements.",1
GOOD STUFF LIKE IT ,1
it's making me re-live all my past realatonships where i just got rejected,1
I own this on the 360 but only played about halfway through and I saw this on the recent steam sale and decided to pick it up and play through it completely since my 360 is collecting dust now.   Unfortunately I was disappointed to find out that Snowblind did not improve the game visually for PC. I wasn't expecting Skyrim level graphics but just to assure myself I wasn't crazy I plugged in the 360 for a comparison and sure enough the graphics were identical. Even the menus are in 16:9 so if you are on a 16:10 monitor you'll have to deal with letterbox menus. Visually it is better than the PS3 version but if you own a 360 just head over to gamestop and grab a used copy so you can not worry about dealing with constant crashing.,1
Yo! Guys MW2 is best! &lt;3,1
"Note that this review isn't aimed at my impressions of the gameplay, story, soundtrack, but rather on optimisation of the game.  Ok, so I wasn't planning on getting this game at all, but since i ordered a new GPU, it came bundled free with the card. I wasn't really excited about the game, but since I already had it I decided to try it out. First thing that I noticed was that people were saying it's a really bad port, badly optimised and what not. Nevertheless, I fired the game up, played it for a bit and quite frankly I was really satisfied with the game.  I don't know how many FPS can I get, since the game is capped at 30fps, but I think it's not that bad. With my rig that consists of: Gainward GTX960 4GB, Intel i5 4460@3.2GHz, 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 and the game set on highest settings except nvidia gameworks (i turned those off) i am getting constant 30fps without a single dip in framerate, even in intense scenarios.  So far this game got me hooked on it's story and athmosphere and when I'm done with this one I'm planning on playing other arkham games if they're as good as this one.   Have a nice day and happy gaming!",1
"I love this game! Great effects and mechanics, the characters are all very unique and have different play styles, gotta try!",1
"Beautiful metroidvania, challeging puzzles and bosses, great atmosphere and artstyle, really enjoyed it.",1
"This game is fantastic. The plot is really good, the music is great, and the gameplay is simple yet enjoyable.",1
"Beyond Earth will polarise people, particularly those who are hardcore fans of Civ 5. I still enjoyed playing, would recommend the game and am curious as to what will come in the expansions.   A lot of game mechanics can be taken from Civ V, so that can be the starting points for comparision.  What I liked: The military system is simplified. There are base units which are upgraded throughout the game, rather than a variety of new units. They need to upgrade units are handled automatically which is nice relief.  The Orbital layers is a great little addition to the game.  The affinities provide a good change, and it fits into the game mechanics really well.  The virtues (culture generated buffs), are generall comparable to what you would expect in Civ 5.  Graphics are similar in technical quality to Civ V however the design of the maps are well done and engaging.   What I Didn't: You like the tech web or not. The level of choice is great, which you can either consider great for customisation or a little daunting. However, as with the wonders, all of the techs and wonders are rather 'soulless', they aren't particularly interesting and make the game a little immersive. They aren't really 'relatable', and the bonuses are simply just +something to stats, which are less creative than the Civ V wonders.   City states are gone. This was one of the greatest mechanics of CIV 5, and replaced by 'stations' which are far less engaging.  I personally am a fan of Civ 5's UI (I'm a sucker for good art deco), and just don't prefer the starkness of Civ BE.  There no religion or Great person mechanics, but I will guess these might come along inevitable expansions.",1
"An excellent edition onto a great set of games. After modding and patches have been added many of the minor inconviences will have been fixed. If you feel that you want to hold off until patches arrive like was needed for civ 5 then wait and pick it up then. That said, there is a lot of great gameplay already in the game and I'm glad i already got it.",1
PROS:  The graphics and sound are amazing on this game. the puzzles are challenging and object locations change with in the puzzles. The quests objectives are ok.   CONS: Constantly waiting for energy to recharge(unless you want to pay for gems). Would like to see more locations on the map.,1
You can be you own captain passive or aggressive. Great game!!,1
"Holy ♥♥♥♥, a game that actually calls you by you name. 10/10",1
"Think about it for a second. The HL1 Anthology come with 3 games? Half-Life 3 confirmed, ♥♥♥♥♥es! And wait, what's that? There's a Valve game file titled L4D3. LEFT 4 DEAD 3 CONFIIIIIIRMED!!!!!!!! Smosh games made a very intersting point, but if you multiply 6x2 instead you get 12. The digits in 12 are 1 and 2. 1+2=3. PORTAL 3 CONFIIIIIIIIRMED!!!!!!!!!! Also, take a look at Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Notice how there are 2 2s. Half-Life has 8 letters. Square 8 useing the 2 in Half-Life and you get 64. Episode has 7 letters. Square that with the other 2 and you get 49. 64-49=15! Wait..... Does it mean what I think it means? Yes, IT MEANS PORTAL 3 IS COMING OUT IN 2015!!!!!!",1
"Perhaps i was nostalgia blinded when buying this game, first level i got a trolly stuck on top of my head not to mention you couldnt play this game unless you had a controller play in on the game cube guys Good game, Bad port",-1
this game rocks i recommend this game it worth it :D its cool if you play it at night i hop their is season 2 of it soon? i think?,1
"CS:S is a fun multiplayer game, and with bots if you have no friends like myself. It also provided lots of textures to use in other source games... So yeah, you may need this.",1
"if you were expecting a game about jumping the border, you're out of luck",1
"this game is extremely slow...no shortcut, no more interesting skills, all u need is just grind grind grind....i explain why i got this feelings..  1. gold is almost useless, maybe just brought materials to craft items. i gamble 200 sometimes, not worth it... 2. it seems that all the items can be craft by the workshop(i don't know whether gamble can get special items, like some rage potion?), and the blacksmith need exp to level up to craft next level items. some meterials like vampire teeth don't know how to get it ... i need level-2 items, but i had to made over 5 useless level -1 items to level up the blacksmith 3. the character init items, 0 gold , cann't be sold, also u cann't discard it too~~~~ 4. all the items is fix value, lack of buff/debuff/skills 5. SPEED is so overpowered, the only way u recover in the dungeon is potions, but if u take the first action, instant kill enemies will save lots of potions, by the way, if u lack of damage cann't kill the monster... K.O  6. the dungeon map is FIXED, so the thief's skill is like a joke...if u played the map before, u can avoid all traps.... 7. talent point CANN'T RESET, according to rule 5, if u put the first 2 talent point not into the damge, it will be a hard time to wait your character level up 8. seems no way to revive a K.O charater in the dungeons. 9. no shortcut, when i press 1, u select the thief's normal attack, then u press enter hope to target the only monster, u cann't do it. there are no keys can select the second/third spell, also when it's bard's turn now, press 1 won't select the first spell, how sad.the shortcut is a bug. 10. also this game have some UGC system, unfortunately, it will cost the scrolls seems like u have to grind pvp arena to get more rooms.  X. ABOVE ALL this game is not like a rogue-like game or a ARPG, lack of content, no depth PGC system.  yes, it's much more like a casual MOBILE game...maybe not, because this game sometimes makes u feel really hard for some operation/ game mechanism reason. pls give me a reason why i should proceed this game?",-1
this dame game is awesome ^^,1
great game but after the new update my game just crashes i hope u guys fix this soon,1
"I got halfway through the game and I thought 'well I could stop playing right now and be happy with my purchase' I have honestly never enjoyed a game this much, there is a versatility of things to do and wide skill trees to branch out into, to tailor your runner into the zombie killing, wall running beast you can be. I was happy with the original map you start in and then around halfway through the game it introduced a whole new map around the same size and I was at a loss for words because the size of this map was breathtaking. Don't worry if you're thinking 'quality over quantity' because this game's world seems like every inch of it was made with detail, intending the best free-running and zombie slaughtering experiences in mind.   10/10",1
I now think with portals and so should you.,1
Its a nice game... I hope that dota will create some new hero....,1
Terrible.. i loved all the borderlands because they had that 1 thing that pre sequal does not we dont know what that is but its not their. pre sequal at the first mission was just a joke......  ..... your up againts afew enimies and there just op and f**** like really!? they should of made the first mission a bloody DLC with how far you must travel if you die you spawn allllllll the way back even if you like 100 yards from where you need to go nope you die you go all the way back to the start .... still on first mission i get to my objective of destroying 4 items i go to do that and i turn around and their is like 10 things attacking me i get demolished.... rate this game 3/10,-1
Nice game !!!,1
Love the fast paced tps action. a little grind heavy but you never realy realize youre grinding as youre carving through enemies like a hot knife through butter.,1
"Very unique game, and a good way to spend an hour. The price suits it very well, it is definitely worth a try.",1
"This game is great I love it. I didn't find it hard even on 'Quite Hard' mode, the highest difficulty in the game but it's still loads of fun! I think it was much better than the previous game BIT.TRIP RUNNER because checkpoints are added. I give 9/10.",1
Well... that was a trip and a half...,1
"Poor grafix, user interface lacks information, after 100 hours on game i still don't understand how relationships work.... And yet, i enjoy it everyday.... This is key!",1
"While this is fun to play I can't recommend it as there is basically no online community for it and no real servers running, which just leaves a single player practice mode where you shootout with bots. I'd recommend fistful of frags if you are looking for a decent Wild West shooter, and that game is free!",-1
"Brilliant game, loads of fun! Would definitely reccomend!",1
"Great game! Looking forward to their next work, This War of Mine",1
A fun and strategic game. Sure the game is kinda short but this game is just absolutely amazing.,1
its a awesome game,1
very highly recommend this game for you guys,1
"Sir, You Are Being Hunted may look like a good game in the pictures but it really isn't that good. The point of the game is quite boring, there's not really any objectives besides collecting stones. Luckily, I was able to refund this game.",-1

One of the best Dreamcast games of all time \^_^/,1
Very great Flight Sim.Combat Sims like these are getting more rare :/ The graphics are decent for 2007 but effects and destrution are beautiful!,1
"This game may be 10+ years old and may look a bit outdated, it is another great fps from Valve, the game has many modes such as zombie, hostage, diffusing C4 and Jail server, not as good as Counter Strike:G.O but still an excellent game to play in your spare time.",1
It's boring and nothing happens.,-1
Really had no idea what I was doing and the fighting is really bad.,-1
it needs to be longer,1
this game is like silent hill on super acid because its a platformer ♥♥♥♥♥!!!!!,1

great game love it if you dont got it for sure get it,1
The most ambitious project of this generation - don't let it die!!  ,1
Portal 2 is a fascinating game with many mind-boggling levels. It includes a great storyline and some humor which all in all made the game wonderful. I would give it a 10/10,1
I love this game!!,1

"This is the second DOOM game I have ever played, (considering that I'm younger than most) and I absolutely love it. The graphics are absolutely breathetaking. The gameplay and story is very rich and pulls you in and doesn't let go. Although the campaign might be a bit on the shorter side, I loved it. If you complete the campaign too early, try it on a higher difficulty. Each being harder than the last. If you get tired of the campaign, you can now do multiplayer. I have only played about an hour of multiplayer, but I can already tell you that the community is going to keep growing and growing. This game is already huge, and it deserves it. Great job on the developers part on making this game. If you ever have some extra money laying around, I definitely recommend picking up DOOM.",1
One of the best games I have played This year.,1
its a great game but with the amount of dlc there is it leaves you to wonder if they should have already put this all in the game or made another payday game alltogether,1
"Buy it on sale if you like hack'n'slash games.  For unknown reasons they've cut a lot of content when they've ported it to PC from Wii, but it still can be fun. Yeah, the story is meh. Buy it on sale and enjoy hacking.",1
Really bad compared to fs15 in my opinion ,-1
Never got my fences or anything for that matter,-1
"Okay, listen, you want to preform eye surgery with pencils? cool You want to swap around his liver and lungs in a heart transplant? Done YOU WANT TO DO BRAINSURGERY IN A MOVING AMBULANCE WITH A TOMOHAWK?! Meh, why not (though the eye surgery requires the AE DLC I believe)",1
good game.   why the ♥♥♥♥ leon's hair is so emo  ,1
I LOVED THE GAME 10/10 WOULD WATCH THEM TITIES MORE! ;),1
This game is so fun is out of this planet !!! oh wait lol,1
One of the best games I have ever played.,1
"Pure archery madness!!! fun bow controlles good exercise!  (lots of movment in this game, watch your cords!)",1
Sometimes the game is beautiful and sometimes it's awful (using zoom on pixelized drawings isn't a good idea). And puzzles and very boring in the second act (especially wiring the robots). Lots of point and click are better than this one.,-1
"The art and interface are superb! The gameplay is genius.  I've played several 4x space games since Master of Orion 2. Endless Space is the first commercial release that actually hits the mark. Although I do miss the Antarans and a bit of espionage, the development team has plenty of lattitude for further updates without worrying about breaking the balance.",1

"One of the best WWII RTS games out there to buy! But not for the weak-minded the learning curve is a bit of a challange, but all worth the effort.",1
♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ 10/10,1
"Suggested Retail Value: $3 (or less) First Play Value: 1/5 (frustrating, clunky, unresponsive controls make early play sessions tedious) Replay Value: 2/5 (will likely get less frustrating as you learn to compensate for the clunky controls, and since the storyline isn't that great, a replay will likely be just to see if you can beat earlier runs)  The comparisons to Mega Man X are warranted, but only if you accept that it's an unfair comparison: MMX is a much better game.  A.R.E.S. is very linear.  Item/character upgrades are incredibly grindy and (for some silly reason) all require WAY too much of all 3 types of currency. You character is very large in relation to your environment and enemies, which along with the controls makes the combat feel less about skill and agility and more about memorizing sections of levels and enemy movement patterns. Environments have slight variations between the different levels, but each level soon becomes internally repetitive, quickly making you wish something would change. The same 3 or 4 types of enemies are reproduced over and over again in each level, with few new variations being added in later levels.  The boss fights were uninspired, and (like the levels) success will be linked to memorizing movements and getting lucky (you're just too big and environments too small, controls too clunky to dodge by skill instead of memory).   I can't recommend this when there are better platformers out there, with tighter controls, more creative levels and enemies, much more interesting weapons and character upgrades, and far superior storylines... and they often cost less.",-1
"I love this game, it's only 11$ and even though they're making another game they still update it!",1
"ART, purely said, ART.. incredibly work from Telltale, as if season 1 wasnt enough of a masterpiece, this blows it out of the water.",1
this game is the best PLAY IT,1
"this game was better before you added game modes together in quick dive, I dont enjoy getting killed by magic headshots and having to wait 5 minutes for the people who aren't interested in the objectives to finally run out the timer, or run away from the fight until the timer ends the game.",-1
Broken beyond repair A great game done no justice by this iteration. At least half a dozen times I posted bug info and ideas to the forums and never once has anything been fixed. Don't waste your time destroying your heart on this.,-1
I just couldn't stand that they used voices from the movies. It completely ruined the whole game for me.,-1
its a great game,1
"Really one of the best Survival games ever! Insanely fun Co-op, and plenty hours of good fun. However, for beginners I would recommend the core game (DS) just to get basics.",1
"Awesome WW1 game, I suffer from fps hangs frequently, generally over 90 fps, but when enemies pop into rendering range get a big hangup, very frustrating. Otherwise awesome game with trench warfare.-",1
"This is one of the best games I have ever played, but for some reason some people don't like it.  I bought it for a few of my friends, they deleted me. Now I don't have to buy them real games for Christmas! 10/10 Best Friend Loser Simulator",1
   It's free and still not worth it!!,-1
This game is the greatest robbery simulator because it robs from the community. How great!,-1

"I have Athlon X4 860k, Radeon R7 265, 8GB ram. When only one or two cores are in use, its a cpu bottlenack for a game, whitch can nog use all cpu cores. One example fof all. Stalker, especially Clear Sky is havy to run graphics to max settings with one cpu core. The fps drpos are horrible by me. But with CpuCores run game in all four cores and so is game playable. No droped fps and higher average fps. Now I can play the game in full. Looks great and run smooth. I recomended this app for low machines like is mine.",1
"This was my favorite game to play... Much better than any Call of Duty, fast-paced and tactical. Compares to Battlefield Bad Company 2 (best modern FPS game of all time). The game had a steep learning curve, but could be played without learning everything. Guns could be acquired to match the pros. The community was fun. PVP was fun. Demolition games were intense. Co-op games were thrilling....   THEN AERIA CAME!   At first the game remained great. Aeria actually fixed some problems, but also messed up a lot more. Then they implimented their pay-to-win system as everyone else has already mentioned. You need at least $1,000 real life cash to get anywhere in this game now. I was lucky enough to own 6-8 accounts stacked with some good guns (but not all of the ones I wanted). Sadly, I will never use them again unless another company takes over. Aeria's customer service is also ♥♥♥♥. It took me a year to get my main account back after they LITERALLY ♥♥♥♥ING BANNED ME FOR NOT BUYING ANYTHING FOR A FEW MONTHS! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!?   Yea, so tl;dr, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It's a waste of time. Aeria does not listen to the community and does their own thing. The forum is useless and won't get you anywhere. The game died back in 2012 and has only managed to live this long due to no-life Asian gamers and possible BRs (only the rich ones though).",-1
If you like pinball games you will sure like this one. Great recreation of some of the most popular pinball machines ever built. It gives excellent support for the Logitech F710 controller.  Have fun!,1

"The best game in the Bioshock franchise. A little bit on the short side, but the incredible story, gunplay, new mechanics, and roster of characters definitely make up for it.

"The only other recording device I've ever used was an old EZCap for my tv. This however is definetly worth the price. It records in very good quality, hardly affected my computer's performance while it was active and one of my favorite parts, it actualy tells you the current status of your Duel/Quad Cores. The only complaint I have for it is that it activated my microphone and tried to record me. This however was easily fixed.",1
"Hitmang: Blood Money is the beautifully crafted story of an adolescent boy growing up trying to figure out what life is all about. In the game you encounter unique moments that are iconic to a young man's life - ranging from killing your first victim to hiding your first cold, lifeless body. Hitmane: Blood Monet is a great game, but it does have it's cons: -Controls are sort of funky  -Optimization for PC is just not there -Very violent for an E+ rated game (this  really  surprised me) -Levels feel very boxed in, and it often feels like there is nowhere to go, and going about most situations is very one-sided. Other than that, the game is sure to provide some quality entertainment. Now for some pros. +Physics engine is pretty good. It can be a bit too realitic sometimes, but that's ok +Graphics are fantastic, especially for when the game was released. They may not be up to par today, but the game is still just as enjoyable. +The story is very rich with drama, romance, comedy, and especially blood - which is just essential for any Hotman game. +Has an E+ rating, so many different types of age groups can enjoy it. Overall, Hit and Run: Brood Mother is a pretty great game! I give it a 9.5/10. Thanks for reading!",1
"This game really wasn't that bad. Could have developed the story more and really would have liked to see that. Also, at some points in the game the english is a little bit off. But, if being chased(hint*) sounds like something you'd love to do on the weekends then give this game a try. I provided a video link of the game below if you'd rather watch than dish out the pennies for this game.           YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;",1
by far one of the best games i have ever played. this game always keeps me up late at night. XD,1

it took the ♥♥♥♥ing game what the hell would you have me right here,1
"♥♥♥♥♥♥ off some high level player on online mode, he proceeded to hunt me in an armoured truck and put bounties on my head. Killed him several times and laughed while he raged.  11/10 would murder him again.",1
"I'm still very, very early on in the game, but as I'm now on my fourth character start, there are some things I'd like to tell myself from two days ago:    Save the game, you moron. Save it often, else when you die you have to redo all the things.    The game will not help you on how to play it. Go read some guides and forums to figure out how the game works. Even if that's not 'doing it right,' it is how YOU will have more fun. You like solving puzzles and quests; not puzzling out how your stats work.    Yes, I know you like playing blaster mages, but you'll soon learn that you like playing blaster mages when you have another player acting as a tank to keep the enemies from all rushing you. You will be terrified of everything and die a lot.    While Survivor and Wizard look like cool classes, they are harder to play. You have no strategy yet. Go play a warrior.    While the female warrior is off putting in a chainmail bikini, you will soon pick up more armor and therefore be clothed.    In reference to the above point, it is in your best interest to steal everything you can get ahold of when no one is looking. There are no negative consequences to stealing if you don't get caught.    It is okay to go outside of the village without having finished everything there. In fact do so, kill some orcs, level up, and then go back to the catacombs.    Your fears about the graphics looking bad are baseless, since you've barely played any computer games in the past decade and this is still what you expect computer games to look like.  All in all I'm greatly enjoying myself. I love exploring everywhere I possibly can and this game greatly encourages that.",1
No Death Ruleset classic by Wind at  http://www.twitch.tv/WnxWind  Best JRPG ever made.,1
"Look at the price, buy it, play it. A star wars game without that jedi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",1
"Played the original Xcom back in the day and loved it.  Even when this one is easier to get into, it is not an easy game.  You will feel the death of your soldiers, and you will love it",1
Honestly this game is terribly optimized which arguably shouldn't be a bad review for the game but instead my PC specs... But really with my computer this game should be fine. It isn't,-1
This game is absolute trash. The developers say the Junction system is what's compelling. LOLOLOL that Junction system is one of the main reasons this game is so trash.,-1
"I played this years ago when it came out. Just bought it on Steam, and am rediscovering it. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys open world/apocolyptic rpg type games. Also check out the Nexus for mods to make it even better.",1
"seems like a really cool game, but has crashed on me twice in 40 minutes.",1
"well, i gotta say, i was hyped for this, and turned out to be the best fnaf game in the series.  scott, the game is bootiful (sniff)",1
"It was a rollercoaster.   I liked it, I didn't like it, I liked it, I didn't like it...  In the end I can't truly recommend this one.",-1
This is a game I just can't stop coming back to. Game is great and the dev team keep releasing new content on a very regular basis. The new Rumble mode could easily be a separate game or a paid DLC but they released it for free. Easily the best bang for buck game out there. 100000/10 would play again and again,1
This was awesome game. Totally goes crazy.,1

"First and foremost I want everyone reading this to know that if you don't have friends to play with, or friends that you wouldn't play mario party with (for the sake of friendships not burning into piles of ashes), you probably shouldn't get this game. The single player is fun and all, but usually tipped in the ai's favour, which can be a fun-spoiler sometimes. That said, I've played both campaign and multiplayer, campaign to an extent and multiplayer quite a bit, and overall I'd totally recommend this to people who have others to play it with. Pick up the four-pack while it's on sale. Or while it's not on sale, it's still a pretty good deal.   Into the actual game, this one is a board game in a party style. There are a lot of characters with unique 'hyper' (character-specific, usually pretty cool) cards. These characters are from Orange Juice's other games, and it's a very colourful cast with pretty good character design. The art style is cute, and the game is moderately easy to learn, save for some confusion if you don't read at least the basics of the game's guide (which has its own option to pick on the menu screen when you select/create your profile, so you really don't have an excuse to skip out on that unless you just want to yolo it). It's fairly simplistic, but in the best way I can mean it. Too much complexity can ruin a party game like this. It has a lot of maps to unlock and check out, and a large diversity of cards, a long with some interesting strategies to pull once you've got the hang of it.  Like any game with a lot of characters like this, not all of them are perfectly balanced, so be aware of that.  Overall, I'd give it a 8/10 for what it is, and only really taking off the two points for the cheating AI in campaign and the (kind of) tedious process of unlocking new characters to play (which involves campaign). I really love this game, and I'm glad to have it.",1
Great shooting simulator..Nice..) Waiting for release of Sniper Elite 4,1
This games Autosave system is terrible it can make you lose like 30 minutes of gameplay or even 3 hours. But the rest of the game is awsome instead of this horrific feature,1
Not worth even $1 for me because it just isnt fun. The controls stink. For some reaons your little bug takes 3 times its body length to turn around and the game is all about turning around. Not fun.,-1
BEST GAME IN THE WORLD FINSHED IT 7 times Hell rsieing Overlor 2 dark leagend Mions Love everything about it.,1
Really love the story play in this game =D i have reccomended it to several people,1
Dont Stop Believing!!! or DPS///   Edit: i just noticed its DSB and I dont own that song... also AIDS :/,1
"The only 'Age of' anything worth buying. It's simple enough to get a hold of quickly, and the has enough content to keep you playing for hours on end. Don't forget it's also got multiplayer and steamworkshop.",1
"There is no way to start out, no tutorials, no support. Its all multiplayer camping and hunting the new players. No help from support about safe zones, or anything else. THe game is listed as an empire RPG, but its just a mele free for all thats nothing like what is described.",-1
this game is nice to paly :),1
this game is really fun! you should all play it because its da best,1
Don't think twice. Buy this game.,1

"I played a lot of Saints Row IV and love the game. Now this piece of bull feces is nothing like it. Everything feels different and much less polished, starting even with the controls that feel like the cheapest console conversion that ever crawled out of the depths of hell.  Gat out of this game while you still can! Preferable before wasting your money.",-1
"Now, that's a game! Very enjoyable and well done. If you prefer good story over action scenes realism, L.A. Noire is for you.",1
Literally the greatest game of all time.,1
the african likes the caucasian love,1
Why i have low fps   but nice game :D,1
Broken game. Online is buggy and laggy. Not playable at all. Zero support. Last patch was in novermber 2013 and solves nothing. Read forum of this game for detailed information. There is no sutisfied gamers. NONE. Save u money and dont support such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports. There is much better playable games here.  If u want to play alone in single then its ok. But u will get bored playing vs cpu after compaign,-1
Shogun is way better,-1
"Game is very cool, don't know why all the negative comments, i played, Guild Wars 2, Lineage 2, WOW and Diablo 3, so this game is a child of all of them, a open world MMO ARPG with PVP and online interactions! It has dungeons queues, pvp arena queues co-op quests and you actually see other players and interact with them in this game. It has all that diablo 3 lacks and the gameplay is quite good! I only wish more class's and profession. But for now the game look awesome for a free to play! Give it a try if you are a fan of MMO/ARPG/RPG!",1
"It's a great game for sure, but it has some really big problems. First off, the que's, I'm talking 30 minute plus ****** que's. They NEED to fix that. Also, the currency, at the moment, it is quite hard to get. To get 1000 of the store 'cubits', it takes 10-15 dungeons. And you can only do it once a day. And 80% of the stuff in the store is only purchaseable with the premium credits. So as I do recommned this game, it has some flaws. Overall, 7/10",1
"This is a good game, only reason I'm marking it down is that you don't want to buy this. Buy the Chaos Edition instead, with a couple more races added.",-1
"It's free, fun, and the only things you need to pay to get are cosmetic items only.",1
"I have loved this game since it came out in Japan, and I was grateful to be able to support the creator finally. It is so polished. Those glorious pixels are so well done. The game play is decidedly Cave influenced with Layer Section type lock on missiles. It is also the right amount of difficult. Just enough to be challenging but not enough to be impossible. What this small dev team(doujin circle) have made is nothing short of amazing and put larger groups to shame.",1
Best stealth game ever.Very good optimization,1
Less tolerable than Pokemon TCG,-1
"Before purchasing this game, the lack of goat in my was too overwhelming. I struggled to make a goating that was enough to baaa my children at night. Now that I have found this amazing game, doctors hate me.",1
The most amazingly horrific rouguish LoZish action game ever made.  This is the original there is a remake available with more content but if you want this i suggest it since it's fairly cheap in my opinion.  just be prepared to be killed horribly by whatever lurks in the basement.,1
can't tell if quitting awesomenauts for this was a good plan or just a gateway drug  but ima tree,1
"When a zombie outbreak occurs, four survivors of different ages, walks of life, and hobbies must learn to put aside their differnces and band together in a poignant and touching show of humanity's ability to put aside differences and work for the greater good and our true willingness to care for one another and put ourselves in jeopardy because it's the right thing to do.  A beauty expressed in violence against infected undead.",1
"Yeah, it isn't a good game. If you want a cool Aliens shooter, get AvP.",-1
Wanna be a hipster? Talk about this game. This game got almost no appraise on release and I have no idea why. Its one of the funniest games in a generation and the gameplay holds up even today. This title needs more fans...,1
"im starting to get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off ive been wanting to play this game since i played the demo at a walmart years ago. i finally have the money to buy it and i did, then i had to wait several months to download it because i didnt have wifi anymore. now i finally have wifi and installed it 5 days ago and it wont go past the load screen. idk wth is going on my computer should be more than capable to run it, ive re-installed it 7 times and checked the files integrity 5 times not including today, but i still cant play it, idk whats going on, i have both kotor games and they play fine, why wont a slightly newer game work now :/. if anyone can give me advise on how to get this supposedly amazing game working i will literally kiss your ♥♥♥. seriously though someone please help me.... your my only hope",1
I love this game.... i would never have thought it was this amazing... got additected to it within first 10 minutes.... really bad ♥♥♥ tutorial fight as well. 10/10 Would and will play Dark Souls 2!!!,1
It's too complicated. And I dislike this eye-candy-sci-fi-portal look.,-1
Simply one of the best games ever.,1
"Brilliant FPS, with humor and style. Tense action whth lots of adrenaline",1
"Millions were killed in WWII, a war created by a Communist Romania hungry for Fascist Hungary. Best General Simulator in the World !",1
this game is amazing i really enjoyed it.,1
"3 factions. 6 classes. 14 vehicles. 4 giant maps (continents). Basebuilding. Infantry, vehicle, and air combat. 100v100 (AND EVEN BIGGER!) battles. Endless customizations to suit ANY playstyle. Emphasis on teamwork. Reasonable progression without paying any money. Dedicated playerbase consisting of a lot of PS1 vets.  Aside from a few bugs, this game is a gem. AND IT'S FREE.  The game does have quite the learning curve, though. At almost 400 hours in I'm still learning some things.",1
"I´ve heard about the problems with this game so I tryed it out myself.  First I could not connect to the servers, then I continued offline, then it crashed. Twice  If you want to read more stuff like this just visit the community hub.   1 out of 10 Mana.  Wizards does not know ♥♥♥♥ about digital games so far. Let´s hope for a better future.",-1

It's pretty cute,1
omg addictive.,1

The game is so hard to play alone. COOP is important but this game just forces it on you. The missions are repetive. The flying is the only redeeming part.,-1
Masterpiece by CD projekt Red. Recommended to anyone who likes the witcher series.,1
Awesome coop game.  Buy it and force your friends to buy it!,1
"I can't speak about the online multiplayer because I have been unable to get a game in that, but the campaign (1 and 2 player) is very enjoyable and can be quite challenging at times.   This includes Shooter and its sequel with updated graphics.  I recommend buying this instead of Shooter alone because once you play Shooter, you will want the sequel.",1
"This game will trick you out of your money. First: download it. Second: see if you can take it. Third: either wait a year for it to be a real game or play with bots that are only the enemy and just.........  Oh sorry are you waiting? Here it is...... you'll see it...... right... about... now... here it is, Forget that this game ever existed.",-1

"AMAZING GAME. The concept is great. What was good about Sanctum 1 is made even better by Sanctum 2. Graphics, Monsters, feels more like an FPS and still has the tower elements. I can't say enough good things about this. Easily a $40 game.",1
Really fun but to play i advice u to change some settings as when glass smashes the frames drop i think it is a physics setting.,1
Im addicted to this game and I dont know how to stop,1
"This is a simple game. Push right to move clockwise and left to move counterclockwise. However, it's a difficult one to master. There are six levels in Super Hexagon. Each level is very challenging and requires practice to navigate the traps that will fly towards you. You will need to learn to look towards the edge of the screen to see what is coming next while also looking at the center of the screen to guide your triangle away from death.  What puts Super Hexagon above other similar games is how addictive it is to play 'just one more round'. Beating a level takes a lot of practice, but only takes 60 seconds to count as a victory. Restarting a level only takes pushing a button and you're right back in the game. This combination of short levels and quick restarts greatly reduces its frustration factor and teaches the player to practice, practice, and practice more to learn the tricks and traps in each level and finally hit that minute mark. Once you do pass a stage, you will have that feeling of accomplishment. This feeling seems to be missing from other, more complex games which makes Super Hexagon a great experience.  The feeling of progression is also stronge here. At first you will die within seconds of starting the first stage. It'll be hard to judge what the game is going to throw at you and how much to move left and right to safely dodge the obstacles. With repeated attempts, you will begin to last for 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and on and on until you finally reach that minute mark and beyond. Even after you think you have reached your peak skill, you may set a new personal record that will surprise you. Super Hexagon trains your brain and hands to react immediately and the improvement over time is noticable.  The music is another highlight for the game. The soundtrack consists of three chiptune tracks by the artist Chipzel. All three are very catchy and add to the game's style. One great detail about the music is every time you restart a level, the song starts at a different part. This is a great feature since you will be restarting many, many times and listening from the the beginning of a song would get annoying really fast.  For a few bucks, it is worth it. Even better if you get it on sale. Also grab the mobile version for when you're on the road.",1
PROS :  -It is civilization -It is in space (PS: That is personal)  CONS:  -The gameplay is too slow -You don´t seean evolution like in civ 5,1
"This game is a MUST HAVE for anyone that's into side-scrolling super hyperactive platformers. Needless to say, Freedom Planet draws a huge inspiration from the early Sonic The Hedgehog games but as they say, imitation is the best form of flattery. The programmers behind Freedom Planet manage to take the core gameplay elements of classic Sonic games while still keeping their game unique and even original. This game isn't exactly like Sonic though, different characters have different mechanics, like Carol isn't as focused on speed as Lilac, so instead her levels focus a little more on combat kind of similar to a beat em-up kind of platformer. Not only is the gameplay fantastic but the characters each have their own distinct personalities and characteristics which enriches the gameplay even more. Another big thing this game is focused on, if not the biggest thing, is the story. If you go into the story with the mindset of looking for some kind of super depth and complexity then STOP right now. The story isn't bad and it isn't super great but it's something that really ENTICES the gameplay and sets you into the mood more. There are cutscenes that last up 10 minutes, so it makes completing levels more rewarding and the BOSS battles are just insane!!! I CANT REMEMBER taking on bosses this EPIC! The bosses are challenging but also the animation and sequences into the boss battles are just spec-♥♥♥♥ING-tacular. NOW I KNOW that you're tired of me rambling on and on about this game but if you really want a GREAT 2D platforming experience ESPECIALLY if you miss the glory gameplay of Sonic The Hedgehog series, then this game IS For YOU!! Buy it and support it. There's a reason why this game is coming to PS4 and Wii U/3Ds eShop. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD!",1
Very unexpectable ending of the trilogy. In that one particulary Rufus now understands that he needs just to let go and   DIES   How Daedalic.,1
i expected a long game :/ new to metal gear and bought this as my first game !! wow gg :3 anyway its great series,1
"If you want to have a team-based game which includes destroying all the zombies you can see, plus having the option of utilizing a wide array of weapons, then you should definately pick up a copy of 'Left 4 Dead 2'. New user-friendly (Co-op; Versus not so much), Left 4 Dead 2 gets you right into the action as soon as you start a game, and the controls are those of a first-person-shooter, making the transition to the game easy and painless.",1
"This game has and thought of everything. Its a fantastic adventure filled with unexpected suprises through the entire game. Great storyline, super visuals, cute and great characters. Its a game i have been wanting to play for a long time but never knew existed.",1
"I've spent most of my gaming years playing FPS and wanted to change up to controller based games. Controller or not, this is just one of the funnest games I've ever played, I wish it way longer! The graphics are sick, and everything was just really well thought out. I cannot wait for anything from this title in the future",1
Retro first-person shooter acton FTW!,1
Yes very robbery much graphic 12/1.4,1
it's fun for about 5 sec... after that the game has finished loading...,-1
Beautiful graphics and primitave controls that made the game overly difficult to control. Truck Simulator and Train sim are a joy to run but Farming simulator is a bust. Glad I got it on sale so it wasn't to hard to delete it.,-1
"This is definitively the best open world game I have ever played. Hours of playtime, numerous restarts and rerolls. it just never gets old. the Nexus mod community keeps this game going forever.",1
Review can be found here  crowdcontrolreviews.uk/middleearth-shadowofmordorreview.html ,1
"This is a great game! Even better if you play with friends over skype, makes it alot better :)",1
"I never got very far through the first ME, so the controls are a bit overwhelming at first.",1
Classic game I still like it. It should be cheaper.,1
This game is incredibly detailed and informative and is a must have for anyone interested in firearms. The library of available models is massive and it is possible to recommend new models. Some complain about the 'paywall' that guns are behind however grinding exp and credits is possible and the quality is worth throwing a few dollars towards a pack or credits/exp boost.,1
"This game is amazing! The replay value is through the roof. There are so many different paths to take, so many ways to struggle, die or thrive.  10/10 would die by chocolate again",1
I hate top down games... usually but this kickass retro 80s game that is very violent and plays great music is a must play. A great fast paced arcade game where you go to buildings in your unicorn mask kicking peoples heads in and smashing them with a lead pipe. 10/10 would murder again,1
"[A sadistic Mother whom is hell-bent on killing her son, Isaac. Features seven different characters, randomised levels and drops! Very replayable. If you are finished with the campaign and are getting bored you could always install spider mod for some varying options for challenges etc.] - Original Binding of Isaac review.  Not much has changed about this view except the part detailing the spider mod. I would, however, like to add that everything in this version(If I could even call this a version - more like a remodle) has been amped up: The graphics, The amount of items, map varieties, enemies, drops, improved language platform (coding wise), etc. If you enjoyed the original, then buy this. If you want to try out Binding of Isaac, buy this. If you even think you hate this game, buy this. Any of the faults from the original game - which I didn't even notice half the time! - has been taken out!  Overall: BUY THIS GAME! It is way better than the original in all aspects!",1
"Banished is amazing. It pretty-much hits the spot for the survival, city-builder, colonization game I've always wanted. I find it casual, challenging and charming all at the same time. I kind of wish it had a little more material to it, but It's pretty well balanced and tuned - I won't complain. Does it have a few buggers that are frusterating? Sure, but you can work around them. Might it take you a few tries and a little bit of trial and error? Yes, and I like it that way.   I like that there's a bit of a gamble and almost a NEED to leave room for error. I honestly doubt that there is a formula to playing this game. There's an over - all progression path you'll have to follow and build up to, but you'll have to always be making tough calls and decisions.  Banished has more than meets the eye - it's reminded me of games I sunk thousands of hours into of a different era, like Rollar Coaster Tycoon, that I'm perfectly content to play for a while.  Now with mod support, the lack of material and further progression is pretty much nulled. I've already found some mods that act like expansions quite nicely and am re-addicted. (Now all it needs is Mac/Linux support)  Get Banished.",1
"An incredibly fun game! HArd but once you get into it it will hook you into the world and the gameplay. Don't let the gatekeepers keep you from playing. It has it's issues, the random invasions make me want to scream sometimes and the camera can be your worst enemy, But don't let that stop you. Definitely recommend.",1
piece of ♥♥♥♥ for noobs. PS ru community is ugly,1
You can jump on top of a guy's shoulders and kill him but you can't jump a fence shorter than your knees.  One of my top ten games of all time.,1
MEH ITS OK TO KILL 2 HRS OF TIME,1
Hilarious party game.,1
"So at a first glance this seemed like a good SNES style game with good pixel graphics. But thats pretty much all thats good about this game honestly.  Gameplay is very simplistic just going across linear corridors fighting off the same enemies over and over again with the same attacks over and over. Because you keep moving forward in the same direction this game hardly has any 'Metroidvania' elements. The boss battles are fun though, but sometimes can kill you in one hit which gets annoying. And the combat is just 2 attacks depending on what character your playing as it will have different weapons but in the end, they are all the same honestly.  The art style does look good with some character models but the backgrounds are very blurry and repeat the same image. The town areas are really wierd cause then the game turns into an over-head view. And it gets confusing where to go for these towns. The music in this game is enjoyable, it fits well with the current settings of the game if your in town or when your fighting enemies.  Conclusion: It feels like the developers were trying to add in all the great aspects of a lot of games from the 90s, but lost control on making them good in this game. If this game just focused on being a Castlevania type game I think it would be much better. But for what we have here... pass on this one, its barely average.  Rating: 4/10  ",-1
"Really enjoy the game, I brought it direct from AGEOD when it first came out. It is the most detailed Napoleonic pc game I have played and the map looks brilliant too! The campaign is a monster so don't expect to be able to get through a full game too quickly! Don't be put off by the negative reviews as AGEOD are a great company when it comes to supporting and improving their games.",1
"Having no prior knowledge of this game, I found it quite intriging. The story was well crafted and kept me hooked throughout the entirety of it. One of my favorite features is that it doesn't hold your hand. You are encouraged to explore from the get go. This can lead to some frustration when you have to loop back to areas again to find clues that you may have missed. The game, albeit fun and engaging, is a little short. I took a leisurely stroll through it and completed it in 5 hours. The only element that felt out of place was the jump scare. I felt it wasn't needed and could have been left out. Overall, I feel that if you get this on sale it is a fantastic game for the value.",1
"You are Cosmonaut #002145. The task upon is not an easy one. You will be challenge with electrical failures, ghosts, and a No Return Policy. The weapons at your disposal is a big box with letters, and John Madden himself.",1
"An interesting revival for the first-person stealth genre.  Dishonored features an excellent world to explore, and an exaggerated art style which is brilliantly grotesque.  The gameplay is, as to be expected, pared down from games like Thief, and the focus is on assassination rather than thievery, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.",1
Very good and challenging game.,1
Lost my save progress Re-downloaded and will play through it again. thats how good this is,1

"Before reading the below review proper. If you would like a short and blunt summary of what this game is see the following video I did in my series for the final boss. This is the essence of the game once you strip away the fake difficulty, purposefully reimplemented arcade bugs and checkpoint starvation.   http://youtu.be/w7IeweqEFL8   If you really want more than that  here  is the playlist for the series. Now without further ado here is the original review. My final impressions have not changed after completing the game.   You know. I had almost forgotten why I never really had any nostalgic feelings towards arcade games that inspired this one. What with their stiff controls, sparse checkpoints/continues for more efficient padding and quarter poaching, edge of screen spawning of enemies and other such fake difficulty. It's always nice to have a game come along and remind me. Funny thing is, the edge of screen spawning was actually technically justified at the time due to memory/sprite constraints and the state keeping issues that entailed. Now? Not so much.  If you want a real game that takes the pleasing challenge of arcades but doesn't rely on 'but teh retro' as an excuse for its shortcomings check out something like They Bleed Pixels. That said though, be sure you look at the manual for this. They did a really great job on it making it look like how manuals used to look back when they were interesting and filled with lore (Zelda's manual being the most famous for example).  Oh and to answer the question a lot of people may have about this. No. There is no pre-boss checkpoints. You die and you have to do the whole level again. This isn't challenging, it's padding. Bad padding at that.  Anyway, I noticed that the mouthbreather brigade was telling people that they didn't like it because it was challenging and they couldn't win (as well as calling people 'kid' when their argument is called out, proving yet again that they're mostly kids themselves that don't have the slightest clue what these games were about and yet put on a facade of nostalgia), I decided to finish the first world (update: make that the entire game). I'm kind of glad too because it gave me more ammo in the form of  this nonsense .  I remember those games too. But you're deluded if you think that you have the same ability to give these ultimatums that lazy companies who didn't want to do battery backups did in the 80s and 90s. Once again, this isn't challenging or a homage. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between features and technical workarounds.",-1
"Meh. It's ok. I guess. Sorta. From a technical standpoint everything works ok. The problem is I got bored of it after about thirty minutes. It's a more simplistic game that Golden Axe, which is pretty inexcusable given its price and how old Golden Axe is. If you want to play a scrolling beat 'em up, go get a Mega Drive emulator and play Streets of Rage 2.",-1
It's amazing.,1
horrible i want a refund,-1
"I enjoyed this game. It has great art direction, memorable characters, and a fantastic story. I also felt that the game carries a nice shift from hack and slash combat to full out RTS battles which got pretty challenging in the end.  I'm not a fan of RTS games in general, but I've heard the controls and ability to manage troops are somewhat limited in this game. Some people might not be big fans of metal music or familiar with some of it's icons.  That said, I still enjoyed the game immensely and I hope you do too :]",1
"I can´t believe this game is on sale for 1,49€. I´m somehow happy that I have paid more. It´s an incredibly authentic game with lovely featured characters and landscapes. Do not expect a AAA title with extremly high resolutions and the budget was limited of course, but the way it´s designed has got its own charm.",1
its really good but IT IS PAY TO WIN,-1
"If your into planning, resources, base and troop management, researching, turned based sci-fi combat, aliens, conspiracies and X Files like crazy s*** and any other weird things, then you should play this game, if you havent already. With its new DLC XCOM: Enemy Within (EW), and what I think is called Slingshot, many cool new features have been added, such as gene research, mech units, better/tweaked game mechanics have been added and changed to really improve the game and much more!   The addition of these new missions and DLC has greatly improved the life of a already fun game. Though with Steam, it does making trying to mod the game to add new units or harder/unique playthroughs or overhauls much harder so I didnt attempt it much. Either way, moded or not, its still worth the few bucks for the DLC (or the whole game itself, if you dont already have it) I'd say.",1
this game is amazing. The ending of the game will leave you speechless and utterly confused. the story is amazing and the gammeplay is even better. 11/10 would recommend to all.,1
Wish there were more.,1
"Very addictive city builder, with a great sense of humor. Did find some islands a little annoying without the DLCs though. 9/10",1

"This is one of the few 'free 2 play with microtransations' FPS games I've invested so much time in without actually regretting it (the only other I can remember is Combat Arms when it first came out...I DON'T recommend playing that game nowadays, however). Blacklight: Retribution isn't perfect, but it's damn good for the cost of $0. Highly polished if you have the rig for it, and featuring the innovative HRV feature, Retribution is not only a better game than it's predessor but a testament to the idea that a free game can be just as good - if not better - than a 60 dollar one.",1
♥♥♥♥ this game forever,-1
Thought I would wait either until it's on sale or an update came out.   I couldn't wait....  Amazing gameplay. Graphics are decent too. Fills that void for a good RTS/FPS game.   7/10 - Maybe a higher score as the game gets updated.,1
"A fast-paced, beautiful and entertaining tabletop with some of the most charismatic characters ever seen in a pick-up-and-play game? Sign me up!  In Armello, you take turns with your opponents in a closed 10-rounds match that will decide the future of a kingdom in ruins. There are different gameplay strategies that you can adopt, the rules are easy to master (though it does have some meta with the whole item system) and soon you will be holding grudges against one or other character, just like in a good board game.  Since this is a board game presented in a digital medium, it does make use of great graphics and sound to improve the experience. Everything in Armello is animated (even the CARDS), the SFX are good and the music is calm and fitting. Also, if you like talking animals (or furries, admit it) you will probably love the characters in the game. Their animations and style are strikingly good, and on top of that each one has their own perks, adding more replay value.  All in all, it's easy to see that the game was developed by a team who loves what they do. Great attention to detail, polished UI, and just enough content to justify the time and money spent on it. Only criticism I have is not even related to the game itself: I find it hard to find other players for multiplayer matches.  One of my favorite casual games in a while, and certainly one I would recommend to anyone who enjoys tabletop games.",1
"It has great gamemodes,graphics and gameplay its great for ages 10-20 or up even 7 year olds play it ITS GREAT.Btw if buyed it download cinema and go on cereal box cimena.ITS GREAT!!!!!! ",1

"  Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Overkill Software.The game consists of a variety of 'heists' that a player can opt to either carry out by themselves, with the AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are heists such as bank robbery, a drug trafficking run, and rigging an election. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion.Ok, now you know a short summary about this game I show the pros and cons:",1
"Addictive as ♥♥♥♥. Its a game about bank heists, if you think you will like it, you definitely will.",1
"Just awesome. Once you reach level 25, the game became non-stop action.",1
"This review is for everybody who, unlike most of the negative reviewers in this thread, don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ with what other people do with their money. Seriously people? 'Not Recommended' because there are micro transactions? I'm so sick of the 'gaming' community crying about micro-transactions, or any other way for studios to make profit. Game prices have not gone up in nearly 30 YEARS. Go check SNES game prices when they were new. NBA Jam was $80 at Toys R Us when it came out. That's equal to $133 at today's rates. Game prices have become exponentially more expensive to make as the market has grown, and yet the prices have gone DOWN because volume has increased. And yet, entitled pieces of ♥♥♥♥ come in here and try and shame developers for trying to make up for a revenue gap by selling single player perks for $4. If somebody wants to skip the leveling up system and pay for Praxis kits, WHO CARES? Why are you going to write a negative review for the game because of what Timmy wants to spend his allowance on?   Here's a real game review:  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Overall score 8.5/10  Graphics: 9/10  Simply put the game looks amazing. The lip sync animations are a little clunky and some of the character animations are a little funky but overall I've found myself spending most of my short time in this game exploring every nook and cranny.  Sound: 8/10  The levels are a little off at points i.e. the voices of people around you are louder than the machine gun in your hands that you are shooting. But overall the soundtrack is really enjoyable and the ambient sound is really immersive. NPC dialogue is plentiful and pretty interesting to eavesdrop on. Melee and take down sound effects are super satisfying.  Controls: 8/10  The only thing that I really gotta knock is the mouse acceleration. I had to turn it to 0 in order to even play the game, but once I had it set to 0 it felt fine. Should be an easy hot fix. Beyond that the control scheme is not typical and takes a little getting used to with the odd cover system but once you get it down it feels fine.  Gameplay: 9/10  They did an excellent job at making you able to control the way you approach levels. Just in the first few missions I could already identify that there were several ways to achieve your objective. The replay factor is definitely there. Add on top of that the simple and fast quick save/load feature and you have yourself so many opportunities to experiment.   Now let's address the ♥♥♥♥ talk:  Micro transactions - Seriously? You're going to NOT recommend this amazing title because they decided they needed another form of revenue? It's a single player game people. Why do you care what others do with their $4? Back when I was a kid my neighbor bought a Game Genie. We spent hours messing with games and seeing how we could break them. Today he'd be burnt at the stake. I could care less if you decide to spend an extra $20 on praxis kits. Honestly, you're downgrading your experience if you do though because leveling up is part of the challenge of this game. There is absolutely NO reason why optional micro transactions for a single player experience should affect the overall rating of this game. None. If you factor that in, ♥♥♥♥ you.  DLC - Ok, so people are supposedly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about 'one time use' DLC. Maybe if they took two seconds to read what the DLC was they wouldn't have spent their money. From what I've seen it consists of character skins, weapons skins, and things like extra praxis kits and health stims. Some morons out there are literally complaining about praxis kits being one time use. What the ♥♥♥♥ did you expect? You expected to get an unlimited use praxis kit so you can max level in the first 30 seconds of the game? So let me get this straight... the community here on Steam DOESN'T like the fact that you can pay for praxis kits in your personal, single player game. At the same time they also DON'T like the fact that the praxis kit they paid for by pre-ordering isn't unlimited use... SM♥♥♥♥inH.  Technical issues - NEVER, I repeat, NEVER in the history of PC gaming has 100% hardware compatibility been achieved. My parents bought me Star Wars: Dark Forces when I was a kid and it crashed our Gateway PC so many times. The polygon and kotaku articles about Deus Ex's technical issues are seriously so minor they are not worth the pixels they are displayed on. This Polygon article:  http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/24/12622774/deus-ex-pc-mess  cite TWO Steam reviews as their source material for Deus Ex being 'Kind of a Mess'. Seriously? If I spent two minutes on Twitter I could find two people to complain about anything. That does not make a news article. On top of that the technical issues they address are the mouse acceleration I mentioned above, and a few minor crashing issues which the developers have already publicly addressed. Queue the Reddit hive mind hate-wagon to ♥♥♥♥ talk and drive this game in to the ground.  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has met and surpassed what Human Revolution was. If you liked that game then this is a must buy. If you have technical issues, do what every PC player has had to do several times and troubleshoot. If you don't reach two hours of in game time Steam will refund you. What is there to lose? ",1
"Great game, much like Team Fortress 2 but doesn't have tradeable items (Thank Goodness).",1
"This game has been around for a while, and whilst i've been aware of it, I been too busy playing all the prettier AAA games to get round to this.  First off, I see a lot negative reviews relate to the graphics running slowly. I too had some slowdown issues at certain points, but adjusting the Direct X choice from within the game menus sorted it out completely.   Onto the game.  Pros This is a great 2D sidescoller. If this was a simple run and gun then it wouldn't have held my interest. However, the map holds many secrets and routes that change as your abilities increase throughout the game. The combat is reasonably basic, but fun nonetheless. You feel overpowered for most of the game, which for me made it more enjoyable. It didn't at any time feel like a slog. The game also provides an excellent map system, plus clear instructions on exactly where you need to go and what your objectives are at all times. Without this, I certainly would have got lost on the sprawling map.  Shadow Complex draws inspiration from many games. This is no bad thing, since many of them are some of my favourites.  If you are old enough to remember Sabatuer 2 on the Spectrum then this will seem familiar to you, however the most obvious comparison is with Metroid (not a bad thing!)  Cons Nolan North's voice acting is as good as you would expect, but the dialogue and plot are not the most interesting. however, this did not detract from the game at all for me. A sign of a good game for me is one that I can't stop playing until i complete it. This was one of those. It took me aroun 10 hours and I enjoyed all of it.   So in conclusion, if your not expecting an intricate plot and especially if you enjoyed Metroid, I highly recommend Shadow Complex.",1
Best strategy game EVER,1

"In my personal opinion, this game sucks. It's pay to win, the controls are impossible, they don't have a mute so mic spam away trolls, and the community is terrible. It's free, but if your a free player then stick with TF2, this is no good.",-1
"One of the best new generation of point and click adventure games. This one has amazing artwork, great voice acting, a really fresh and interesting story and a great 'feels like a movie' pacing that makes it super fun for the whole family to play and enjoy together. My six year old played through this one twice, almost entirely on her own. It is one of her all time favourites and one of my favourite for her to play. A great game, family friendly and fun for all ages. This is a perfect example of how video games are the new form of literature.",1
this game is almost 10 years old and it's still really good.,1
"The game is good. Low scores press and players were given for the fact that it has no significant changes. So the developers themselves say that they will not make a radically new. Thus, the game killed themselves fans who were hoping for a level of development Rotsksteady. But the game came out very good. But the main drawback - the bugs that are corrected gradually but one bug that there was at me in the game (side quest Birds) I had to remove savegame and all of my time I spent in the game was spent in vain. As a result, we have a very good single player, multiplayer interesting that you need to refine and still a lot of bugs that need to be addressed. Better buy this game will come when all the DLC ,fix all the bugs and preferably on sale (price in Steam is quite high, at least in Russia).",1

This game is just too random for a good strategie game,-1

Another Dev: 'Hmm, what if we make a game that is on either the PLANET moon or Mars, and have random, infinite astriods hitting the player every second for no appearent reason? Whilts having the player be 2-3 feet tall, and him going for objectivess that have little to no impact on no plot what so ever? Another Dev: 'That is a great idea, DOUGHNUTS FOR EVERYONE!'",-1

"While gameplay is finely polished for the most part there are some massive flaws: particularly the open world nature . The environement is essentially lifeless and bland between outposts and the details within the buildings are sparse and lacking. Despite being open world the map (afghanistan in particular) is very linear and allows only a very restrcited travel route along roads (often winding) from one place to the next which often takes forever even by horse.  The main missions are for the most part repetitive and stale and revisit the same areas over and over (the side missions are absolutely tedious because of this).  The story is unfinished (given kojima konami split earlier), uneven, jarring, filled with plot holes and can appear mind boggling and laugheable at times. The characters are unappealing and poorly developed. You'll scratch your head many times trying to understand a plot twist or wacky unprovoked character behaviour...  You'd hope dlc would fix this but it wont given ongoing developer publisher relations and its too widespread and major a problem anyway. A great shame; certainly one of the wackiest and most non sensical games I've ever played (even compared to past mgs).   I've stopped midway through chapter 2 now and have done with the game, its that rubbish; try witcher 3 (100 x better than this) or mad max (unrecognised hit) instead or hold your breath till fallout 4 because this game will leave you frustrated....  I dont recommend this and I struggle to undersatnd how this has been getting perfect scores (no game is perfect even at the best of times)",-1
it....how......how did you know my life ;~;,1

"Full game price for nearly no game at all. Thanks for the good looking graphics, too bad there isn't much else to add as a positive to to the game. Story is boring and short (obviously), gameplay is literally made up of almost completely quick-time events. Its games like this and The Order, that give AAA developers the bad name they sometimes do deserve.",-1
"Wow. That's all I can say. Now I loved The Walking Dead Telltale Game more than this game to be honest. This can be sort of classified as an older Telltale game, with upgraded UI and better graphics. The story is much better than other telltale games, and fortunately, this game's choices makes you think you're doing wrong, when you're actually doing nothing wrong at all. The outcome is going to be initially the same. Happy ending and such, it's more like some will be alive and some will not be alive simple as that. Your choices don't really affect much, but expect to sort of feel like you're playing L.A. Noire at some parts, and don't be discouraged when you find that you did not make a 'majority decision,' meaning you didn't make the choice most others made. I also love that you'll notice some familiar voices in this game, as notable characters are actually major characters in the Walking Dead Game. Most noticeably, you'll find that Beauty (from Beauty and the Beast) and TJ (Toad's son) are both voiced by the same voice actor as Clementine. Also, Bluebeard is the same voice actor as Lee Everett. It seems like Snow White is voiced by Carly from the game as well, but I haven't confirmed that yet. The game is so amazing, and for some reason, I kind of like Quick Time Events, so every part of this game is amazing. You might feel a little bored during the first and second episode, but trust me it really keeps up. As Telltale has already said in pictures, this is a 'Telltale Games SERIES.' Meaning, they will be making a second season for this game, and I honestly cannot wait.   ---SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT--- SO at the VERY end of the game, there is a sudden twist that shocked the hell out of me, and may be confusing to a lot of people. Thankfully there's YouTube videos covering some of the theories. Also, you really expect to hook up with Snow around the end of the game, especially at the beginning of episode 4. I felt so disappointed, because I love video game romances, especially Telltale ones. I mean I can't be the only one who REALLY wanted Carly to live in The Walking Dead, just so Lee could maybe hook up with her. Episode 3 and 5 are really going to get you into the game, because honestly, I was shouting at my screen for most of it. Episode 3 is intense, and a LOT of episode 5 happens really fast, and that particular episode, is kind of depressing to be honest. I personally loved this series so much, and I'm so glad that Telltale brought familiar voice actors in. Another added fact is that you'll recognize a LOT if not all the fairy tales mentioned in this game! It's so badass! Anyway, loved the game so much. 9/10.",1
"I had a hard time liking it at first. It was very difficult to understand coming straight from Unity of Command (which is also a great game) and was unprepared for what lay before me. After a while of learning little tricks and taking time to understand the pros and cons of the units I began to play more. I am playing the grand campaign of the base game now. I am at Operation Sea Lion 40' after demolishing Poland, Belgium, and France in decisive victories. Its a great game for many other reasons. One being that it has the minor countries in it as well as the large ones. Romania, Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Belgium, and others. The only one it doesnt have is Finland but in the Soviet Corps that is coming out soon I saw it in there. I love this game so much now. I cant wait to play even more when I get the many expansions for the game.  pros:  - Large variety of units and countries  -You can limit/turn off RNG rolls (I turn RNG off so that what it says might happen will happen)  -Many other stuff  cons:  -Bit of a learning curve  -Nothing else really  So if you feel like it go out there and buy the game. It's Awesome!!!!",1
The game is good but the AI on the bosses is cheap. The bosses in act 1 are to powerfull.,1
"The game is entertaining. Reachable achievements and Steam Trading Cards kept me going. Overall good game if you like jigsaw puzzles. I got this game in a bundle of ~8 games for $2 or $3. For that price, it's worth it. However, I would not pay $10 for it. I would probably pay up to $5 for it so I recommend only buying it when it's on sale. Also, I want to punch the fairy in the face.   Overall score: 9/10  Edit: I just found out from another reviewer that you can kill the fairy by pressing delete while in a puzzle. I just raised the score from an 8/10 to a 9/10 because of this. I must have missed this when I first saw the controls because the fairy was yelling at me and said something like 'Hurry up and read this! We need to get started!'.  Edit 2: WARNING! As I just found out, after killing the fairy, you will not get any pixie green goo power crap so you may not want to do it.",1
It's good.,1
"The 'tycoon' style of building your empire can be fun, doing jobs, renting and building establishments, but there's nothing else to it. Just buying, selling and building, with the odd job here and there. Granted that each map gets bigger and has more oppourtunities, it really dosen't give much else to do. You'll spend time just watching over, micro managing, or even not managing at all.  The combat system feels like an XCOM style system. Granted that again there isn't much to it, just taking cover, shooting over cover, killing badguys and stealing loot, you'd get more fun out of an XCOM game. Granted you can play using perma-death rules, the only real penalties for losing mob members is a slow down in activities during the tycoon stage, and the invevitable game over.  Overall if the two sections were fleshed out more and felt better to play with, it'd be more fun. A good game that lacks substance but, if it had said substance it'd be an awesome game. Still if you planning on grabbing it, watch it go on sale.",1
Quite possibly the greatest shooter of all time. 'Nuff said.,1
This game is beauty in every sense of the word. It has a powerful story filled with great characters! It will honestly be remembered as a classic for decades!! This game takes you on a whole nother level of story telling! It's worth every cent and it's something everyone should own and play! So would you kindly buy this game???,1
"Sick game, very fun to play, but wish it had coop. It's nice to see a Rogue-like with a /bit/ of progression too.",1
One of those games where the art style or lack thereof adds to the games charm in my opinion. It's certainly not an easy game but it is responsive and a lot of fun to play.,1
"I got this game after No man's sky failed to scratch an itch. By which I mean I was disappointed and angry at it. I was No man's sky's wife, and it forgot our anniversary. It was out with it's mate, Sean Murray, drinking down at the Dog and duck and I cooked a nice dinner. It went cold. It made alot of promises when we first got together. Said it was going to show me the universe. It lied.   This is better than that. This game will treat you like the princess you are.   I'll get off the bad marriage analogy thing now...  This is not an easy pick up and play game. It takes some learning. But once you've learnt the basics like navigating, docking and how to make money you're golden.   It's also not a constant white knuckle thrill ride. You won't be getting your endorphin fix whilst pulling off head shots doing bicep curls and necking Red Bull with your bros. Theres alot of doing nothing. This is the sort of game you can put some music, have a cup of herbal tea on disappear for a few hours.  I'm still learning about it now. There's buttons on my keyboard that I don't know what they do and I haven't really touched combat yet but I hear it's the ♥♥♥♥. I even went full nerd and got a HOTAS. That's a flight stick. I already have a nice ♥♥♥♥. See what I did there?! Theres loads left to see and their still not finished adding to it.   All in all. Take the kids off the hook. Put the phone to bed. Boil the wife. Kiss the Kettle goodnight and get it.",1

"This BS has become so pay2play! It was fun at first, but once weapon skins, safes, and drills were implemented the devs true interests were revealed. Oh and 30 FUGGIN DLC!!?? WTF Overkill!? You must be trying out perform EA and Ubisoft on there amazing customer satisfaction! ( Cough Cough )",-1

"If you have played The Binding of Isaac/Hotline Miami and enjoyed it/then, then holy ♥♥♥♥ you need to check out this game, i can barely say anything that's majorly wrong with it honestly.  Pros:  Alot of things.  Cons:   Not alot of things.",1
Brilliantly immersive game.,1
"The game available to you here is an artifact to what was an MMO. This title stands alone as a very ambitious project to create a collaborative multiplayer game where the focus is on exploration and puzzle solving, not on combat.  You can see the lessons learned from Uru as they play out in other MMOs -- specifically with The Secret World's investigation missions.",1

An Amazing game. A wonderful Blend of many styles of games that are very well done. Way better than the first evoland and I loved the first evoland. A must play if you grew up playing games.,1
Played the beta a while ago before it was even on steam. great for if you have time to spare.,1
I played the hell out of this and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,-1
10/10 would begin again,1
"After playing this game ,i cant get any sleep. my mind is full of nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan.",1
"If you come from the first Bioshock to this one, I think it will be a lesser experience but I consider that to be rather subjective.  It's more Bioshock. If you like the gameplay, the style of it, the atmosphere, the story of the first one, you will be able to enjoy this game. Being a Big Daddy is rather fun but I did prefer being a regular human being saving little sisters from Big Daddies.  I will say this - if you are going on a Bioshock binge and you're coming from Infinite without having played 1 and 2, I suggest starting with 2 because the experience will be better due to the contrast with the first one. First one will feel fresher, more engaging, better story driven and more atmospheric (tho both games handle that part rather well). Shorter tho, I think Bioshock 2 is shorter than the first one.",1
"While the first SW KOTOR tells a better story, SW KOTOR II -The Sith Lords has better graphics and controls including nicer inventory and character development trees etc. Basically the identical setup just nicer more user friendly and visually appealing gameplay.",1
"Will keep this relatively short - I find this to be a pleasing little game particularly the gathering and crafting aspects. However I quickly found frustration in the extremely limited inventory space making spending $$ almost immediately required after about an hour of play simply due to not having space. Most of the materials stack to 5 or maybe 10 before taking up another 'slot', and you've also got to carry around a pickaxe, shears, an axe, a fishing rod...whatever. If you want to actually experience the crafting, prepare to shell out some cash to even have room to do anything. I spent more time reorganising my inventory (or running allll the way back to the bank and/or vendors) than I did anything else. A shame, really, because it has a lot of potential.",-1
This game has to be one of the most frustrating games I have ever played in my life and yet I cannot seem to stop playing. The graphics are amazing and even on a lower-end machine it plays smooth.  Just be prepared to die.. a lot... and then some.,1
"Actually not bad, it is similar to dead ops arcade zombies on black ops except you can buy barracks and different weapons.",1
When this game started it sucked then developers said we wont sell any dlcs all addons will be for free..♥♥♥♥ing liars  put more maps cuz u suck!,-1
Way too slow. I was already bored within the first five minutes. It talks about monotonous things that have no meaning or impact on the story. It was like putting pictures to a Charles Dickens book. Good thing this is free.,-1
"Fun, once you get good at jumping and using the time slow feature it is quite rewarding. Want more of this game.",1
"so glorious, so good, the humor and just the narrator alone is worth buying this game",1
Awesome game. Play it. Or my puppy will eat your face! Guess who's the father =o),1
"Review might change after a while. This is a day 1 Review after a couple of hours playing.  So far, so great a Dark Souls i hoped it would be. Tough, unforgiving but fair. I didnt even care, that there is a two class system of treating gamers. The streamers shall have their fun with a pre-release and make my mouth watery. BUT.. it is pure evil MADNESS(!) that the devs didnt manage to get rid of game-breaking bugs like the bonefire-crash-to-desktop Bug. Are you serious? Pre releasing almost over a month early for the 'noble' but once I, the normal folksman (and friggin many others), get my hands on that product, that game isnt even playable? I can't leave the bonefire without some strange moves like fast traveling before, or that 'low setting'-crap that is mentioned as a workaround. In a game, where you respawn at a bonefire more often than changing tissues to wipe the tears off your face after a death? That is crucial. I don't care about Day-1-Bugs and Crashes but I do care for 'pre-release+1 day'-Bugs and Crashes. Do your friggin homework and fix that crap asap, or I'll order a refund and wait for the 'bugfixed -80% steamsale'-Release",-1
Best game out there. Just buy it and sink a huge chunk of your leasure time into it. You will not regret it.,1
This game has a lot of content that allows for many hours of enjoyable gameplay. It's fun to play alone or with friends.,1
Pros:   - Happy that I'm able to play this on my computer and through Steam link! - Feelings of nostalgia are over 9000  Cons:  - No support for wide screen or 16:9 aspect ratio - Not improvements to graphics,1
"Dungeon Master / Eye of the Beholder / Legend of Grimrock dungeon crawl, but with pausable tank/healer/damage based combat mechanics replacing the real time 'square dance' action combat of those titles. So far I love it.  I'm a classic cRPG fan going all the way back to Wizardry. I love the aforementioned games, but I'm an old fart that doesn't fancy real time combat. Wizardry's 'choose your actions up front, then watch the turn unfold' is probably my favorite of all time...it combined turn based mechanics while adding a little bit of unpredictable chaos by not having direct control of each action sequentially. I can handle square-dance RT combat (played Grimrock on Hard &amp; Old-school with my graph paper and colored pencils), but turn-based is what I prefer.  FDG is a great compromise between the two. Has the 'feel' of EoB without the silly square-dance routine that quite frankly never made any sense in an RPG anyway. The 'wow' style combat is actually more interesting as a pausable single-player experience than it's ever been in multiplayer for me. It gives the same feel of planning your moves and managing the party as a TB game, while the queueing of actions and watching it play out until you need to intervene helps keep things moving along at a rapid clip for those that might not have the patience for a tranditional TB system.  Note to people who are real-time square dance fans: this is NOT an option in this game. The WoW-style combat is NOT optional. Resetting ability timers during movement prevent you from using this tactic. Do NOT buy this game if you want to 'stick and move' around your foes, you'll be upset. Other than the strategically placed 'dodge' of a special boss ability here and there, you'll be standing toe-to-toe using your tank/healer/damage skills to figure out the 'puzzle' of defeating each particular enemy.  Bottom line, it's Eye of the Beholder with pausable WoW combat, and it does exactly that with great success. If that sounds good to you, you'll love it. If either Tank/Healer/Damage combat OR the inability to 'square dance' your way through battles sounds annoying or stupid to you, you'll hate it.  ",1
"A improvement over the original one that was bundled with Windows 95, but I like the plot for the old one better (Spoilers: the ending of that one was amazing at the time!!)",1
first game i ever played when i was like 3 ♥♥♥♥in dope,1
"One of the best tomb radider games ever made and my personal fav TR game! (TR 2013 is also godlike but I can't compare em cos the 2013 TR is a start to Laras journey without many puzzles and tombs unlike this one which offers lots of puzzles and tombs) Great story,graphich are unreal for that time, epic setting and really good puzzles. If you liked ANY other tomb raider game or any other adventure game like old Indiana Jones games and stuff like that this is a MUST!!!  10/10",1
I read the reviews. THEY WERE RIGHT!,-1
yea this game is awsome,1
"I owned the original version of this game way back in the earlier 2000's and was sad to see one of my favorite games fall to compatability issue when I upgraded to Windows 7, this is the answer, the game is practically identical to the original version, and there's nothing wrong with that, I never really got into Age of Empires 3 but I loved Age of Empires 2, I didn't want any 'advanced game mechanics' or 'high end graphics', I wanted the exact same game I had before and that's exactly what I got.  Thanks Steam, You always pull through for me.",1
"The name says it all. The mount gives you inertia; the blade, opportunity.",1
"This game is all the fun of pulling fingernails of with pilers but without the progress. After ten minutes I was done, considering that some of the best Rogue-like's are free this falls short and if it's aim is to be a puzzle game then it fall short on that as well. Good concept, poor execution.",-1
One of my favorite games! -Stunning visuals. -Perfect combat system. -Gripping main and side stories. I can only recommend!,1
"A heart throbbing, tear jerking story. Very immersive and compells the player to make choices that will refect your true character.",1
Best GamePlay :o lol just buy it and download it !,1
"Besides San Andreas, this is probably the best PS2 game out there! Fantastic storyline with awesome characters and excellent voice acting. Even though this is one of the worst PC ports I've ever played, it is still worth the money. It has it's flaws, like the pretty f*cked up controls and the texture issues, not to mention the god awfull camera angles... But even with these problems, I can't stop playing! The story is that good! It's also a very unique game with the whole graffiti element. This game also has the best soundtrack ever! It fit's so well to the theme and really get's you pumped during fights! You will be fustrated a couple of times while playing, but I will still recomend it. Another thing is the cutscenes. THEY ARE GODS WORK! They are SO beautifully executed, ESPECIALLY the movie ones. All in all a fantastic game, go buy it while it's on sale!   My verdict: Solid 8/10  THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE REMASTERED - IF POSSIBLE BY ROCKSTAR GAMES!",1
"cool beans, GREAT GAME",1
"10/10, but if your bad at RPGS or give up easily not for you",1
"This game is just amazing. It has a lot of items in it, and the good thing is, the game is in BETA, so its only getting better. If you do not own this game yet, buy it, you will not regret it!!!",1
"LOVE THIS GAME! This game has quickly become a favorite and I feel it is a great value price wise especially compared to other song based games! Player created beats, a wide variety of songs, and the ability to create your own beatmaps means you will be entertained as long as you can stand and punch the music! We have tried other song based games and this one is our favorite. This game will make you sweat and you will feel it the next day! I found you sweat harder when you create your own beatmap because of the way you have to punch in order to get the beat bubble to show up....i.e. no cheating or your beatmap will look lazy and boring! So if you are looking for a full body sweat, make your own beatmaps!   A couple of suggestions:   - the first time you use the search feature it works great, every time after that, the box is hidden behind the songs so you can't see what you are typing - if there could be a tutorial on how to create a beatmap, I think that would be very helpful. When I did my first one, at the end I didn't have a single beat bubble. Because it was my first one and the robots were mimicking my punch, I didn't realize anything was wrong...it took me a few tries to figure out that I had to punch through the red and yellow lines at the end of the gloves and to make sure I didn't step out of the circle or even close to the edge it seems. I have also noticed that you really have to recoil and extend your arm fully for the best chance of the 'beat bubble' showing up. I found I sometimes have a tendency to do more of a wrist flicking motion and none of those ever count.   Overall a great game that leaves you feeling like you danced for hours at a club that plays only your favorite music!",1
got it for free and 10 seconds before the sale ended also shot a guy in the balls and the he fell on a landmine 11/10,1
its a very good game and you learn a ton of new people.,1
"Addictive, replayability and hard. Demonically. Hard. Yet again what do you expect from the creators of Super Meat Boy? Soundtrack is pretty alright also.",1
"I have played Diabo (1-3), Torchlight 1-2, Titan Quest, and few more others, and so far, Van Helsing is on the top. The world is set in dark sci-fi fantasy + steampunk world. The Loot is great, colorful and many to choose from so it can be adapt to your build. The map is premade and first time round, very engaging story. Here are Pro &amp; Con's: Pro - easy navigation - fast, and candy eye action - many build to try - talent is permanent, hence replaybility to find your perfect Van Helsing - combination of APRG with bit of action Tower Defense - Nice story - and best of all Lady Katarina and her sacarsm Cons - Loading time - maybe its bug - 20GB download - are you serious?? - It gets bit easy... but still enjoyable smashing through enemy Sound - 8 Graphic - 8.5 Gameplay - 9 Replayability - 7 Control - 8 Value - 9 Overall - 8.5 higly recommended and I am looking forward for sequel",1
Very funny/entertaining!!! I recommend this game!!! 9/10,1

♥♥♥♥ is cool as ♥♥♥♥,1
"After one day of exciting gaming, it becomes tedious and at the end of the second day, there are so few things to do at this very very slowzzz..., that I have decided to leave the game. My “premium try out” ran out. That’s when I found out what a big advantage paying players has when they are asleep/at work/school; Auto trading, Auto scouting for important goods, Auto attacking, Auto recruiting and Vacation mode up to 15 days where no one can attack you. Mind you all disadvantages for free-players. Besides the premium, one can buy cards. To get cards one has to buy crowns. Crowns comes in packages from 3,56 euros to 114,99 euros and gives various big advantages in the gameplay. Besides these disadvantages as a free player, one can only work on one quest at a time, some take hours and even days. For instance as a new player, your scouts horse is so slow that you think it is dead, which makes it impossible to get to any of the hidden stashes before other players with speedy horses gets them. Another thing; In some EU countries it is illegal to get people use the feature “send email to a friend” to obtain certain goods. In my first two days I have encountered 2 highly important quests like that. I am really disappointed about this form of illegal activity in a free Steam game! But of course, both times I have sent mail to fictive persons! Now I just need to delete my account, for I am sure that is easy and possible (again according to law).  I would like to buy a similar game, but when bought, one can’t pay to win. Does a game like that exist?",-1
"The last thing I need is a game that requires I install what is essentially a rootkit in order to play it. Thanks for the memories, Planetside 2. Daybreak Games, you can take a long walk off a short pier.",-1
the game is so cool i cant wait,1
"Despite some very glaring graphical glitches and performance issues, I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves turn based strategy games, and even those who normally don't, because the core gameplay loops and moment to moment gameplay in X-COM2 is sublime, this is really as good as this genre gets. Honestly, this is such an engrossing, well designed, and dangerously addictive game that I'm seriously worried about how I'm going to get anything done for the next few weeks, Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that the game designers at Firaxis have really outdone themselves here and created one hell of a time consuming monster.",1
Dont wait the hype is real...,1
Awesome game guys if anything this is better than minecraft...really i love the fun an creative aspect the game pervides for you.i give this game a full complete thumbs up.,1
"So a good piece of the game, and wasted by technical problems and poor optimization. Mainly problems with the multiplayer. The unfortunate thing for the fan of first Company of Heroes - 2,5/5",-1
"How are people giving this game good reviews??  What gets Me annoyed is the countless bugs. I'm writing this review in a crap mood, so take this information with a pinch of salt. For a finished game, its boll0cks, when you load the game from a save (if it loads at all), I can't open the map or many other things. There are other bugs I've had, though in My crap mood I can't recall them.  The fact of the matter is, when all is said and done, yes its cheap, but that isnt an excuse to be a bug ridden mess. Fix the bugs and this would be a decent little time killer of a game, but its been out for ages and its left up to players to do it. Who wants to support a dev that lets is players fix stuff, while knocking out a sequel. Meh!",-1
this game sucks i hate my friend for telling me to buy it,-1
This game is amazingly good,1
This game is more of an interasctive story in all fairness. Thats not a bad thing though. You are placed in an empty house and you have to discover what has happened whilst you was gone by being curious and looking at everything. If you play games to be challenged then you might not like this but if you play to experience a good story then you have to give this a try. What i especially liked was the atmoshere and how it transports you back to the 90s. I really hope there will be more games like this in the future.,1
Good job remaking the original counter-strike. Zombie mode is fun but takes Forever to complete a level. But still good none the less.,1
"ah fallout, the best post apocalyptic game on the planet :)",1
The pretty princess dress-up video game/rpg.  So glorious.,1
"This is probably one of the most interesting and unique games I have played in a long time. The gameplay is great and rather intuitive. The sound track is very nice as well, it suits the atmosphere of the game perfectly. The game is fun and it just kind of sucks you into the game. The visuals of the game are phenomenal. Everything looks so clean and pristine. Overall this game is a joy to play and a breath of fresh air compared to some of the other games out there right now.",1
Better than Metro 2033.,1
"Real fun game to get into, nice way to kill some time.",1
"Costume Quest is a good game. It is a short, but sweet RPG with easy to understand battle mechanics and a heart-warming story.",1
"Excellent! Mature themes, great noir asthetic, story has me hooked!",1
Still hunting for my cake :/,1
Game is fun until you get to the racing missions at which point its impossible to move past. In the mission the cars handling is so unrealistic that it makes to game not fun at all.,-1

"Introducing: Hold 'w' and Pretend To Be Immersed in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft Wanna-Be World: The (not) Game!  I tried really hard to enjoy this game the way it advertised itself as. I really did, I put in effort to try and be immersed. You walk around in this dumb retro-graphics island and they throw in a bunch of dumb little things like seeing a squirrel run up a tree and throw some xylophone notes to go along with it to make it seem like it's ♥♥♥♥in magic or something. Everything I encountered that was supposed to be cool just wasn't, the game failed in almost every regard and I was just bored for a half hour.   I am actually kind of livid with myself for even buying this peice of indie trash. This is the epitome of 'artsy' indie garbage. Maybe you'll enjoy it if you're TOKED UP STONED AND BLAZED 420 or whatever, i dont ♥♥♥♥in know  Maybe if they wanted some cool immersive casual world where you just explore they could scrap the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'old school' graphics gimmick and actually make it visually appealing, and actually have experiences in the game be cool and have meaning. ♥♥♥♥. Indie garbage ♥♥♥♥ poop balls ♥♥♥ (non) game.   Just ♥♥♥♥in play minecraft on peaceful mode and never actually pick up blocks or do anything ever and just walk around in your generated world, and you get the jist of this game. Wow!  dont spend money on this",-1
"Well, I just got friendzonzed... brb killing myself over a computer a.i that has damaged my soul",1
Boring as hell,-1
Masterpiece. And btw this is the case when trailer actually describes the game quite vividly and truly.,1
"One of the most interesting games in recent years. Deus Ex: HR thrusts you into an immersive, highly detailed and interactive, deeply conflicted, and plausible future world that asks many questions about where technology will lead us, but doesn't give clear cut answers.   Not only is it thought provoking, but the blend of stealth action and role-playing is second to none. Choices matter and you'll often find yourself in really intense scenarios, for which the outcome is ultimately decided by the player.  This game thankfully avoids many game design pitfalls, and really shines because of it. The plot is elievable the whole way and doesn't push your suspension of disbelief too much, which is rare for games... and movies and TV shows too. The character development is noteworthy, the story is quite easy to relate to I find.   The stealth gameplay is a bit more rewarding and enjoyable than combat, but the player can choose either one or both whenever they feel like it. It has much bigger, more content heavy hubs than the original, and overall far more detailed level design. It has a bit less 'choice and consequence' than the original though, along with a more serious and mature tonality.",1
Playing even the first few moments of this dynamic RPG fills you with determination.,1
This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing peice of ♥♥♥♥. Filled with idiot russians and ♥♥♥♥ing cheaters. I was minding my own bussnies in the mid lane and suddenly a ♥♥♥♥ing cheater came out teleporting and killing us all in one second.  ♥♥♥♥ off valve this is the worst game ever 0/10 you stupid ♥♥♥♥ing idiots.,-1
Huge replay value... must buy for any pc gamer,1
"Wow, just wow. I went into this game with pretty high expectation but I was still blown away. This game is solid, it's hard as hell, but incredibly well made. The beauty in this game is that every time you die ( and you will die, A LOT) it doesn't feel cheap or un-avoidable, it always feels like your fault. No matter how frustrated I got I never felt like putting the game down and quitting. This is a must have for fans of 8 &amp; 16-bit platformers, or just for fans of the Nerd.",1
"A few points for context. I have a Chemical Engineering training background. I do lots of programming in my job. And I really love puzzle oriented games. In other words, this game should be a perfect fit for me.  For the most part, this game is amazing. They took a very simple premise, and made a puzzle game that can get really complex. Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.  Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough. I understand that this is just a game, and not an IDE, but it is a programming game... or perhaps, I am just being too critical.   In summary, I do recommend this game, but it is not perfect.",1
"Why this game sucks: 1. A completely ludicrous fictional Rome 2. Extremely repetitive combat  3. Terrible upgradeable skills 4. Incredibly unimmersive battles, your fellow legionaries are completely useless. 5. A very bland and often times confusing story that has pacing issues.  6. Multiplayer is complete trash, when it could have been great. Why the ♥♥♥♥ no pvp?!? FFS im supposed to be a gladiator 7. The depiction of the colesieum arena is just awful... ancient romans can produce enviroments... spawn trees... just.. just why..   2/10 made the mistake of finishing the campaign so now I cant get my ♥♥♥♥ing 8 dollars back. (tells you how much this game sucked.)",-1
The one true CS.,1
"If you dont mind dumb &amp; unreasonable AI on single player. If you dont mind long turns &amp; managing many things on your own.  Just buy it then. Last Civ I played was 5, long time ago with all DLCs it was fun. I checked only single player content for that it was great. Coming up Civ 6 is price'y but... it simply gives alot in that package. Many fractions, many things to test, I have 18 hours and I didn't finish any game from start to end, because I am still learning things. How to be efficient in that game. I play on King difficulty, I play multi with a friend and we simply have fun. Game is well explained and probably the most friendly 4X series on Steam. I wouldn't recommend it for only singleplayer purpose... it is rather boring comparing to civ 5 scenarios.  Soo anyway I paid a good money for Civ 6. I am happy from what I've got. Day and night system is gorgeous along with graphics and music. City districts are fun and give our country a nice individual look. This game feels diffrent with each fraction as a result it is fun for at least 100 hours. But only if you have time for at least 2 hour sessions. Loading screens are long.",1
"Fun game needs a few tweeks still, but over all lots of fun until you run into a dragon then it can be not so fun but still fun if ya get my meaning.",1
"Love this game, nice mix of strategy and FPS action. Haven't encountered any game crashing issues in six hours of played time and this game has found it's way to the top of my rotation.",1
great game gives u every thing in the game free just by it and so fun hope u have fun,-1
top,1
Really fun with many hours of content that is only enhanced by the mods being made for the game!,1

best moba type game ever played,1
really hard to move ,-1
I had sex 218 times in one minute. She must own some quality lube. 68/70,1
"Its ok. The dialogue and the style is good, though it doesnt make up for its easy gameplay and simple puzzles. If its not meant to be hard, thats fine, but labeling it a puzzle platformer is a stretch. There wasn't a moment in the game where I said 'hold on a sec', or had to stop to figure something out. Its straightforward, and you can beat it in 3 hours easy if you take your time. That said, its a decent game that delivers a good story with witty commentary and a good style. Get if its on sale, I wouldn't pay full price.  TLDR: [ ] (thats a rectangle)",1
"This game is not for everyone, but it is definitely for me! If you use fast travel when you play games like Skyrim, Fallout, etc. you'll probably HATE this game. But if you like walking around and exploring you'll love the game.   The gameplay centers around survival, crafting, exploration--action and combat, much less. It's also VERY unstructured. You need to set your own goals, such as getting a better ship, improving your exosuit, etc. The game actually reminds me of X3: Reunion but with a much better realized universe. That game had a weak story, high learning curve, and left many people at a loss as to WHAT to do in the game. No Man's Sky is much the same. It's a sandbox. For me, figuring out what I can do (such as finding ways to survive without energy for my hazard shields) is the fun of the game...  The game certainly is not perfect. I'm lucky in that in runs pretty well on my computer, but it might be smart for other to wait until the next patch comes out to try your luck. If Hello Games can polish the game and follow through on it's promise of free addons like base buiding etc. and if they open the game up for community mods, this could be a truly great game. As it is, I give it 8/10.  UPDATE:  Since the patch on 8/18 the game runs GREAT for me--60 fps on med/high settings on my mid-grade laptop!  Oh, and I'm 60 hrs in (or more) and I'm still having a lot of fun. The game changes a bit once you gain access to better ships and equipment. Now, I'm hunting pirates and exploring much more difficult/dangerous planets...",1
"great game, only con is Uplay sucks",1
"This game sucks dirty, wet, slimy, dog balls. I do not reccomend. After playing it a short while I felt my brains cells commiting suicide one by one. The creators of this game should be shot on sight.",-1
easily the best indie game i've ever played,1
"Pretty neat hidden object game. Even though the plot seemed like a cliche serial killer song it made me curious about the murderer. Why is he doing this? What was driving him mad? Should I join him?  Nice art and atmosphere, lovable killer and brilliant bonus art.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=779523567 ",1
"I am a fly.. how neat!  Personally not a bug person but I don't hate bug either. So I played this game for 5 minutes.(1 run though).  Your path is going up in this game. As you leave the ground your fly become smaller and smaller. Avoid things lika spider web. But even if you are caught you can try to break free. There are also wind, falling leaf and many different objects that made this feels pretty real.  For a Free game it's quite worth it for quick 100% achievement. IT's got neat graphics with amazing sound effects. The music that was playing when you flys really high is quite dramatic.  I would recommend developer to try to make a VR game out of this. It will be cool.  7/10 for a free neat little fly game and easy 100%.",1
"Undertale is a great game and I absolutely recommend it. The game deals with morality in games in a new way. Without spoiling too much, this game is very different from traditional RPGs in that for every encounter in the game, you can resolve the fight peacefully or violently. Which resolution you pick changes your experience greatly.  In terms of gameplay, Undertale uses a simplified of traditional RPG combat. Instead of learning new moves to attack with, you find new armor and weapons to boost your ATK or DEF. When an enemy attacks you, you have the chance to avoid damage not by RNG but by a bullet hell-esque situation where you literally must dodge the attacks.  This game is much better when played without prior knowledge so instead of continuing to write a review, I'll just recommend that you play it. It really is a great game and is definitely worth playing.",1
"sup, awesome game. cool guy yeah dude? kthx",1
its like skyrim with phallic weaponry,1
Game is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they blow all this money on next gen ♥♥♥♥ and you cannot use the xbox controler for online play you have to swing the keyboard like a sword because devs too stupid to include game pads in online play. Feel free to play with the keyboard and feel like a troglodyte. Buy this for console. 10/10 would swing sword keyboard again,-1
This game must be played twice to see both sides of the story. And you will enjoy every moment of it. The LAN hacking is a great addition to an already excellent game.,1
"I don't get this game, I guess. So if there is much more to it. Please do not consider my rating.  On the one hand the idea to have some kind of text RPG adventure sounds interesting. But on the other hand this was just plain boring. I clicked myself through the text within 10 minutes and it was finished.  I mean the game does not even have Steam achievements.  I bought the game in a Humble Bundle for like nothing. But this game costs 10 EUR on Steam. Sorry, this is too much. But maybe I am just missing something and I am completely mistaken.  I can not recommend it.",-1
"Yeah, what can I say. Greatest game ever made if you put in the time to learn it at the higher levels. This is definitely the deepest game out there. Pro's have to consistently hit timings down to 16 ms, in addition to reading the opponent, adjusting to their character, and developing their own strategies to psyche them out. In reality this is psychological fighter IV, and if you like deep games, you can forget about any of the other ones out there.   USF4 takes the cake.",1
"Fun little bullet hell game. Felt a little long at times, but refreshingly different from other games. Just the right length.",1
world's largest swat force,1
"I had to edit the .ini file to stop the game locking up in Win 7 (Thanks steam forum), game works like a charm now.",1
"All around this game is fantastic. Good port, looks great, runs like dream and so on.. they even have the guy who is acting Jack Bauer! Only bad side about the game is that you can't use your mouse in the menus. Specs real quick: gtx 760, i5-4460, 8gb, win8.1",1
"DO NOT BUY, WHATEVER YOU DO!  Due to the Games for Windows Live shutdown, it has become impossible to get past the title screen of the game, and customer support is absolutely useless.",-1
"Nice puzzle-elements with interesting twists and turns.  You have to be good at jum'n'runs, or butterflies will tickle your tummy.",1
It's FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,1
Its a awesome game 10 out of 10. But theres a problem it crashes alot and you will lose your saves.,1
it's ok if ur bad at the game there's boob at least 3 boob just for u.,1
Bought this game to play custom zombies and it has lived up to the amazingness of zombies.,1
You can make CS:STAY and half life 3 and Portal GO pretty good...,1
Best of GTA 10/10,1
"This is surprising for an old game. You can't really see it, but behind the low-quality, wet-origami animated mutant game its still good to play.",1
Got so many mods I hardly recognize the game anymore.,1
"IMHO one of the best alternatives for WoW. In fact LoTRO takes a lot from WoW but only good solutions. A huge (I mean really HUGE) and constamtly enhancing world of Middle-Earth with this specific Tolkien Atmosphere is something amazing for Lord of The Rings books and movies fans. Game includes main storyline, different for each race, thousands additional quests, a lot of instances, skirmishes and complex crafting system.",1
It`s warm and cosy game. You just watch the fire and feel peace. Have fun!,1
This game is amazing. That is all.,1
Absolutely love this game! Spend way too much time playing it.,1
"This games fun. The core game is quite easy but the challenges are hard. It's not easy getting 100%, which adds a fair bit of replay value.",1
"I, like many others, bought this game for the DayZ mod when it was in it's infancy. Was very happy with DayZ and enjoyed it quite a bit. I really enjoyed the controls that ARMA offered us compared to other games.",1
This game is very nice from all of its amazing cars to its amazing maps. Very much detail was put into this game. So far I think it is worth every penny!,1
The “Best use of a potato” Award,1
"♥♥♥♥ing amazing. A real experience, i have a talking cat, a tall ♥♥♥ skeleton wearing a top hat for an imaginary friend, i become a tree, and its all thanks to the crazy children at the mental hospital you start out the game in! :D  Also i call upon the assistance of the mother of all evil! 'A Real Experience.'",1
the game is weird.,1
"Liked it very much!!! if you are a fan of either open-world games or zombie games - you should definetely check it out! don't beleive the negative reviews, the game is really REALLY captivating with some ery fancy RPG mechanics",1
"Got in with the free trial. I'm amazed people pay for this crap.  Original black ops was much better.  My 10 min experience :  Spawn system sucks - you spawn sandwitched between two enemies Grind to win - need to grind to have usable guns, you die before you can ads otherwise.  Looking at how people play, it became a game of running forward, aim in the general direction of the enemy and use the weapon with the fastest rate of fire available.  I'm sure the killstreak and specialisation are amazing. Core game sucks.",-1
Decided to buy new gun that looked cool  sold all my great weapons for it  exit shop and look at it  turns out it's exactly the same as another gun I have  go to sell it and buy my weapons back  Sell gun  Weapons not in buy back  weapons not in buy  exit shop again  decide to buy shotgun back  not in buy or buy back  now I have no weapons and no money  10/10 would get scammed by AI again,1
This is A Great Game It was good before 1.0 but i feel that the game has truly been completed it's more balenced than its ever been. although the loss of content is unfortunate the easy modability and mulitiplay make up for it in the best of ways The exploreation is intuitive the crafting is unique and the weapons are cool the only downside [ for me ] is the fact that the final boss mission is impossible to understand without looking it up.,1
"Tried this game out when it was free for 2 days, found it confusing and hard Googled alot and watched a tutorial vid, because i'm dumb probably :p  Anyway once you get the basics down, you simple cannot turn this game off ... I'v had this game for a week now and played more than 50 hours which is crazy for me :)  Endless replayabilty, even if you are halfway trough the game and are bored with the character you are playing with, you can load the save game and just play as ANYONE else, which is awesome if you feel like doing that...  Just great game filled with plotting, conquering and being smart and sneeky, or mean and ruthless, or kind and passive However you want to play the game!",1

"Able to test your problem solving to it's limits without ever getting frustrating, this is a very weird, but ultimately very rewarding little puzzle game.",1
Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   5 Hours Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 non stop. This game have 'just one more game' effect. Even more than MW3 or BO2.,1
awesome game thats lots of fun with freinds,1
Love This Game!,1
Amazing. If you love RPG's you will have no regrets.,1
"Well, I've only got about 2 hours played, but should you get this game? Hell yeah. At any price.   If you have the slightest love for platformers, this is the game to get. I am not sure if I can put this game to justice just yet, but given the high quality of the gameplay you cannot help but being drawn into it. The combat is amazing, and the background music really enhances the feeling of being a hero just fighting a little bit further. The voice acting is suprisingly good, and even though the dialouges can be experinced as a slow down, you can skip right through them if you want to. Oh, and the landscapes are very well made, and are just beautiful.  Over all this game is a must. Get it. Stop reading. JUST GET IT!  ",1
♥♥♥♥,1
"This is a great game, enjoyed it very much. Its a very simple and exciting game and I wish it was just longer! One of my favorite parts is the narration and its almost like your in a book and he is telling the story. Great game and would recommend to anyone. Looking forward to other games from them!",1
It's almost a perfect war simulation.,1
This game really amazing and everything about it is awesome but you need to be a experianced player and im really good at RTS but with this game i spent 4 hours on one mission and failed twice so im just saying you need to be expert with this kinda game,-1
"One of my favorite Call of Duty games along with Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty World at War. These call of duty games in my opinion are the best even compared to the modern entries into the franchise, you cant go wrong with a 'classic'.",1
Will not kill anything again 10/5   *Secret* Sans killed me 70000000+ times will sans again 1/snas,1
glitchiest game ever. ,1
Great throwback game. The battlefields are massive. For my personal preference id enjoy the game more with less vehicles  And much more emphasis on PVP FPS style.,1
Some tips for playing this game: 1.Play Iron Man mode. 2.Get your veteran team through 30+ missions. 3.Get them the best equipment. 4.Watch them kill each other in the near end missions. 5.Uninstall the game.,-1
Am I the only one with a boner during the torture sences?,1
"Although the game is pretty old by now, it's still a must play. The story telling is great and the game plays very good. The soundtrack is also really good and you really feel like you're in a large universe. Must play!",1
"Pros: Good experience, loads of options on planes and tanks.  Cons: Rammers. Teamkillers. If those people who intentionally ram aircraft could be properly dealt with, it'd be all the stars.",1
"I can't play this game, I actually can't play this game. Not because it's to hard but because my computer won't let me. I tried looking for ways to fix this but I can't. So I demand a refund. Untill this is fixed for windows 7-8 I can't recommend this game. I'm sorry.",-1
"All I have to say is....Why ? Whyyyyyy T^T !!!  Why do I have to collect trineangles to go to the next level ?  Why are there no skills ? Why the awkward controls with depth of field ? I always end up not knowing what the character is doing and where he's gonna land. Will it be the platform, will it be the lava ?! Gee I don't know the suspense is killing me, litteraly.   I loved Trine 1 &amp; 2, I would have liked to love Trine 3 as well, it's beautiful, but it's full of little things that just make it too frustrating to play.  And the fact that I don't have any ice arrows anymore...I'm sorry :( but this I would just not recommend Trine 3, I'm even thankful I bought it on sale for just 5/6 euros.",-1
"Dark Souls 3 Is by far one of the best looking souls game out of the three.   Gameplay is so beyond unchallenging compared to the other two it's almost laughable.   Currently, pvp is just a lag fest. You get people who glide all over and hit you with no animation, Also when you invade you will get cross mapped by hosts making it super unfair and not even fun let alone challenging. Now don't get me wrong you do find some games where the PvP is actually enjoyable (mainly when you can hit them and actually be on equal footing) it makes you keep playing but you run into the lag fest more times than not.   I would give this game a 6/10 just mainly for the PvE content but outside of that the game is pretty lack luster. Not hard even on NG+++ Will keep playing for the achievements and hopefully they fix the lag and the DLC will pack more a punch to show me they haven't gone soft this is my take on it.",1
"Nice game, worth the current discount for sure",1
"Amazing game, makes you want to keep coming back for more",1
"So I'm a huge fan of wipeout and found this game out of the blue. After reading some reviews I bought it and have taken it for a spin.   I love it! As great as wipeout if not better. Great graphics, cool soundtrack, fast action.   Someone mentioned on a review that they didn't recommend using a steam controller with this and opted for an Xbox controller. Totally disagree. After trying both, the Xbox controller blows. Steam controller with a preset and some tweaking for personal preferences is amazing.   Some other reviews also mentioned the AI, specifically 'rubber banding'. And I agree, the AI sucks generally. One thing this game could do a lot better on. Players want to feel a sense of progression on the track and the strange choices the devs made basically rob you of this. So hopefully someone fixes that soon. If you're struggling devs, pop Wipeout back into a PS and take it for a spin.   Knowing the AI deficiency going in, I mainly race for myself at this stage and I don't regret the purchase.   If you're sitting on the fence, don't. Pick this sucker up and start racing.",1
ONE OF THE BEST FREE GAMES ON STEAM!  10/10 Will continue to play for a long time.,1
"Let's start of with saying, that I work in a hospital. Love taking care of all the people that are sick/dying and trying to fight off whatever illness/disease process they have.  This game is actually pretty exciting since I have to do the opposite of what I do everyday! SIck, I know! But look at it at a medical person's point of view: we have to know what disease it is and how it works to defeat it, but in this game, you have to make it BETTER!  This game is pretty helpful in real life because it makes me better at what I do ;-)  Suggestions: Do mini games where you have to go inside a person's body and, for example, if I'm a virus I get a chance to try and infect other healthy cells, but I also have to try and hijack and destroy the T-cells that defend the body, etc.   If I'm a parasyte (see the cool way I spelled it? Haha), give me a chance to try and infect the host whilst trying to avoid being destroyed myself.  If I'm a tumor, give me a chance to try and hijack the replication process of the cells to make it cancerous. I believe there are G-0 to G-3 gates during replication, but I'm not too sure right now as I write this.",1
"I thought this game had a ton of potential, but found it to be not what I was expecting.  Somewhat similar to Deus Ex:HR but a bit older. Another game I did not fully enjoy. Not saying it isn't a good game, as it is; but I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped to.",-1
"If you like RPGs, give D:OS a couple hours and you won't be disappointed.",1
"Here is Terraria, one of my favorite games. Let me explain to you why I prefer Terraria to any player. First off, lets talk about the graphics  The graphics are actually pretty cool and unique. I mean, how much games to do you see with a art style like Terraria. I find that there is really no flaw with the graphics.   Time to get into the meat of this game, the core gameplay.   I honestly love this game so much more for the amazing gameplay. There are so much bosses to defeat and stuff to get. This game has to have one of the most biggest selection of weapons and stuff to choose and its quite balanced also. The building is great and they have a bunch of furniture so you can really make a good house. The biomes make this game unique, as it has a dark biome every time you generate a world. You either get Crimson (a reddish enviroment with spiders and other mobs) or you get the corruption (a purple biome that has flying units named Eater of Souls). These really make the game how it is, as without it the game would be plain and boring. Once you get into the underworld and defeat the WoF, this unlocks a huge chunk of the game. Literally, its a game changer adding a new biome called the Hallow (basically, the good side just with killer unicorns) and Underground Crimson along with Underground Corruption (stronger units underground).  Lets talk about the soundtrack.  Oh man, oh man do I love the soundtrack (favorite song from soundtrack is Ocean). The boss battles and biomes wouldn't be good without the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazing, beautiful and especially unique as it just fits with the biomes and the art style.  I really dont know what else to say about it, overall its just a wonderful, unique and just flatout amazing. You get the point, just go buy the game now. I promise, you will not regret it. By the way, to you nubs out there, I really recommend you always have the wiki on your side because its really a life saver, even for some experienced players. Also, I had alot more hours then this, I just lost my other account and lost my hours. Anyways, thank you for reading my wonderful review!",1
"very intricate combat for advanced combos, but very spammy if newer. the characters seem slightly unbalanced, but very patchable. it is the only game i have seen accuratley do sword play, and very unique gameplay.",1
Great fun and intense. Worth every penny.,1
"The Hunter is the best hunting game there is. No questions, it looks great, it plays smooth and is realistic!  It does not have a long and hard learing cruve, you have a 'Hunter mate' that can tell you what tracks it is that you just found and tell you where the track is leading. For me it took like 3 - 4 hours to really get the hang of the game.   Now, as a 'free' user you only get to hunt (i think its 2 not sure) 2 animals and you get 2 weapons. You get one hunting reserve that is huge. If you want to play the other 7 reserves and hunt all the 18 animals you need a subscribtion. When i started playing this game i first played as a free user and hunted for 1 hour per day just to see if i enjoyed it that much that i would like to pay for it.   And i did! So i bought the 300kr (29 euros approx) package that gave me 6 months sub, a ♥♥♥♥ tons of weapons and equpiment. When my sub was gone, i still had all my weapons and equimpent left, so i just bought another 3 months for 80kr (8-9 euros) and started to play again.   There is a lot of stuff you can buy ingame, for example callers, baits and camo. I have used the regular outfit for more than a year and been able to hunt in every reserve and any animal with out problem. Its just for looks and making hunting a little bit easier (even though i think its funnier to just follow tracks and shoot them, some perfeer to sit near an open field with a caller and wait for somthing to show up).   Anyway should you get this game? Install it and try as a free user. If you liked it, I recommend the 30 euro package, it gives you (in my opinion) the best rifle and some equipment.  ",1
"Title says it all, yet another boring, repetitive zombie defense game. Can't wait for the sequel 'Enough With The ♥♥♥♥ing Zombies Already'",-1

"Im not a fan of RPGs , but after finishing Act 1 , I definitely will give this game thumbs up. Since im not a fan of RPGs , but I played a lot of Torchlight I &amp; II back in 2010/2011. I have to say Im impressed , Grinding Gear Games  Here are some Pros and Cons  Pros: -You can be litteraly everything  Cons: -I get lost in Prison (Lower and Upper) -Hard Bosses (Rage Quit after being killed from Merveil for the 500th time)  Should I recommend this game? If you played Torchlight, Diablo and other RPGs then click on Play Game  I give it 9/10  ",1
"Really good. Not the bestly optimized, but if you can run it it's fantastic. Really really fun to run around and kill zombies.",1
this my friends is how all free indie games should be like ,1
Beautiful game! I got it for $1 on Games Radar and Greenman Gaming.,1
This is my all time favourite game and I could play it 24/7 if I could..W0oT!,1
Im in love with this game its by far one of my most played games. the only problem is the dlc is out of controle.,1
"Gonna go over the pros and cons Pros: 1. nice map layout 2. Lots of gamemodes to keep you entertained 3. creative mechanics make it unique 4. Very cheap 5. Only 200 megabytes Cons: 1. Its hard to kill people 2. quite laggy unless you turn down res 3. weapon cooldown is a pain 4. Takes a tad longer than I'd like to respond to controls  Knowing what I do now, would I buy this game? Yes.",1
so much trouble shooting ,1
"This game was gifted to me by a friend, and now I love the man. 100/10 would play again.",1
"It's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.  Great game, took less than an hour and a half to beat. The asking price is $30 CAD. For the time spent this is riddiculous.",1
"If you enjoy huge maps with multiple battles an objectives happening at once, like me, then definately give this game a go. Not so many people play anymore making it a bit dead, but if you find that there are plenty then by all means invest a good amount of time into it",1
"A good game, but not without flaws. The music, world, and plot are all top-notch. The only problem is the game itself is well, a bit of a chore. The combat, frankly, is quite awful, as it lacks both the tactical appeal of a top-up party based western RPG like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age and the fluid action gameplay of a proper action-RPG like Skyrim. You just click repeatedly and hope you hit. Like all Elder Scrolls games, you level up what you use, but the way Morrowind does it can lead to some mildly ridiculous metagaming. (eg: Oh dear, I'd better avoid jumping for the rest of the level or my Acrobatics stat will get ahead of my Short Blades stat.) I would prefer Morrowind's multiple attributes such as strength, speed, intelligence, and willpower to Skyrim's three, health, stanima, and magica, if the sole purpose in every stat in Morrowind was not to raise your health, stanima, or magica, or to raise damage/resistance, which Skyrim did via skills and perks. For example, your character's dialogue isn't any different if he's got an Intelligence of 60 or 30, so why bother keeping count? In Dragon Age, you got unique dialoge options based on your cunning stat, and low intelligence characters in Neverwinter Nights talked reel dum liek thiz. If the only purpose of Intelligence is to get more magica, then honestly, they were streamlining, not dumbing down when they got rid of it in favor of the Magica stat directly. While exploration is much touted, enemies aren't leveled, and as such, may be ridiculously easy or hard depending on the area. This is, of course, more realistic than enemies always being just tough enough for you, and wouldn't be a problem if leveling didn't feel like such a damned grind. To be brutally honest, there are times it feels like a MMO in a vacant world. Other things touted as 'perks' by Morrowind afficianados may be tinted a bit by nostalgia as well, I suspect. For example, some people decry that gauntlets come as sets in Oblivion and Skyrim, but to be honest, it feels a bit stupid when a store has three left steel gauntlets and no right ones for sale. Does it cater to one armed men or something? I won't criticize the game based on technological inferiority to more modern games because doing so would be grossly unfair and with all Elder Scrolls games, it's fun enough to ♥♥♥♥ around in. However, in all honesty, I reccomend the game more for the fact that it's required to run the upcoming Skywind mod for Skyrim which modernizes the graphics and gameplay while maintaining Morrowind's unique aesthetic and story than the game in its own right. Morrowind is a dated masterpiece, a labor of love to be sure, but if anyone tries to tell you that it is a perfect game, and that more modern games are for stupid illiterate mouth-breathing console peasants, you should gently inform them that it is that sort of attitude that makes Lord Vivec cry.",1
Good Graphic Many tracks to drive  Good rock-guitar musics ,1

"Uninstalled, ♥♥♥♥ ATT",-1
"I bought this game when it was on sale, played it for 8.5 hours then uninstalled it because I had 100% the game. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I'm saying I didn't want to close the ♥♥♥♥er till I knew what was going on with this game. Also ♥♥♥♥ the golden bull.",1
Very fun game to play I am still actively playing it and am enjoying the content. There is also a free multiplayer expansion coming out for the game for current owners or for people who have yet to buy it will increase the price so I would buy it now. It has a large replay value as it challenges you to survive again and again and beat your record as well as play with no characters. For the novice gamer it is a bit hard to survive as there are no in game tutorials and you kind've have to figure everything out yourself. I died myself the first time on the 4th day when a giant squid tentacle shot out of the swamp I was exploring and one-shot me. 10/10 Anyway I highly reccomend the game and recomend you get it soon. ,1
Most terrifying free horror game out there,1
"Boy If any game embodies the term 'mixed bag' it's Lisa, the story is extremely gripping the combat is like a faster paced version of 'Earthbound' and the dark humor is generally quite funny, not to mention the AGONIZING choices you have to make at several points in the game...but then there's the bad stuff such as several important plot threads not being resolved and the fact that the game is just long enough to overstay it's welcome somewhat (I was getting a bit tired of the game near the end) though with all that said it's still a well written little tale of depression, inadequacy, regret, betrayal and if you play your cards right...forgiveness.",1
This game is a keeper for strategy games lover. Must try and highly recommended. My rating 10/10...nuff said.,1
Awesome game rember the first time i played it!,1
"A short VN that has a lot of charm to it. Don't expect to get much more than 15-20 minutes out of it, but the writing is witty and reflect well on the tribulations of art students everywhere. The style of the VN, in terms of art, music, and general presentation, lack significant faults, and the giddy ragtime BGM doesn't persist long enough to overstay its welcome.  It's free, and it's a nice way to spend half an hour. If you're a struggling young adult, this will speak quite a bit to your experiences and you'll definitely get a laugh out of it. It gets surprisingly touching too.",1
"This game will make you rage. It's an addictive, but incredibly hard platformer where instead of jumping you flip gravity at will. Lots of fun, but very hard.",1
great ♥♥♥♥ing game I love it and it is even better when playing with a friend ,1
"  You play Marty, trailer trash extraordinaire, as you race through hell to retrieve your stolen beer from Satan himself. 6/66 would race again.",1
"Played a bit, love the graphics, love the gamely, but could be better optimized... low fps in cities and high monster populated areas even on high - end hardware, recommend to try :)",1
Sucks balls,-1
"Cute. Not exactly taxing, though, or especially substantial.",1
"Beautiful, immersive, incredible gameplay",1
"one of the best games ever made within the single player, story-oriented, gameplay.   easily into the 60hours of gameplay, 100+ if you try to get all achieves and every sidemission/unlockable.",1
"At first it's fun, but then the gameplay becomes quite boring and repetitive.  And it's freakingly hard to micromanage all of your planets at the same time without a pause button.  This game may appeal to a select audience, but it's not my cup of tea.",-1
this is an AWESOME game... but i cant get steam to open,1
Awesome game. Only thing it needed to be 10/10 was hot keys for attack. Can solve that with Auto-Hotkey install ...,1
"i compared my kd with controller vs mechanical keyboard/gaming mouse and the aim assist is just stupid and does not belong in any game. Also, guns are unbalanced.   back to csgo  That said, im running at constant 70+fps",-1
Pretty good game overall except some times the lag is real and becomes the big issue when enemies are invisible and kills u and or makes u just try to hit in every direction ever but w/e deleted the game cuz it got boring cuz lvl cap is too low beat it in 3 days,1
Good Game. Very good adventure game,1
"Way too many loot drops - usually 4-5 items per encounter and you only have an inventory of 20 slots. So you spend too much time sorting through items. Also, combat is stat heavy yet somehow feels too simplistic since each character only has 2 skills, and from what I see there are no skill upgrades or ways to get new skills. And, the skills don't necessarily complement each other very well. To see a rogue-like done right, check out Darkest Dungeon. You have to really pay attention to balancing your team with that game, and each team member plays an important role. Here you can have all warriors, all wizards, all rogues etc. and be just fine as long as you have enough heal potions, which are very plentiful. So long story short, this is not a thinking person's game, it's just kill a group, get new loot, equip new loot, throw most of your lott away since your inventory is so limited, kill another group, make sure you have plenty of potions, rinse and repeat. Gets boring and very grindy FAST. On the plus side, some of the humor and random encounters are pretty funny. Like where you find a dog that leads you to a hole and starts digging, and then just pees in the hole and leaves. Lol!",-1

"FootLoL enticed me with its soccer theme and its madness on the field. Upon playing the game a little bit more, it's definitely not for me. I'm not a casual gamer by any means but do like playing games like this in-between other games. Reason I cannot recommend it is that it gets boring after a while. I may find it boring, you may not. Heck, I'm sure kids would like this game.  An emphasis on strategy should be put here rather than soccer. Although soccer seems to be the main theme of the game, you (as the player) have about zero control over the players on the pitch. The only thing you can control is placing tactical objects or weapons on the pitch. Some of the weapons that are included are land mines (which blow-up opponents when they are near), meteorites where meteors will literally come from the sky and hit the field, a herd of cows can be used to flatten your opponent, ball multipliers to increase the amount of goals you score when the ball goes into the net and not limited to turrets. Counter-measures are also included to help you defend your players from your opponent. Armor can be equipped, bubble spheres can be erected to protect players (or the ball from moving forward), speed boosts or speed traps, protective bubble shields that can block ball and players as well as the ability to expand the opponents net. There are A LOT of weapon options in game which is a great feature.  The players themselves do not make much of an effort to dodge any of the obstacles. Essentially, they have positions but players will move near the ball if it's close by. The game feels pretty balanced. Deciding which weapons to take to the 'battle'field can literally make a night and day difference in the score. Choose the wrong power-ups or use them too much and watch your score stay stagnant. There are a few game modes in FootLoL : championship mode where you tour the world/solar system, quick match and multiplayer mode. Most players will most likely choose to pursue championship mode before anything else. In championship mode you start with a certain amount of slots and certain amount of abilities. As the game progresses (and the better you do in-games), the cash-rewards become a lot bigger. The AI within the game also becomes progressively difficult although most of the time beating him isn't the most difficult. Meeting certain objectives laid out before hand is where the challenge lies. Each match is timed and the team with the most goals when the clock hits zero, wins. The better the performance and the more conditions that are met means a better payout. Don't forget though, your opponent can possess the same abilities as you!   Visually , the game play is cool because there is a lot going. Watching meteors fall from the sky while sheep are running across the field while blobs are blocking certain players can get insane. As I said, visually watching it is cool. Playing it is a completely different story (because this is where the limitations start coming in).  The biggest issue for me is that this feels like a game I would play on the iPad. I understand the 'mobile gaming' platform is slowly evolving and yes programmers should get some credit where credit is due, but I certainly do not like purchasing games that could be played on an iPad (on a rig that costs a lot more than one). As I've said, if you're into strategy and something a little bit different with some outlandish effects, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. If you're here for some soccer or some sort of inclusiveness, it's not here. If they added a gimmick or something in which you could control players, I'm sure that would have added another depth to the game.   Overall, I won't recommend it as it's not my cup of tea. However, if you do like this (even for a full price), I would recommend getting it. I think there was enough put into the game to get enough bang for your buck.

good and nice,1
It's so nice to see classic Star Trek games appearing on Steam! This game plays just as it did when I was a kid and it brings back so many memories. The perfect game for a Star Trek fan.,1
I held off buying this game until recently. I enjoyed playing Rainbow Six:3 and was not sure about trying the series again. Glad I did. I really enjoy this game.,1
"The only game I've ever finished three times. One of my absolute favourites. Awesome art style, great narration, good story, tight controls, good feedback, lots of emotion. Frequently on sale - buy it and play it.",1
"&gt;Started as an emperor in the Byzantine Empire, did very well, died at the ripe age of 60.  &gt;Start playing as my son, who is 40, gay, a heretic and depressed. &gt;Kill myself. &gt;Continue on as a woman who conquers the Muslims.  11/10 would kill myself again",1
Fantasic modern update to a classic. Highly addictive stuff.,1
Awesome game to play w/ your friends,1
"10/10 Amazing game engulfed me in the story and the gameplay. Great job on this, this was amazing :D",1
10/10 would bang,1
"This game was horrendous when it first came out. That's why I didn't get it until about a year after. Rome II is probably my favorite TW because of the time period and the amount of mod support. There are so many unit mods for this game, I want to use them all (minus the cheat units).",1
"I've written before about the recent dea(r)th of 3D platformers. I've bemoaned the lack of games where learning to utilize momentum and all the tools at your disposal in a three dimensional environment is rewarding and fun.  Landfall Games, with Clustertruck, has hit that mark. As soon as you start up Clustertruck, you know what you're in for. You're going to be jumping from truck to truck until you hit a goal sign. For 90 levels, that is the sole goal. You will jump from white truck, to white truck, to white truck, until you pass through the area beneath the red Goal banner. While that sounds like it'd get repetitive really fast, you can summarize most games down to that level of simplicity. The thing Clustertruck masterfully understands is stripping away all the excess fat to really nail down level design, and in that area it has absolutely succeeded.  From the first level the movement is fun. It's fast, you need to be accurate, and the braver and better at aiming and controlling your jumps you are, the more you get out of it. For a few levels, you could just ride the back truck for a long time until you got to the part where it's necessary to jump. But that's absolutely not the way to play Clustertruck.   Clustertruck has levels that are all about trial and error, but for the most part you're going to want to go as fast as possible towards that goal sign. You'll want to leave your starter truck behind instantaneously, constantly jumping, looking for new trucks to get to. It's exhilirating the first time you play a new level because all levels start out the same: you, on a truck, moving forward. But it never stays that simple. Elevation changes. Trucks being launched. You being launched by superheated air, lasers to dodge, huge   pentagrams   rushing at you; there's never a time when Clustertruck is content to just keep going. Each level builds on the one before it, challenging you in new and creative ways, but always teaching you each mechanic, through gameplay, to make sure you understand it before throwing in a twist to keep you on your toes.  The levels themselves are divided into worlds of ten stages each; nine worlds each with not only a different visual style, but vastly different design, gradually ramping up in difficulty. There's a brilliance here, too, because while the game gets more difficult the more worlds you progress, you'll always finish a world on a very hard level and immediately the next level, in a new world, is much calmer and easier, letting you catch your breath as it teaches you something new. It's absolutely perfect pacing, and it satisfies that just-one-more-level itch of a game that you want to keep playing for gameplay alone.  Make no mistake: it's gameplay  alone  that Clustertruck offers. There's no semblance of story. There's no reason for you to be on these trucks, no reason for you to be in these worlds, and aside from the very end, no real sense of a goal being accomplished in any story-based sense of the word. It's you, the powerups, the trucks, and the levels, and nothing else. Nothing but an admittedly great soundtrack that keeps going and encouraging you throughout your many, many failures, and cheering you on during your successes. There's nothing better in Clustertruck than beating a level on the first try, sailing through it as though you've done it a thousand times before, and being rewarded with a First Try bonus.  That bonus system is tied to the Style Points system, the only non-level-based progression in the game. Each level you complete gives you points based on style, whether that's jumping off of flying trucks, getting air time, or completing it on your first try. Those points can then be used to unlock new movement abilities and utility powerups. Movement abilities are used with either the left mouse button (by default) or in the case of double jump, merely tapping your space bar (by default) again.  These are both fun to use and very situational. In most cases, you'll want double jump because it's the most versatile. But for speedruns and getting the best time, the air-dash is key. Grappling hook can make you pull off insane maneuvers, and the blink (a nice Dishonored homage, called the Disrespected Blink) is... well, it's fun. I couldn't find a practical use for it. There's a few others I didn't really get the chance to use, but needless to say, there's replayability there, using the right tool for the right run.  On the utility side, there's the most useful one: slow time. It slows time for you, the trucks, and the level, allowing you to nail a perfect landing that might've been a little too fast. There's also one that stops trucks (dangerous. I never got the hang of it), one that creates a truck under you, and my favorite, an homage to another first-person indie game. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's both super and hot. Okay, I'll spoil it, it's superHOT. The trucks move when you move, or when you're in the air. It's more for fun than for utility, but it brought a smile to my face. Be sure to right click when you have this utility active.  A level editor is included in the game from day one, with Steam workshop support. It seems pretty deep, so I can't wait to come back to Clustertruck in the months ahead to play new and exciting user-created content.  There's also a leaderboards system with friends filtering, so you can keep running levels to beat your friends... or the world. There's a ghost system for trying to beat a certain score's ghost, but I didn't play around with it, so I'm not sure how well it works.  Clustertruck is incredibly polished, but there are a couple issues that kept it from being perfect. The hitbox on certain wheels is hard to judge, so sometimes you'll brush them and it won't feel like it was your fault. There's also a small bit of jank with the way the climbing up the back of trucks (I call it the 'slingshot') mechanic works, where sometimes you'll get far more momentum than it feels like you should. It's nothing game-breaking in the slightest, but it can keep runs feeling inconsistent at times.  It's also not a very long game. I was finished with it at 4 hours, and there's no collectibles or anything to make you replay specific levels. I'm fine with that price : gameplay ratio, but others might not be. In addition, the very final level might frustrate some as it's got some mechanics you've never had to deal with in the main game before.  Don't let any of those things stop you, though; this game is already one of my favorites of 2016, and it earns that title by gameplay alone.  If you've got any interest in 3D platformers, games about speed and momentum, careful positioning, or dialogue-less humor (while the game's concept is funny enough, there's one joke level in world 8 that made me laugh out loud), you might want to give this one a shot. It's difficult, but not unfair. It gives back the more you put into it. It's got replayability and that arcade feeling of chasing that one high score that's just out of your reach.  Clustertruck is a game that is unashamedly nothing but gameplay. And that's something I'll always champion... as long as your gameplay is good. Clustertruck's gameplay isn't good. It's  excellent.   4/5",1
"How many steampunk themed teambased airship to airship combat simulators do you know of? Me? Just one. This game. And it's a damn good one at that! And with it being on sale at the moment of making this reccomendation for just £5.09 until 18 August, there has to be a damn good reason to NOT buy this game! 8/10!",1
This game is worth playing for story alone.,1
Such a fun and challenging game. Definitely worth the purchase.,1
I preordered this game and on release date it doesn't even ♥♥♥♥ing work. I didnt want to pay this much for playing loading screen simulator.,-1

"If you are die hard fan of zombies and apocalypse-related stuff like myself, then you are going to like this game. It has really good graphics for a mod and it's a lot of fun  7/10",1
"This is an extremely frustrating game if you're playing with an xbox 360 controller (I haven't played it with a keyboard). At random moments in the game the controller will get disconnected (and turning it off and on again does not re-establish a connection). Sometimes in the middle of a game the controller will have it's mappings messed up, rendering the game unplayable again. This is a real shame, because other than the controller issues the game is a lot of fun. It's just that when you're really getting into your stride and enjoying the game, the controller decides to disconnect and you're forced to go to the desktop and close the game. This controller issue with the game seems to be widespread, so I don't think it's a problem with my setup.",-1
Fun with a hint of extreme difficulty at times! Would definitely recommend playing with a partner.,1
one of the best games on steam and one of the best games ever made!,1
"Pretty fun overall, but you have to be into hockey and sports sim games",1
"Meh I thought this would be alot more interesting and fun, but overall it was pretty clunky and not what I expected from an FPS type game. There was very little instruction as to how to do things which sometimes I don't mind but in this case you don't get alot of time, especially when zombies pop out of nowhere behind you after you looked behind and there was nothing there.  Could have been better",-1
"Keep crashing, when I download this game my pc crash 5 times. i am using i7 intel cpu 6700K",-1
freaking hard! freaking awesome! u cry a lot haha,1
this is a fun game but it needs updates just i was wanted to play this so much but it seems like the requirements are too high,1
"Fun Definitely Beer &amp; Pretzels style, but a blast to play. Particularly good for those who recall the old Colonial Conquest.",1
One of the best metroidvanias out there. Very close to super metroid with some really novel power ups.,1
This game is life-changing experience 10/10,1
"Pros:   - Huge variety of heroes (More heroes are being added)  - All heroes are unlocked from the start  - Friendly Community  - Doesn't need a huge or expensive graphics card, thus any person with a good/decent rig can play the game  - Can be played offline by playing with bots or using LAN  - Game is free to play  - Continuous updates for the game are being done   - Well improved graphics than Dota 1  - Doesn't get boring or repetitive due to the diverse amount of heroes and the time it takes to perfect every hero.   - Perfects everything that was done in Dota 1  Cons:  - Game is addictive   - A decent internet speed is required due to constant updates and to play the game without any lags  - Time consuming (An average match takes about 40-35 minutes)   Verdict: 9.5/10",1

"It was really interesting &amp; fun game. Mostly its a time killer. I had fun playing it even for the second time. My boss also completed this game from my computer, he liked it :) I dont regret buying this game, but now I want to play more levels.  P.S. Не смог получить ключ на пикабу, но не жалею потраченых денег =)",1
"Right off the bat, this game feels like the original DOOM from the fast-paced movement to the hordes of demons. Everything is a solid throwback from the soundtrack, the sound effects of the doors opening and closing, and the red, yellow, and blue key cards to access different parts of the map. It isn't all old though, there are fun new systems that make killing and exploring extremely satisfying. The game does a great job of keeping you enticed to tracking down demons by providing a good breadth of challenges that are very rewarding. If you were a fan of DOOM 1 &amp; 2, I'd highly recommend this one. It'll throw you right into the action without having to sit through some thinly veiled story. DOOM does a great job of telling the story as you play. You get a real sense of what's going on in a very concise and quickly-delivered way so you know there is a reason for doing what you are doing, but it doesn't stop or slow you down from doing it.",1
"NOT A HERO, it is an absolutely hilarious, 2D action game with really nice pixel art (if you like pixel art). There are 9 characters that you unlock throughout the game and each play pretty differently from eachother (granted there are 3 of them I haven't played yet). There are only 2 things about this game that bother me: 1) When you die, you have to restart the level from the start (this might not be bad to some people, personally it just gets a bit annoying when you get really close to the end and then die by a simple mistake) 2) It's not too long. The game consists of 21 levels which you can get through pretty quickly for the most part, and I believe 3 secret levels that are hidden. Granted there are 3 varied side-missions within each level, there isn't too much replayability otherwise. Having said that, NOT A HERO is still an amazing and hilarious game and i definitely recommend it. My Rating: 14 wombats / A tree with guns",1
The very best game I own! It is slow to load but darn well worth it. I have over 1K hours on Steam in this game. A very unique way of financing the company is entirely optional but addictive.,1
I cried so much my face started to tingle 10/10,1
"I played this game for a brief amount of time to be honest but just because I couldn't find the fun in it after a few rounds.  The gameplay is pretty weird (I must accept it is innovative) but not very comfortable of fun.  Also, I could only play with one class with one set of weapons. I understand that the game expects to open the rest with experience points but I wished there was a little more variety for the people that just one to play a few rounds.  I might try it again in the future but for now I would not recommend this game.",-1
"No matter how hilarious you think the creatures in this game might look, if it's your first time playing it, it's bound to at least get your blood pumping. It's pretty scary! If the voice acting was done better, and the game remade by todays standards, people would definitely buy it just for the thrill of scare that it brings.",1
"Doesn't look like it at first, but it's actually fun and addictive to strategize, full of quirky humor.",1
"It is a fun game, i do recommand geting this game if you have 3 other frinds to play it with, and with mics",1
"Really can't get enough of this game. Played through it a couple of times (once on Steam and started a second playthrough, also played on Android).  Very good gameplay mechanics. Puzzles aren't that hard, but fun to do. Simplistic but pretty graphics. Nice and relaxing music/sounds. Perfect narrator voice. The story is not the best story ever, but it is good and it's narrated beautifully (which adds to the relaxing gameplay).  I definitely recommend this game.",1
Surprisingly moving for a 5 minute experience. 10/10 would fly again.,1
"It freezes up when trying to buy 25 levels at a time. Can't resize the window. I won't play it more unless they fix these issues. Otherwise, it seemed pretty fun.",-1
"FTL kicks ♥♥♥, It's a challenging space ship Rogue-Like which includes things like crew management and damage mitigation. It's a great challenge and should provide some good hours of entertainment.",1
"i like it, its fun, hope they make a sequel",1
Very good game. Played it in the alpha stage and enjoyed it. The programers have worked hard to get the bugs fixed and I always end up trying to figure out the best way to build the prision. There is also different modes like riots and fires that keep you on your toes if too many prisoners are unhappy.,1
"Wonderful game. Beautiful artwork, music at a high level and a great playability. As for me, the lack of flaws, I will recommend.",1
"'Use WASD+space bar to control the older brother, use ↑↓←→+R Ctrl to control the younger brother.' A nice joke made by the game producer. The moment when you press your space bar to control 'both of them', you will cry like a damn baby.  It's really interesting that when things appear to be about love, the languages that are used really don't matter at all.  Don't know how to describe the beauty of this game. Just wanna say that the scene where the whales appeared was GORGEOUS. Great soundtrack.  Just keep in mind: if the story doesn't make you cry, the controls will.",1
"Because of this game , now i can write the word whiskey correctly  27/10 Would pass the whiskey again.",1
"Going to be completely honest. I was super hyped for the game, waited a long while for it to go on sale to buy. It plays in the style of a one-man-army, you're an elite sniper who infiltrates enemy lines and completes various tasks.   My first issue is with the Sniping mechanics. They're sort of only halfway there. For example, when sniping, you need to take into account bullet drop. Fine. But you don't need to lead your bullet whatsoever, if someone is sprinting a mile away and you are able to click on them then it is a guarenteed kill. All weapons in the game are hit-scan, meaning the bullets hit their target the instant you click.  My second issue are the in-game hints. There are vaious things in the game that can mask your gunfire. One of which is some sort of little generator that is sprinkled throughout the game. But literally every time I see one, even super late game, my character says 'I bet I can mask my shots if I wait for that thing to make noise', even if I walk away from it and come back 30 seconds later.  The final nail in the coffin is Stability. I have modern hardware, everything up to date, supported OS ect. But within the first 3 hours of gameplay, I crashed 3 times, losing progress each time. I've had save files corrupt, Objectives get stuck so that I can't continue with the story. Just seems to have too many problems to be at it's normal pricepoint of $40",-1

"Spec Ops: The Line is an entertaining mainly single-player or coop third-person shooter. After getting it with the Humble Bundle (  https://www.humblebundle.com/  ). I enjoyed about 5 straight hours of playing this game. However, I don't really feel it is worth the $30 price point by any means. It's action-packed with an amazing storyline. Wouldn't recommend buying it throught steam though. You would be much better off getting it from a different website. Such as:  https://www.humblebundle.com/  for $8.25, or any other sight of your choosing.",1
"Wow I have not played this game for long and it already has me hooked. The physics is amazing, the gameplay is fun, and the story is pretty cool. I have been waiting for a good Lord of the Rings game ever since The Battle for Middle Earth trilogy, and this definitely takes its spot. Great combat, reminds me of the Batman Arkham series combat, but this feels much more refined. The enemies are interesting. There is not much in terms of customization, as you are stuck with a sword, bow and arrow, and dagger, but that very quickly becomes unimportant. The graphics are also very well done, but the game does not require the 6 gigs vram for ultra, as I can ultra everything with my 970 and still get over 60 fps. So far I have no lagged at all, and would say that it is quite well done in terms of pc optimization. I give it a 9/10. Definitely buy it or try it.",1
Love the game with prime gone RECOMEND YES!!!!!! ,1
so addicting,1
"Very self aware, interesting, although very short - would be nicer if longer. Really makes you think about things, also very addictive.",1
10/10 i was 9 years old when i bought this on steam this game i grew up playing and now in 2015 i forgot about it im a horrible person for forgetting such a masterpiece,1
"I won't spoil anything, because this a story-driven RPG Maker game. Despite being short, the story is interesting and you can explore your surrondings to get lot's of extra information. There's also a few side-quests, 3 endings and achievements. But get it on sale.",1
I remember when this was mixed. I tried it but it was meh... Now that it is Mostly Positive O.O I'm going to check it out... MAYBE I'LL LOVE IT?   Anyways I'd still definitely recommend this.  Classic (i guess) FPS game,1

"I've played this game since it was first released on the PS Vita a few years ago. Seeing it here on PC, gives a new and cooler look to the game. Not to mention, it seems to run much smoother on the PC then it does on the Vita.   The storyline and amazing mysteries are amazing to follow as you go around and solve the murders at the academy. The 1st person walk around is sweet since you get to walk around the academy more and more as you solve more mysteries. You get to even build relationships with the other students in the academy and learn about there back stories.  Those who've not gotten far and given up on playing it, have no idea what they are missing. A Superb story, amazing 2-D/ 3-D graphics, and awesome class trials. Can you solve the mystery of Hope's Peak Academy or will you fall and die in the death game of despair?   10/10",1
This version of the game is bugged. There are problems with the singleplayer campaign corrupting gamefiles. Would wait until this is fixed by the new dev.,-1
"Just an excellent game. Takes about 10-20 hours to play and is a great offline game (why I don't have more hours into this).   The story mixes with the actual game and makes a great combo the fighting is never boring due to the combination of guns and vigors (magic). The combat itself is hard and forgiving because of the fall back to a checkpoint style of death while at the same time keeping with the story which every part of this game does perfectly, there's no meta game moments which brings the world in a beautiful way to you, uninterrupted by gameplay. The game is fresh and unique while at the same time familiar and easy to grasp again.  The story is that of the best I've played for a long time and without giving away spoilers its one you most likely won't get until the game tells you. It gives you the nice twist you (should) expect and it ties it off, yet in a way that allows for another game after this.  === Complaints:   Choices don't matter in this game but they still make the world different and... well its related to the story.   There are no puzzles like I expected... aside from   The one in the very beginning regarding bells   and that... that's a joke.   Easy mode is... nothing normal is easy hard is normal and 1999 (konami code) is hard. by that I honestly mean that hard (normal) makes you use your skills and your guns or else, you can also make it through without any back tracking or grinding for money. Easy you could probably use your melee through the entire game. 1999, is the hard mode you expect, requires precision and sometimes may involve an actual use of vigor combinations along with just about anything else.   Last is the vigors... they are great and each person has their own favorites, once you find yours you wont stray too far except in some situational use.  === Warnings/Spoiler free tips:   If you fancy yourself a seasoned gamer I would recommend entering the konami code at the main menu (where you get an options menu) this will give you a tougher game mode and you don't have to repeat the game in hard / normal / easy. (although I will still play the game on the harder mode so that I can revisit and re analyze the game.)   Pay attention.   Collect the voice recorders to uncover the full story.  Story: 10/10 (WoAh, watch out for that twist) Gameplay: 9/10 (FPS, not very exciting. +Vigors or else it would be 7) Presentation: 10/10 (Good style) Soundtrack: 7/10 (Non memorable, a few snipets of pop culture type of music) Replayability: 5/10 (If you do it will feel like a chore, or that you have been betrayed by the game.)",1
"  Incredible game,one of the most innovative RTS franchises does it right once again.     Company Of Heroes 2 has a solid campaign,and also boasts a great multiplayer experience,all while maintaining an amazingly fun vibe throughout and keeping you on your toes. The AI is fun to mess around with on lower difficulties,and it can prove to be a force to be reckoned with on the higher ones.  Overall i must say this game is a must-buy for any fans of the RTS Genre,Total Score* for this game currently is :    8.5/10   -1 : The unit controls sometimes gets messy and can prove to be difficult to handle when in the heat of battle (Units not using cover automaticly when they're standing right next to it.)  -0.5 : The strain on the hardware can get tiresome at times with frame drops and the such.   Positives:      The Graphics :   I find myself marveling at the sheer beauty of the battlefields more often than you might guess,therefore i find the graphics to be worth mentioning in the positives section for this game.    The Combat :   Destroying a hostile tank has never felt this good,Company Of Heroes 2 features a fast paced,and frankly, a fun to use combat system. You get the decide the terms of the engagement,decide every action your units make and how they react to enemy actions,making the combat feel that much more immersive.   * - This score is subject to change in the future as i get more playtime in Company Of Heroes 2,For better or worse.

"What at first seems to be a quite simple game is very deceiving. The game has so many aspects that it is very easy to see why people invest hundreds of hours of playtime into this little jewel. What appears to be just mindless digging turns into a quest to dig the next tunnel to find better items. The more you play, the better this game becomes. If you have any doubts about buying this, visit the various Wiki's to see what this game has to offer.   Be afraid, be very afraid tho, this game draws you in &amp; you will find yourself saying just another 5 minutes more &amp; then realizing the next time you check the time, hours have passed. Even at the $10.00 retail price it's a gamer's dream, but it seems to be sold at half price more often than at retail. Buy this game, it will be money well spent, I'm sorry I did not buy it sooner. Give it a chance at first, it's nowhere near as simple &amp; mindless as it first appears. Every discovery opens up a myriad of new possibilities.  A great game that should be in every gamers library, it is not just a kiddie game, it's a game that people of any age group will enjoy. Why are you still reading this? You should be playing Terraria!",1
"NOTE: I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS FOR TRANSFORMERS G1 FANS. MY CHOICE MAY DIFFER FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FANS OF THE FRANCHISE.  Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, High Moon Studios' newest edition to the Transformers game series, is a marvel. It offers a new look into the past of Generation 1, while also not straying away too far.  Plot: After the events of War for Cybertron, the planet is close to being unihabitable. The Transformers are trying to escape, but with different goals. The Autobots, lead by the intrepid Optimus Prime, wish to patiently wait for Cybertron to reactivate while roaming space, but must battle the Decepticons, who wish to leave Cybertron, find a new source of power, and bring it back to rebuild in the image of their dreaded leader, Megatron, but not without killing the Autobots first.  Pros: - Good controls - Voice acting - Graphics - Weapons are unique and fun - Level design is fitted to specific characters - Environments - Multiplayer is a fun experience - Soundtrack  Cons: - You have to be familiar with the chracters - Multiplayer is full of glitches and (possibly) hackers - Crafted for Transformers fans (specifically G1)",1
It's fun but I'm a little disappointed with these so-called developers. They took out the beta version's difficulty where the game deletes its own save files every time you miss a thermos. The story is meaningless in the final product.,1
"Fun stuff. The only things that really got me down in this game were:  - almost-lack of a rocket launcher (there is one, but it's for special occasions) - in the last third or so of the game, stealth is just out of the question. Stealth was fun. - as so often happens, there's a brick wall of boss at the end of the game that really sours an otherwise fun experience. Plus, it's a dumb boss, nothing interesting about it, just pain.  Good stuff: - shootin' nazis on the moon - really simple stealth, and when you screw it up (easily), you can fight just fine instead of having to restart and try again",1
it was okay i guess,-1
♥♥♥♥ you devs for not giving us a thought out pc port. give me my controls thoughtfully,-1
Lol. You have to laugh.,-1
"The only MGS game I played other than Phantom Pain is MGS2 Sons of Liberty, so I'm quite unfamiliar with the series. Without comparing with more recent titles, I find Phantom Pain an absolute masterpiece that can easily suck one hundred hours out of my life. That's even more hours than Portal 2, if you think that was not enough praising.  (I'm not saying this game beat Portal 2, though.)  So since almost everything in Phantom Pain is satisfying enough, including graphics, storytelling, music and sound, field actions and stuff, I'll just focus on things I found particularly interesting and addicting.  First is the Mother Base. Basically this is a private army you are raising at the same time as you infiltrate enemy bases all alone. It brings some business management elements into the game, which is good distraction from the hardcore actions. As the Mother Base grows, you can get better support in field as return, such as more advanced weapons, the ability for air strikes or even change whether, etc. This Mother Base serves as the mother mechanism of everything: you finish missions to complete the game, you develop the Mother Base to help you finish the missions, and practically everything else you do helps develop the Mother Base.  So how do you grow your Mother Base? By the second addicting mechanic, Fulton extraction. You knock an enemy out, you Fulton extract him, and then he disappears from the field to join Mother Base. This also prevents this knocked out enemy from being discovered or raising an alert, so it's two birds with one stone. Besides extracting soldiers you can also extract wild animals, weapons, and in later stages, vehicles and material crates. It is strangely entertaining to Fulton extract an enemy truck with two soldiers still sitting in it. This mechanism is the one I found to be MOST addicting.  Third, Quiet the legendary sniper is god-damn beautiful. Spoiler:   By achieving a 100% bond with Quiet, and not taking any shower for a long time, you get to shower with Quiet. *wipes nosebleed*    However there is one thing I don't like about Phantom Pain: missions get repetitive. There 150+ side ops you can take, but they fall into just a small number of categories, like 'Rescue Prisoner 01', 'Rescue Prisoner 02“, ..., 'Rescue Prisoner 20'. Also in the second half of the main storyline, I wonder if they ran out of ideas or what, a lot of the missions just repeat earlier missions with added difficulty.  + Satisfying graphics + Immersive music + Collectibles + Raise an army to help you fight as you fight - Repetitive missions - Story gets confusing for new players  10 out of 10, masterpiece.",1
"For any one thinking of buying this or even the starter pack,, save your money,, since a few updates ago,, it has been running super slugish even out of game... they did something and now its acting like I am on dial up when even opening supply drops... once I get into game,, its fine besides the fps drops but every one is getting that,,, even if you have a high proformance pc.. Just watch Preston's videos,, he has to reboot every game or the fps will cripple his gameplay. Activision is too worried about feeding their wallets than to fix any proformance issues. It is a awesome game but there is no point when there is constant lag and fps issues within the game itself. Buy at your own risk. The way it is now... I wish I could get a refund on the game and every penny I sunk into the game.",-1
"RECOMMENDED BARELY FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS.   Disclaimer: I'm a gamer who likes atmospheric worldbuild-y character development stuff. So being matched up with Warframe?  Probably  not the best idea. That being said, played it for some months last year, stopped, occasionally felt like installing it again but didn't. Hearing about Mesa and some of the updates since then have been mildly tempting, but in the end my decision remains the same. Why? Well...  If you came to play a perpetual shoot-and-grind where you are absolutely happy just shooting whatever comes in view and grinding hours upon hours just to unlock the parts to that sweet new armor, then this game is  perfect ... because that's really all this game is. But even then: every mission becomes the same after a while, all the armor and weapons you unlock don't seem too different from each other in the end, enemies are the same,  everything  becomes the same and totally lackluster after a while. Grinding takes a ridiculously long time, but you can earn almost everything this way. Kudos to that at least. But you might as well P2W because everything can be bought anyways without all the effort.   (And plot?  Pfft , what plot? This game doesn't have one.)   TL;DR 7.8/10 for being a monotonous F2P shooter that isn't worth anything but casual murder sprees as a ninja (IN SPACE! Friends optional) and killing time when you have nothing else to do. Just expect a hefty grind in the process. 0/10 for anything story-related, character-interaction-related, or... anything else. Maybe someday. Just not anytime soon.   11/10 on graphics though. Only truly well done thing about this game. And hey, gotta love that sweet, sweet post-apocalyptic futuristic wasteland aesthetic.",1
"Great Game! Not sure why it wasnt mroe popular. Its like a better version of wow, most of the same things with a spacey vibe.",1
"This video features a quick look @ the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDJaITPqwow   A visually impressive twin stick shooter that's a treat to the senses.  Game Description: Bezier is a dual stick blaster set inside a vast computer built deep underground. The story traces the principal's escape from this 'Noah's Ark' gone wrong. A simple shooter on the surface, the deeper narrative pulls in his relationship between evolution and god, family and love.  Recommended? Yes!",1
This Game It's Amazing And Funny! BUY THIS GAME!,1
"If you like bad graphics, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad variety, and a bad soundtrack, then this is the bad game for you.",1

Water ballon fights...THE GAME,1
"At first, what the f#ck happened to this game?  Quake Live via Steam became a Quake for casuals. It's not even Quake anymore. It's just a rip-off. A really really bad rip-off. No alt-tab? Thanks. Starting gun loadouts? Timers on armor/regen/quad damage? Thanks. Railgun = 80 dmg per shot? THANKS! Bhop by holding space? Oh my god.. Universal ammo packs? Thanks. No Gore? OH MY GOD... HEALTH REGEN? OH - MY - GOD. Absolutely disgusting voice reminders? No more epic 'EXCELLENT!' or 'DENIED!!1'? Seriously, just WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? You want to charge me 36$ per year to get the full access to a game I used to play 10 years ago?  Good luck with that. If i ever wanted to play quake, i'll play Q3A CPMA. Not this poop. Worst rip-off i've ever seen in my entire life.",-1
"Very fun and unique game, what makes it special and unique from other games of its kind is its variety, leveling up individual units, and the factions that play completly separatly. There are also missions you can send your mercenaries on to get gold just like in the assassins creed games, and is a good way to make some extra dough. Im not the biggest Strategy fan but im having a blast with this game.",1
"Truly one of the greatest games I have ever played. Not only is the gameplay challenging and well balanced, the game is one of few that makes you not only think about the moral consequences of conflict in game but contemplate it in real life as well. The desicions all have repercussions whether one realizes it or not, and forever affects the ingame survivors. I give this game as hearty a recommendation as I can.",1
how do u stop the lag,1
"I have played it through. To be honest at the end it was just to finish it, for the sake of finishing it. It is not totally rubbish. It can be enjoyed, particularly if you don't have any preconcieved nostalgia (I played all originals and enjoyed them a lot more than this, but that was a long time ago).  Bad -Characters are shallow -Repetative environments -QT like events to open windows, transition to areas, no point as can't fail just mash E for the sake of it. -QT like take downs -The city is a bit bland, and traversing it seems like a chore after the first time -Feels like they rushed it in the end and didn't polish it properly  Good -Stealth -Some interesting levels and story discoverys -A couple of engrossing startle moments -Don't have to return to quest giver to get reward  I would not have bought it if it was not part of a bundle that made it super cheap. I am Glad that I didn't pay full price. ",-1
A golden piece of art,1
"Very very fun game. Provides many different ways to approach each heist. You could go in guns blazing, and attract every cop in the area. Or you could take a stealthier approach, and complete a heist solo. Either way, the possibilities are endless. And then, once the heist is over, you feel more rewarded with things like unlocks, masks, and weapon mods. And don't even get me started on the skill trees. This game will provide hours of entertainment. Get it. Now.",1
"Awesome game.  Neps, everything. &lt;3",1
"linux version not updated, servers and windows versions updated, some wtf!",1
"This game is much imporved over 2k15. It's still got some flaws, but still a pretty decent game. Wish they would bring back create-a-finisher. That was one of my favorite things about 2k14, and 13. Had some problems loading up the game when I first got it, which was annoying, but with some research, it got fixed. Shouldn't be happening to a game, especially with a $50 price tag. All in all, it's still pretty fun to play from time to time.",1
  Call of duty=The Best game in the world &lt;3,1
"Probably one of the best games I've played in a long time. A wonderful commentary on the millennial generation.  Put aside everything you expect from games nowadays: I.E. good graphics, game mechanics and controls, straightforwardness. Look at it for what it is, a medium to discuss topics of our age.  The best example I can give is 'abstract art'. If you go into an art museum expecting clean images and clear messages to the viewer, but end up looking at modern art all day, it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Why? Because your preconceptions are clouding your ability to interpret the multiple layers of the image.   Do not let Kevin VanOrd’s GameSpot review deter you, it is clear he is one of the people who couldn’t look past his own preconceived notions of what a game “should” or “should not” do.   10/10, and worth every minute.  ",1
"I hate the gamepad. Mostly because it's not intuitive to control a 3D camera with the thumbstick and you have control with only 4 fingers. Unfortunately most developers design their games for the gamepad when it can be better controlled with a keyboard and mouse. But Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is different. It has a top-down camera perspective and the camera can be rotated in the 2D plane using the bumper buttons. Most of the time the game itself rotates the camera in the desired direction for you so you can forget about the camera completely. And this game has no crazy combos, twitch timing or quick-time events to execute. You must be wondering why I am talking about the controller so much at the start for a game review. It's because in this game the gamepad genuinely has a clear advantage over the keyboard and mouse. If you are not using the gamepad to play this game you will be losing a lot on what this game has to offer.    This game is as the title says a tale of two sons. The brothers are on a journey to find a cure for their father's illness. You take control of the brothers both at the same time and guide them through a beautiful fantasy world in search for the cure. The older brother is a bit serious in character whereas his younger brother is slightly mischievous. You will meet a lot of interesting characters on your journey - some helpful, some in need of help, some being a hindrance, some monsters and even some helpful monsters. The brothers and all the other beings in this game talk in a completely different language. You have to understand what they are saying through gestures and tone of voice. You can interact with certain characters or objects with each brother interacting in a different way. There are some optional interesting side quests in the game which are really easy to miss if you don't scan the environment and most of the Steam achievements are related to the side quests.    You will have to coordinate the movement of both the brothers as well as complete tasks together. For example, the big brother can help a leg up for his younger brother so he can climb up a ledge and pull down a rope for him. The little brother can slip past door grates whereas the big brother can pull heavy levers. The little brother is afraid of drowning so the big brother has to shoulder him while swimming. The platforming sections are real easy and there is really no challenge or difficulty in this game. This game is all about the experience that you get while playing. There are enemies but most of the time it's either about escaping them or trapping them. You will likely die more by falling off a cliff than by an enemy.    The game is made in Unreal Engine 3. So there are some nice visuals. There aren't much polygons to see as this is an indie game but the shadows and ambient particles make up for the visuals giving a great atmosphere to the fantasy world. The music also adds to the atmosphere. The control scheme is really innovative. It uses the symmetry of the gamepad to control the two brothers using the thumbsticks and triggers. You can't find such symmetry on the keyboard. But more important is the feel that it gives you. They is no way to explain this 'feel' but you will certainly understand it by the ending sequence of the game. There are also some cool force feedback effects. The game is short lasting about 4 hours offering very less replayability. But there isn't much to complain about it being short since it was available for as low as 1.49$ on a Steam sale.    The Good :  + nice little adventure + innovative control scheme + great atmosphere + emotional touch + suitable for all ages    The Bad :  - no difficulty or challenge - short with no replayability - does not have AAA Hollywood style blockbuster scenes - not a benchmark tool    Verdict : 86/100  A great atmospheric game where the gamepad genuinely beats the keyboard and mouse.",1
 An intoxicating open-world masterpiece,1
I seriously recomend getting the deom before you buy as it still has serious problems running on certain PCs for what ever reason...,-1
This game is all about goat. How you become a goat (good goat/bad goat) is up to you. ,1
"A game that keeps its cards close to its chest.  A very funny game to take at the second degree. At first it seems foolish, but actually, it's a lot more than just that. If you don't take it seriously, you'll spend some time laughing your head off, and if you spend some more time trying to get all the success of the game, you'll be able to see the deepest side of the story, and the most interesting.  If you're looking for something original, don't go farther, it's here.",1
"hid in a red cabinet then ran from a guy for 2 minutes before getting cut and thrown on a hook, only to later be fished out of the blackened sky by a giant tentacle-like fish hook. would not free-weekend again. i'd r8 this b8 str8 0/8m m8",-1
"Essentially the same as the first game but this time you can sometimes ask the worst-trained marines on the planet to help be body-shields for you. Seemed like this one has more emphasise on combat than story-line and does introduce a few new enemies while revisiting familiar locations. You may even see a familiar mute with glasses running around for a bit. *nudge nudge hint hint* I didn't enjoy very much that health and ammon drops were fairly rare which made things a bit more tedious than expected.  If you liked the first one and wanted a short expansion on the universe (took me 6 hours), this is an excellent choice. 7/10",1
this game is amazing my only problem is that it is too short should be longer,1
"Enjoying a lot :)  No bugs for me.  ----------------------------------- UPDATE- 7/30/15--------------- Just finished the game. I felt the game got better after the first act....which sort of makes sense. First Act is really getting your feet under you, understanding the the mechanics, world, story etc... I switched difficulty to hard shortly after act 1, as I finally understand combat, spells etc... The combat was much more tactical after I did that.  All in all enjoyable game, nice to see this style of game back. I hope for more games liked this and hopefully improving on it, I am sure Obsidian will improve.   Also, not one bug the whole 122 hours...",1
"Good game, need some skills to play and need some patient as well. just do not give up if you get destoried by the first boss. keep trying and then you will start to enjoy it.",1
"its a short game, but its ok. they should make another one, just longer and with more stuff. they two only compains i have is , they game shut down alot &amp; and the thropy 'no knockdown, all beats' why you gotta do this twice to get it?",1
1 of the best free game awesome graphics and easy to understand game,1
"It's a bit straight forward, and by a bit I mean a lot in conventional gaming lingo, but for a defence game it just feels off that the towers are not upgradeable to the max (all of them) and that you rely more on losing over and over to boost your lv. to be able to get to the next level. I really would not dare to buy it (I tried the free trial) because it has potential but it simply not a defence game... there isn't enough focus on the defence part and it is based in an 80% on you, the player, to do all the work which is basically just stand in there and take hits while unloading on the enemy. There are more negative than positive comments regarding the game, it may be an improvement in certain areas over the 1st Sanctum, but it simply isn't enjoyable as other free to play games. The only good thing is the trailer, it gives a false sense of action packed gameplay when it actually is more like: 'I'll kill 40% of the waves and then start all over until I get some one to play with me and not be cooperative, as in most online coop games, or get enough firepower to do it myself'.  On a side note: I was crying of laughter with the chat system, my friend and I were fooling around with it instead of actually playing xD.",-1
"Fun game, although definitely hard at times, but still worth it (plus it's free :D). Also try it with a controller, helps a lot!",1
  The game is epic!,1
better the cod,1
"When the special edition of Skyrim came out, a couple of friends asked me, 'What is your favorite open world game?'. It didn't require much contemplation because even though I tried out a lot of open world games including Skyrim, I can say that without a doubt, the Witcher 3 is my most favorite. All the other games including Skyrim mentioned here are not bad games in their own right at all... But I believe that the Witcher 3 is one of the best examples if not the very best example of demonstrating how a video game is an art form that can be appreciated for its majestic qualities.   The soundtrack, the characters, the themes, the story and writing feel very human and relatable and that makes me feel so much for this game. It has given me such an immersive adventure that made me feel connected to the world. I just wanted to say something finally after almost 1 year and a half since launch so that people who still need a great game to play can start here. This game will always have a special place in my heart &lt;3",1
"It's like a hilarious Tamagotchi with time management. Grind your stats and then watch fights that are automated. I came across a few little bugs or graphic glitches, but overall I thought this was fairly well done and a good time waster when my cat was sleeping on my other hand. Pretty casual.",1
"Here's my adive to any company that thinks they make strategy games. If your company is losing money, just make a game like Homeworld, and than... your company will suddenly start making money. Its that easy. Why go to business school? Classy, well-mastered, and I don't even have a lot of hours on it, but I am just blown away. Simple, yet so well made, I got this game in 2015, mind you I was born in 1995, making me a 4-year-old when they launched this game. Thank you 1999, and thank you developers, your game has stood the test of time.",1
One of my all time favorite games AND NOW IT'S ON PC! It's a great purchase but remember to pack a gamepad.,1
"Really good game, I love it. I can recommed it for everyone, who likes tactical FPS games. :)",1
"The game is pretty great, in my opinion. It has a good amount of levels, each one well-built and memorable with a different theme. I guess really talented players could breeze through it, but it took me a while to complete the game, so I spent my money's worth of time on it. It controls pretty well, at least with using a keyboard, and it wasn't unfair most of the time. I liked the atmosphere, with the calming music and neat art style. The ending, without spoiling anything, was very strange and a little eerie, but in a good way? It was sometimes unfair/infuriating though, which is different than the rest of the game (hard, but fair - not rage inducing). I guess whether or not it's really worth your money depends on if you like platformers, which I do.",1
I came here to write a review Then I realised its portal and I don't need to.. 5/7 would get abused by a robot again,1
"The most incredible game I've played in a very long time. Bioshock Infinite is the best possible scenario: a game that you know is going to be good, but that still manages to exceed your expectations. Action, story, enviornment, graphics, gameplay... it is totally engrossing and is the first game in awhile that is worth every penny of the $59.99 price tag. Top to bottom, simply brilliant - do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME!",1
This game is fun for multiplayers with friends i think everyone should get this if they want to play with friends  ,1

"I was never a big fan of RPGs. That said, I had low expectations going into this game. My god was I wrong. Undertale has an amazing storyline, countless memorable characters, and a unique combat system that I've never seen anything like it. Everything about this game is amazing. If you are thinking of buying it and you are not sure if you will like it, buy it. For only $10 it's a steal, really. I would buy it again even if it were $20, even $30. My point is, this game is an experience. The puzzles aren't great. 10/10",1

"In my first playthrough I wrote a novel that was so good it instantly became part of the American literary canon, enjoyed a passionate and sexually charged life with my wife, and screwed up my son so badly that he was doomed to a miserable life of crappy jobs and few friends.

Best open world and multiplayer game,1
"ok so i have 287.7 hrs at the time of writting this, and i must say that i have fallen in love with the game, its difficulty curve makes you come back for more, and the monstrous reckage (of both player and monster) that is late game leaves almost nothing to desire,  if you come from d3 then welcome,  pros:  its free,  its awesome,  nothing is broken,  the devs always fix thing, (ofc there are a few things that dont really work, but nothing is perfect) new content every 3-4 months (challenge leagues)  cons:  you will die  you will boot up the game not knowing anyhting, go through normal and cruel difficulty saying to yourself that this is an easy game and my build is awesome, then you reach Merciless, and you will cry as you realize you have no Elemental Resistances and you have not enough health to deal with even the normal mosnters of late game  Death means something in this game, Cruel and Merciless difficulties impose an experience penalty on death, therefore build defence instead of offence a ratio of about 1-3ish nodes of dmg to defence  Normal thought patterns of 'i will kill them first before the come to me' does not work, pure glass cannon will not work   Conclusion:  an awesome game, difficult but fair (the first 2 difficulties are all about you getting the fundementals of the build set in stone so that you can start grinding late game effectively)  i highly advise you look up guides on how to level characters:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdSazSpgEs  this willl help once you have the fundementals you can go and explore Wraeclast  and always say ty and gl when trading",1
"This might just be the second game to ever actually make me panic. The first being Dark Souls. And much like Dark Souls, it is like a beautiful bride who is perfect in every way... Except she punches you in the nose every five mintues. No reason at all, she just does. And you still love her. Though... Unlike Dark Souls this makes you question your humanity. Will you be a well-stocked Hobo-bludgeoner, or will you be a person of honour starving and barely hanging on to life for the sake of others? The choice is yours to make. Highly suggested, must play.",1
"Thea: The Awakening is an unique mix of Strategy, Survival, Tactical Cardbased Combat (and Challenges), RPG and Roguelike.  It doesn't have the depth of each of those genres but the well balanced mix of all of them makes up for that. The setting is a mix of fantasy and slavic mythology which is a nice change and especially the mythology part is nicely embedded in the many quests also the artstyle fits really well.  It's hard to list up and explain all the aspects of this game because everthing is well intertwined together. But everything adds one thing to the game either through randomness or depth: replayability.  There are a lot of ressources to discover, each one with unique abilitys. They are used in weapons, armor, tools and buildings which are getting different benefits depending on the material used to craft them. F.e.: A palisade out of gold attracts dwarfs to join your settlement, if it's made out of steel it attracts orcs instead; a weapon made out of blackwood gets a poison effect, if it's made out of obsidian it get's a bonus to stealth. Since the game is randomly generated you usually get different ressources with an easy access each playthrough so you can focus on different things each time, like getting a good chance to get demons to join your village or make a lot of armor which boosts your magic. There are a lot of different races and skills to get out of this. But you also have to do risky expeditions later on to get to the usually rare and powerful ressources. And since the game has a day and night cycle it's not always a good idea to venture too far. The many skills you can get are used mostly for challenges, but each has a purpose: either offensive, defensive or as a support skill. These challenges are using a tactical cardbased mechanic which is neither too simple nor too complex, it's well thought out.  The Randomness the game has is not for everyone, you can get absolutely screwed sometimes, and sometimes it can be a little too easy, but that's exactly why i like it: you just don't know what you'll get and even if you feel strong you can loose unexpectedly or at least suffer a heavy defeat.  The Game does have some downsides so far, but that's expected in early access. The UI does it's job, but definitely could benefit from a lot of comfort features like shift-clicking to equip/unequip something, a filter function for the expedition creation and so on. Spelling mistakes are relatively common, and after a while the fights against bees, crows etc. can get a little annoying. Also i think the endgame needs a little more balancing. But that's nothing that can't be fixed before release.   Otherwise the game runs very stable, i didn't had any crashes or gamebreaking bugs and only one annoying bug i can remember after 50 hours.    If you can deal with the randomness you can easily get your value out of this game.  Edit after Release: They improved the UI and the hole game by a lot, the only thing i still don't like about this game is the tidious equipment management which can take a while, but other then that i don't have any complaint anymore.",1

"I've played the wii u version more so don't mind my time. resy rev. is spinoff from the main series and id a approch back to survival horror, while the game still lacks in scares it makes up for it with good storyline, atmosphere, and gameplay. the controls are great with mouse and keyboard unlike resy.6 and over all and enjoyable experince 8\10",1

A never ending game worth playing again and again,1
First I have to say that I did not like the artistic direction or the setting of the game (cold war era). What is wrong with the 'sometime in the near future'? And why such a cartoony artwork? However this IS the ufo enemy unknown remake that everybody was waiting for. It is faithful to the original to a fault. Whatever is not like the original xcom is a well thought improvement that we all wished the original had to begin with. In short this game is a must for old timers like myself and a must for newcomers that have not experienced the awesomeness that was xcom in the 90s. Now if only the devs would make something terror from the deep like for the first expansion.,1

"So so so so so...  Weapons are bugged as ♥♥♥♥ed (You shoot more bullets in a second than a f*cking gatling!) Ground textures glitching No cooldown on zombies spawn The game can't show more than 2 items at the same time (exemple: You have 2 woods on the ground, you take one, and PAF, a third one appear!) Really small map  And, the village... 2 house, and a (empty) farm..  Wow, i'm happy that i got this game with a bundle X) ",-1
"This will be the first review I've ever written about a game, and that already says a lot about how I feel about this game. So, excuse my 'unprofessionalism'. Also, I'm not a native English speaker, so if you find any weird misspellings or such, you may keep them. ;)  To make things short for the impatient: I have no idea why IGN and even some others gave this game low-to-mediocre ratings. Maybe being professionals and having to play games not for fun but for a living, has just made them too cold-hearted to feel the magic this game brings. To me, it is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and it will take it's rightful place among my all-time favourites. If you haven't played it yet - you really should.  Now I'll at least try to sum up my thoughts.  While the visual style is nice, fancy graphics aren't exatly 'Life is Strange's strong suit. And it absolutely doesn't have to be. This game wants to tell a story to all the people who are willing to take some time, lean back and listen. And this is where the game truly excels.   The way the player is slowly drawn into the strange happenings currently going on in the fictional coastal town of Arcadia Bay is almost peerless. While episode 1 still felt like a school-story with a twist and maybe a good atmosphere to me, I've found myself losing myself more and more in the game's ideas and background as the episodes progressed, up to the point where I'd still ponder theories and connections within the story when I was lying in bed, drifting off to sleep.  The game's hauntingly beautiful atmosphere is tangible, thanks to mostly stellar voice acting and superb character design, even though the game does dip a little to deeply into the stereotypes sometimes. All the characters are believable, and Dontnod does an excellent job of biasing the player to the intended attitute towards specific characters based on their behaviour. For an example, there is the arrogant know-it-all school bully Victoria Chase, whom I started to hate from the get go, until I got to know her better. Or the disturbed and unstable Nathan Prescott, son of a rich local family, who immediately has a 'root of all evil' aura around him. Not to mention Chloe Price, the seemingly loud and rowdy punk girl, whose pain and suffering can really felt by the player. All the characters, from big to small, feel meaningful and realistic, and the game's heroine Maxine 'Max' Caulfield easily stands out for herself, as one of the sweetest and most lovable characters I've ever seen - I positively adored her at times.  The game also delivers on it's decision making system. The crux here is that Max can rewind time to remake decisions - but to a limit. And more often than not I've found myself wondering about how my choice would later impact things to come or if I really had made the right choice. There are a lot of tough decisions to make in this game, you can trust me on that. I do have to admit though, I would have liked to see just a little more impact from some of my decisions.  The storyline twists and turns at times and it does offer some nice surprises for the unsuspecting player. It is a story that wants to be told. And even though the idea is not new, it is brilliantly executed and absolutely thrilling.  The game certainly does have it's flaws. Sometimes it's just too stereotypical, lip-synch is bad, there are some really blurry textures, and all in all there really aren't any puzzles that are actually challenging.  But that doesn't change the fact that this game is amazing.  In a sea of drab no-risk blockbuster titles that feel like they all came out of the same little box on the hillside (sorry, couldn't resist the lame cross-reference), this game is a shining beacon of so much more, with so much heart and warmth the developers have poured into it.  This game is not just another game. It proves once more that video games can truly be a piece of art and I am really glad that at least here on Steam and on various websites it's getting the praise it deserves by the people it was intended for - us players.",1
Start the game. Try a level. Die. Ragequit. After the 50 death. And then... Play it aggain.  I like this game!,1
"It's as Devil May Cry, as it can be... a must buy",1
"  I find it funny someone said this game is fun for a few hours, then gets boring. I got bored after 20 minutes.   I don't recommend this game (I would give it a thumbs sideways, if Steam would implement that!), but I definitely don't feel any animosity for the developers, because they accurately described and advertised their game as something you should probably pass on. I didn't even buy it as it's on a free period as I type this (hense me checking that I received it for free) and it would have only been $2.50 if I had bought it.  I got bored really quickly as most people have seemed to do. The only thing fun is the spectacle of seeing all there is around the map(s), but that couldn't carry me through. I like the idea of games like this, where they're not really about challenge, story, or anything, just messing around and having fun. The music really gave me a sense of whimsy like a cartoon or webshow (such as Homestar Runner and by extension Strongbad's Cool Game for Attractive People). I'd really like to see more games take this sort of 'just mess around and have fun' attitude which I think is really the spirit of sandbox games, such as Just Cause 2, the Tony Hawk series (which obviously influenced this game a lot), and freemode in the GTA series.  It's on the extreme end of the sandbox spectrum just before you get to games like GMOD which give you all the tools to do anything. This game does have mutators which I absolutely love (though I didn't even try them out, which I'm tempted to play again just to do so as I think about it), as they're a form of modding a game without actually having to let the player mod it. This game does support mods with the Steam workshop (it seems), which tempts me to buy it right now just for that alone. It's very sad to see mods become less and less supported by mostly AAA developers (which is just another point against those pigs!) and why I really appreciate it in any game that does have it (DOOM 4 didn't have mod support? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious?!). It's just great to have control over a game you payed for and modding and mutators are just part of that.  One of the reasons I didn't just buy it anyway, was because it runs pretty poorly on my system, not even maxed out. My hardware is certainly dated, but so are the graphics of this game, though I understand that it probably takes a lot of processing power calculating all the different interactive objects. I don't think it's a stretch to assume it's not the most optimized game, so that's bad, but either way, I simply can't run this at a pleasing framerate and graphical level.   I know it's supposed to look sort of cheesy and glitchy, but I really think it hurts the game more than it serves it's sense of humor in many ways. I don't like the way the game looks or feels as it's obviously (pretty much intentionally) unpolished and whether a game looks aesthetically pleasing or not, it needs to FEEL right. The way you move and interact in this game simply feels unfinished to me.  Summary: The spectacle wears off too quickly to make this a substantial purchase. Consider buying it on sale.",-1

I could go on and on about all the things this game gets right so I'm going to end my review here with this - If you enjoy ARPG's, just buy this game and try it.

"I really wanted to like this game. I really, really, did. I'm sorry to say however, I can't reccomend it. Sure it has good graphics, decent AI, nice customization. However there is one really big problem that prevents me from giving this game a good review: The grinding. While I get it shouldn't be EASY to buy a schooner, it shouldn't be as hard as it is. The ship isn't super expensive per sei, but the quests pay so little that it takes an unbelievably long time to attain the required capital. If you want a more fun experience, get Tempest instead.",-1

"Electronic Super Joy: Groove City is the sequel to the first game titled 'Electronic Super Joy'. It's about a city named 'Groove City' being destroyed by a giant robot stripper named JoJo, she is mad because a guy named Dr. Swinger stole her laser nipples and you go on a quest to reclaim them... yeah, I'm not joking. It's really short, you may complete it in under 2 hours AND unlock all the achievements even tho it is very difficult. But the comedy in this game is better, well, lets just say the jokes are ''not good'', but you'll still laugh at them for an unknown reason. There is a scoring system also, and getting the points can be very difficult, you either have to find a secret area and dodge enemies and there are also points that you can pick up, but they'll launch missles at you, which is a nice twist. The really good part of the game which not many people notice is that there are patterns, you don't just go through your obstacles and hope for the best, no, the game is too hard for that. There is no random generation after going through a checkpoint, so you can get to one place, try one thing a few times, if it doesn't work, then you go try to find another approach at the obstacle, but if it does work, then you can stick to doing it every time until you find the other step and finally get through the really hard obstacle you spent hours trying to go through. The game is also not too difficult, you CAN complete even tho it seems too hard for you. My rating: 7",1
Nominated for most deserving of a sequel,1
"Great game, has a awesome story mode, with a ok multiplayer. It also has a multitude of mods, ranging from full conversion mods, to UI and graphical mods. It also has a incredible multiplayer DLC, which is where I have spent the majority of my almost 300 hours played.   This game can be had on sale for as low as $1-2, with the DLC's (excluding Viking Conquest) availible for around $.99.  I would honestly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys one of the following: Skill driven melee combat, a 'empire building-rogue warrior' type story, or the ability to mod to your hearts content.  10/10",1
"As with the case of the previous 'Call of Juarez' - games (except The Cartel), 'Gunslinger' is a very smooth and fun experience. Instead of trying to be a polish version of 'Red Dead Redemption', the developer Techland has focused on creating a beautiful west like gamers want it to be.  The missions are short, but the gunplay is very rewarding and you have to pull yourself away if you don't want to finish the game in one sitting.  Excellent voice acting and graphics elevate this game above many other in the genre, and is a must play for any FPS-lover. ",1
"It's hard to pinpoint what one thing makes New Vegas such a good RPG. It's a culmination of a number of different aspects that come together into a single, well crafted Role Playing experience. Where your character is truly yours to build and play how you want.   If you want to play as a straight up shooty character, you can do that, if you want to be an outdoorsman, living off the land, hunting for your food, you can do that. If you want to be a pacifist and play through the game without killing a single thing, you can even do that. There's rarely a restriction on how you play the game with quests usually having numerous ways to tackle them.  The game and your character is yours to play and everything about the game is designed to facilitate just that. A fantastic RPG for the ages.",1

Every living organism around you is also invincible. You can stun people by headbutting them, lick them and drag them onto the road. Even put it in slow motion as the truck runs over them! No blood what-so-ever. You can unlock new goats, such as the Tall Goat, which is actually a Giraffe... Uhh. This is Goat Simulator right? Whatever. Buy this game! Stunning graphics, and great fun!

If you are considering getting this game, Its always easy to find players for a group, Invite system is great!. Never fail to get a team for something!  I played this game on console.. I was actually gonna start all over again. I realised that I could transfer my console status to PC. So i got to carry on where i left off. So thats a great feature (Any console account can be transfered) For me, I think the game is better on the PC.. And was well worth the wait!  I have had alot of fun on this.. But a decent amount of time in since i've had this game, alone and with friends.  The reason for the 9 is simply..... When you are playing with friends in a server session (Driving around in open world, killing other players [for example]) You would be randomly disconnected from that session, but it actually says everyone left.. So i don't know if thats one of us having issues, or weather its a game issue. Most of the time performance is great!  So my verdict is..  GET THIS GAME!!",1
I played this game alot in its original version As of writing thid review I played it for nearly 400 hours in this new version and I plan on continue playing it  It is va very enjoyable RTS game. I think that it is much more intersting than some of the more classical RTS like AOE because of the different managing of ressources and the control of the map,1
This is my sim city killer. Although it may not have the exact same elements it does bring in an interesting naval combat ability. I really like the way the building feels and placing things the way you want feels easy. This is important since the islands you settle can be small. The vaarious production chains you have to mange are awesome and the trade routes are excellent. All around I would recommend this game to anyone who would rather not play simcity because EA is trash.,1

"I'm talking about Multiplayer, not the main Game. Keep in mind, Thanks! So, let's start. When you buy the game, and go to the multiplayer, searching for match, first thing you'll see that, your team: Level 9 No prestige, Level 55 No Prestige, Level 14 Prestige 3,...etc, It's not bad, because cool playing with newbies but. Enemy's team: Full Prestige, Full prestige, Level 4 Prestige 6 etc. That's a little bit damn but, ok, you still start the game. So, theres alot of guys with An-94, what's high range, high dmg, = you 1 shot. You can still beat them, ok. Second thing. Max prestige guy, LMG *diamond* with target finder, camping the whole game. Another, 2 max prestige goes with Ballista and camp with the LMG guy. Cool, isn't it? You can have 0.01 stat in seconds! Because BO2 lobby system is so 'nice' to you places all the strong enemy at the enemy team. (I don't talk about bad team, NO BAD TEAM, just BAD TEAMWORK) ",-1

"Just take a look at my hours played before reading this. 250+ hours. I've been through a lot, man.  Anyhow, if you don't know what Town of Salem is, it's a game where 7-15 random people (mostly 15) are in Salem with the witch hunts and crap like that. Before the game starts, you name yourself, and are given a role to follow, which can range from mafia all the way to a werewolf. You just follow your role and kill/lynch everyone else that's not on your side.  Seems simple, right?  Wrong.  Though you know what you are, most of the time, you don't know ANYONE else. Therefore, you can't really trust anyone else. Therefore, not every game is the same. Every time you play, it's a totally different experience. One game, your a Doctor trying to safe people from dying. The next game, your a Mafioso blasting the brains out of everyone.  You can even play with your friends in the same server, although sharing information outside the game completly ruins the fun. The rules of punishment aren't so bad. Basically, don't be a little crybaby when you die. Like I said, all it takes is one person to ruin it for 14 others.  With most of the positives aside, I really only have one issue with this game, and that's the fanbase. Not everyone is bad, but I've played over 500 games of this, and I've seen a lot. Spammers, people who can't spell proper engwish (:P), and, of course, gamethrowers. Though those are only a few reasons, it can really make you not want to play this game sometimes, which sucks.  In conclusion. I'd like to say it's worth the $5, and if your a broke college kid like me, you can even look it up online and play it for free, as long as you don't mind some ads every now and then. If you do buy it here, you have no ads, and the $5 is broken down into their in-game currency (1300 Town Points), which you can use to buy skins for you characters or house, get pets to follow you, or even scrolls, which increase the chance of you getting a certain role, and can be used until you get said role. So, you're not really losing $5 on this deal. Plus, NO ADS. C'mon, dudes.  Well, that about raps this up. If you ever get in a game and have issues, the creators of this game have a Facebook and Twitter account, to which you can message them. They usually respond, too.  Happy Hanging, boys and girls. ;D  P.S. This game is always updating, to which new features are always being added.

"Odds are that you've either already played Assassin's Creed already, or never will so this review seems a bit like an exercise in futility so I'll keep it short.  Assassin's Creed pretty much single-handedly created the open world parkour platformer game that everyone ended up making eventually. The game itself is still decent despite some design issues, such as doing the same repetitive side quests in order to progress the convoluted main story, or being able to beat the game by using a single combat move ad nauseam. Still, Assassin's Creed (both the first game and the series) does a great job of taking you through various historic locations and keeping you engaged as it does. It's a definite recommendation from me.",1
"Warning: most of this is me rambling than a point to point of what is good and bad.  This, in its own right, is a great game. However, what you do need to before purchasing is that there are bugs. The optimization is terrible, the psychics are sometimes weird, sometimes the A.I.s just stop what they're doing, even if you're shooting at them, standing around confused, the controls are lofty (which is sort of good for these sorts of games where you're flying all around with grappling hooks, though this makes it feel like a task to walk from point A to point B), and at times you'll find yourself flung at high speeds while using the grappling hook for no apparent reason. The worst of these problems, I believe, was the optimization (keep in mind this error only happens for a few). When exploring temples, it would get so bad the combat turned into more of a how to predict where the bad guy will be throughout the lagging. But, getting past that, this delivered an experience like none other. This is one of those few games that has created memories for me. I still remember the time I jumped off my airship onto the back of a whale and killed it with a knife, thinking of a way to stop my fall as we fell through the air towards certain death. I had so much whale meat after I carved it out on the side of a done that I was encumberd for so long and didn't know what to do. Or the time I was boarding a huge whaler ship and then a whale came across the fray, so it was madness of bullets flying through the air as it rammed into the side of the ship we were fighting in, sending us flying away, then crashing further below. I was uncertain whether I should use this to my advantage or fight for dear life alongside them to kill the brute. Or even the time I got into a ship and saw the odds were so against me I ran to their engine room to destroy their engines, sending us crashing and scavenged what I could from the wreckage. That's the thing I love about this game: that feeling of falling through the sky, that fight-or-flight response, wondering how the heck to save yourself. I could divide my time into exciting scenarios through and through. Stories are great, but what is the game, you may be asking. Well, you fly around the world with this neat map system with three zones: the below world, which has toxic gas you need to fix your ship and your character up for to counter it, monstrous creatures instead of air ships that I will let you discover for yourself (it might have ships, too, I can't remember), the middle is the normal forestry place, and the sky world above is mostly free some stuff other than a few dunes here and there littered around. Well, maps are great, but what do you really do? The goal is to loot special temples (along with a few other odds and end jobs, though mostly you're left to yourself, which I love). You can get blueprints to be able to craft items and can use your money to buy stuff and train your person in a few traits, such as agility, wisdom, strength, etc. (I’ll let you discover the wondrous perks may do. I am not an expert on that area, anyway). Looting temples really leaves something to be desired, sadly. (The lag I have makes everyone a nightmare, though, yet again, only some have this glitch). They go on forever, it seems, and though you can keep a mindset of, 'get in, get out', I'm a perfectionist so it doesn't feel right to not explore every room. The items and money scattered around are just enough to make it feel like you're missing out. I think that bad guys keep spawning, too, which is annoying. Mostly, I found myself standing around, boredly shooting at turrets until they exploded and then moving on, drilling holes into the ground because I didn't feel like taking any more trash from the spikes. So, why do you have to loot these temples? Well, some are just small plain ones for fun and loot, though there are the special ones that require you to find and kill the boss there and collect the tablet which triggers the trap--the best part of the temples, in my opinion (the walls and floor will start changing, sometimes spikes will start to appear everywhere and bits of the roof will fall down and hurt you or close some paths off (which you can drill through if you want), so you're on a clock to get out of there and hop into your jolly parked ship and bring it to a person who will give you tons of money (unless your ship gets destroyed by an enemy and you have to improvise. That, again, is what I love about this game. That feeling of just sitting somewhere wondering how you're going to overcome this next obstacle: should I wait for someone to come along and take a ride on their ship (or steal) or make a small ship on the fly? Of course you may be wondering what is ship building and what if you don't want to design ships in the first place? Ships require a few key things, such as generators to keep components powered (if there isn't enough power, components work worse and worse depending how much energy there is to go around, and, if there is none, they will simply stop working), propellers to move the thing around, steering thing, and, optionally, you can also add balloons to make them float better, along with guns to defend yourself. There are also a few other odds and ends, I believe, not to mention the bits purely for decor. The great part is, you really don't have to make your own ships from scratch. You start with one, so you can either keep adding stuff to it or steal someone else's and so on. It's a great mechanic because you can do as much or little as you want with your ship. The air battles are fantastic. You can crash into ships, shoot them, or my personal favorite of boarding and killing everyone, claiming the boat for your own or scavenging their parts for your own creations (at the dock, you can save ships there so you never have to worry about it being lost, broken or boarding another ship on the fly when you register it at the dock. Also, the repair system is super nice. An outline of the ship always remains even when it's shot off, so you can simply highlight it with said tool and it gets repaired to the original design instead of you having to guess what went where). I think this game is really more about the heart than mechanics. If you're going to judge it simply because it's a game--well, it has problems. But if you're like me and look upon it like a door to a crazy adventure, step right in.  If you have decided purchase this game, my parting bit of advice to you is to look beyond the shell and instead to the heart of it--and save. I always get this tingly feeling like something crazy is about to happen so I save it--like that whale part--so I can keep reliving that one absurd scenario over and over.",1
"Let me first say... Superhot does just about everything right, fun gameplay, great mechanices, sound, graphics, just about everything about it is great...  BUT...  2 Hours. TWO HOURS! Thats all. Yep, the whole story. I got another hour or so with the challenges, but even the challenges are just 'play the game again, but without this or this or that.'   25 dollars is an insane price to be asking for 2.5 hours of a game. So, buy it when its 5 bucks, but spare yourself the regret for now...",-1
"There's something about working together against an overpowering and ruthless enemy. Once you overcome and win, the euphoria is well earned. The AI will not make is easy. If you grow complacent or cocky you WILL lose.  'Don't make the AIs fear you.' 'They kill what they fear.'",1
"Without resorting to superlatives, every single thing about this game is absolutely insufferable.",1
do i have to pay in order to play for it now? although it put free......,1
"Such a fun and cute game!  The way the game works with the story of trying to become king/queen of Armello is great! It truly has a royal theme to it and I enjoy it a lot!  The graphics are just stunning, along with the characters who are all just dangerously adorable while you're ...murdering them. Oops.  P.S - i usually play as River or Elyssia, so if you ever see 'citrissia' playing as either of them, ...brace yourself.",1
"Good fun You have your super-try-hard MOBAS Your 'omfg such bs' FPS Your Invest-Your-Life MMORPGS And all these games.. In reality what was gaming meant for, fun. this is what postal is, its got a modding community and its just fun to mess around in. Overall its not a very high quality game but then again, its not meant to be. I'd defininetly reccomend it to anyone wanting to get a game purely for its fun factor. If you're looking for anything more you aren't going to find it here, I can tell you that. The game itself is really violent and not for the feint of heart, or easily offended.... So go ahead play it if you want a game to just sit back relax and enjoy like gaming was meant for.  Quinn ♥~~",1
really good game. I used to stay up till 4 and play this game when I was 13. Still play it sometimes. would recommend.,1
"Whatever you do in this game, do not, I repeat: do NOT, consider binding Isaac ...",1

review update 2016:  never bored playing this game review again because of badge regret nothing  why do i like this game? is because there is so much possibility and unexpected things. then i recommend this game!,1
"Undertale in and of itself is a journey. At first I was incredibly skeptical of it because I wasn't quite sure of what the game was or how it worked. But once I started playing, I became immediately invested in the story and the characters.   As many of you know, there are different endings and different ways to play. I'm playing the 'pacifist' route, not because of the ending I want to receive, but because I truly don't want to hurt anyone. Characters in the game feel like more than just pixels, and even the little 'grunts' that you fight have little quirks (hugs, flirting, and teasing, oh my!). The fact that you don't have to fight is fascinating to me. You can act. You can have mercy. I have never seen that before in a game.  Another awesome thing about Undertale is its soundtrack and humor. The soundtrack is wonderful to listen to (makes me wish I got the game AND the soundtrack deal.....), and not truly a headache to listen to. The dialogues between characters, or even the observations the player character can make, are amusing too. I especially loved Sans and Papyrus. Because, dude.  It's hard to tell people what to expect from the game because everyone takes out something different when they play. I thought it was fantastic and interesting. Were there some issues? Yeah, but not with the actual game. I got frustrated a lot during big fights because I died quite a bit. Sometimes I made the wrong choice and smacked myself for it (Toriel.....). But that's what makes Undertale wonderful. It's unpredictable and endearing.  So yeah. Play it. It's chill. :)  Except Flowey. Screw him.",1
My reaction to this is it's meh. I'd pick it up if you just wanted a cheap game to play around with for a little.   Pros + Cheap + Decent music  Cons - The jumping is really frustrating - I noticed stuttering a few times - The second you press escape all progress is lost,1
It´s ♥♥♥♥ing great. Teamwork. Skill. Fun.   It´s the best 30 bucks I´ve spent lately!,1
"If you like star wars buy this game. It may be old but so much replay potential and amazing story, i promise you wont regret it.",1
"Super fun game, hours and hours of crazies!",1
Still better storytelling than Watch Dogs  10/10,1
"Nyan.  Cats and breasts.  If you're not into that, there's an actual story. Like, it's not a 'Do I say 'YO!' or 'Hello, nice to meet you.' kind of visual novel. It's what a visual novel should be by looking at the words 'Visual' and 'Novel'. As in, a novel with visual aids to help in the immersion and overall feeling of the story. It's pretty fun if you see it like that. And just like any good book, it'll borrow 3-7 hours of your time that won't be regretted.  Do I want more people to buy this VN?  Yes.  Should you buy this VN?  I dunno, it's not free, and I sure as hell ain't in your shoes to decide what you should and shouldn't buy without considering the possibilities and outcomes of siblings, organ issues, family issues, love life, taste in chocolate, and many other things that construct your personality and nature throughout life.  If you came into my house demanding a refund, would I be furious and confused?  Absolutely.",1
"I very much enjoyed season 2, as much as season 1. SCORE 90/100.  I do appreciate letting Clementine do and see the world more as it is, which isn't pretty, She is coming into her own quickly.  I do wish it was longer but the plot, action, characters, and variety are as good as the TV show.  At this point, I would probably buy any TellTale point &amp; click adventure set in any universe.",1
"are you ready for a game more difficult and hardcore than Dark Souls? embark on a quest to save the dark and ancient kingdom of the sea, fight difficult enemies and bosses and die over and over again. if you finish the game you are one of the few and you should be proud. play the game at your own risk: heartattacks, braindamage, suicidal thoughts.",1
"My friend gave me a steam key after he got the collector's edition. I wasn't sure what was the big deal until I played it. A mix of Hotline Miami, Binding of Issac, and mutants really sums up this game. One of the best indie games I've played in a while.",1
Fantastic piece of art,1

"Great story, and a unique atmosphere. A little short, but still a great game",1
"They fixed it, its great :)",1
Oh my goodness! This game has moved my whole life. I have chosen my career and motives towards engineering BECAUSE of THIS game. I have never been so satisfied with a game in my whole lifetime. It not only teaches how Astrophysics work but gives you the room for creativity and fun!,1
"Just dont, ok. Just dont do it soldier... I'd better be back in 'nam in 1968 than play this misserable game...",-1
"This VN is one with no choices, however the feels it gave were like no other. It really is worth 20 bucks because the quality and story are just beyond amazing",1
"Terrible Steam integration. Ridiculous EULA. Requires a joystick just to really be playable. Multiple key activation is a complete hassle. It essentially doesn't matter what game comes after all the nonsense, as this behaviour and execution is awful. You know what they say about first impressions. And this one stinks.  Since it was a gift I'll be playing it to some extent anyway, and here's hoping what comes after the initial offense is less offensive.  If you're considering purchasing this: don't.",-1

"Not bad FPS, especially the F2P aspect of it: 7/10  PROS: +Graphics are pretty, it's the cry engine and even on the lowest(laughable but usable) settings, you can see well +Runs well, at least it does when it isn't connected for me +Strong playerbase, some are rude, but over all less toxic than CS:GO +Good guns, stock weapons aren't bad...if you know how to use them... +/-Store isn't a good thing...neither is it a bad thing, but guns being $2,500 a day and earning money at a $100 per match makes the grind really tiresome, especially if others have those high powered guns +Good guy Devs +It's free +Not as much download needed as TF2  CONS: -Store, you don't need to use real money(if you want to) but you'll be shotted by people with those store bought buns alot, some are OP -Runs good, just not on my system :( -Download of a launcher... -...and making of an account... -...to wait around 2 hours to finally play... -... and getting kicked from 17 matches without evening being in-game   Overall verdict: 6-7/10 - it runs badly some times for me, but it's just me, I wish I had bots, and then it would be a 8/10 - Still fun",1
"Very fun game until halfway through, it then gets quiet repetitive. Still worth a play.",1
Good Solid game that is fairly unique and does what its meant to do well.       P.S its pretty hard to get the hang of,1
Good game i like this game,1
I've played this game so many times to completion and every time there is still something new.,1
"This game is a free for all, Rampage, Full of awesomeness game.  You can join raids even when your level is low..   How awesome is that?  Keep it up",1
"A chilling game in enviroment and though the acting is a tad rushed the main storyline offers a thrill ride through the mind of a estranged boy, but the fear in my opinion comes from the wonder of just who the main protagonist is and why he is going through such horrors. Even after you beat the single player their is a co-op story you can go through, sadly it is co-op in title screen alone as you are unable to connect with anyone which I hope is soon fixed yet I have managed to make it somewhat far on my own, on the plus side you are given a gun that lets you take down a ax wielding maniac in mid charge so you can feel like the bad ♥♥♥ cop you are attempting to be portrayed as. All and all the gameplay is fun and challenging, most importantly it most likely make those with weak constitutions Cry of Fear!",1
Best Roguelike FPS out there right now easily.,1
This game is so worth the $8 I spent even though I have it on the Xbox. It is also worth the $14 if it is not on sale. The DLC is also worth the 99 cents for each and gives a different experience.9.5/10,1
its a great game also if you stand on a dead pig near the back and spam knife you will fly on the pig its actually really fun,1
"Totally wasted all my free time, which isn't much to begin with. 10/10 would buy and play again.",1

"If you don't mind the extremly annoying automated camera that makes you look at everything except the thing you actually want to look at, a handholding tutorial that doesn't even let you read tooltips of buttons if its not the one you're expected to press and useless cut-scenes you can't skip, then X-Com is actually a quite nice tactics game with a deep management and research part between missions. Would have been a very good game if fighting the controls wasn't harder than fighting the aliens.",1
It's like Flow but worse.,-1
"You fly in first person vision trough a tunnel at high speed trying to fit through the holes in upcoming walls  I really like the game mechanic and style, the music is simple and can be muted easy  Sadly the mouse control is somehwat loose, you float around a bit after moving, making it more hard than it should be  Good game for short breaks, obviously a mobile port or intended for mobile devices, buy it cheap!",1
Breathes new life into an old classic!,1
I love dark souls. The end.,1
Pillars of Eternity is a great game for anyone that likes a good rpg with party-based gameplay. This is one of the best games I have played in a while.,1

"So.....scared.....so....dark...omg...........If your not willing to completely get immersed in this game dont even bother. However, if your willing to completely absorb yourself in this game then turn off the lights, crank up the volume, and try not to scream.....",1
"Great story telling with the theater cinematic, the scrolls and the props of certain rooms.   Beautiful art design on all parts of the map, the sound effect and soundtrack are well chosen for all the special moments in the game.   The power-ups moves are cool and responsive with a pad, the game-play is not extremely hard but it can be challenging on some bosses. The majority of the puzzles are fun and fair. Backtracking is possible and easy once you have the appropriate power-up.  Enjoyable from the beginning till the end with a satisfying ending if you   collect all the scrolls.     Buy it!   Do it for the TeslaMom!  ",1
other than the glitch with charging with any charging animal it crashes it is a very fun and intersting game filled with so much fun and joy,1
"Read the reviews, felt a tad let down that as an early adopter of CMS: 2014 there was no incentives given for adopting CMS: 2015 early, however I overcame these feelings and decided to give the game a go.  If you enjoyed 2014, 2015 will not fail to keep you entertained. Only played the classic mode thus far and it's still brilliant. It's nice to get a list of items that you'll need to replace given to you. I also appreciate that far more parts are now removable and will need to be replaced.  I do not recommend this game to anyone that can't appreciate a decent 'mong out' style game. Anyone that found EuroTruck Simulator 2 enjoyable should find this to be a blast. If you couldn't appreciate the simple beauty of that game, this one will lose your interest quickly.",1
"This is a great game and you dont even have to like trains to apriciate the game. I only have two complaints, when I go places I cant play on my macbook or even launch the game, one last thing is that there are not very many american steam locomotives, so if thats what you are looking for then this is not the game you are looking for. I hade to make a compromise and i sugest you do the same the game is great!  Sorry if I made spelling mistakes...",1
Game is still very much in a beta state yet they release it as is and charge for it. It has potential but it's so buggy and unbalanced that you will probably just get mad constantly.,-1

Best game ever been playing it since i was like four. Look at my username ;) happy human hunting comrads.,1
"I love this game its lots of fun. I can play for hours and hours. I would have highly recommended getting this game if there wasn't a downside to this game, it being the DLC. I constantly find that I have to buy the DLC to get access to some of the guns in the game (the coolest ones I might add) and I understand that the need to make money but I sort of feel that they are screwing us over a tad bit. You have to pay more than double the amount of the game for all the DLC. The DLC might annoy me but I don't think it's fair to give this game a negative recommendation. It is very entertaining.",1
"Undertale has a place among the best reviewed games on Steam for a couple of reasons:  - a greatly implemented and highly satisfying fight system  - a morality system which is interesting and has meaning  - a funny, intelligent and tear-jerking story  - an outstanding soundtrack  - a high replay value due to the points above   And please be determined and try to evade any spoilers for this game. Just get it and see for yourself.  Highly recommended.",1
"One of the best RPG's I ever played ! Extremely well crafted world with interesting environments, soundtracks, enemies, quests that dont feel repetetive thanks to the interesting story which is behind every quest. Each character is different and unique and has its own backround and personality. Story is well writen and gameplay wise its fluent, interesting, fun and challenging, totally not like AC series......  Overall Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt is a Bad a-s-s ! and Must have !",1

"This game is a stinking turd. I liked Mass Effect 1 very much, and the developers just had to carefully expand it for the sequel. Instead, they recreated the interface and the gameplay in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dumbed-down fashion that words fail me. I am certain that this is due to console gamers (supposedly?) demanding games that fit into their monkey brains and work with their monkey controllers. For people who liked the first Mass Effect, it is a kick in the groin. Not everything was perfect in part 1, but I cannot name a single thing that improved in part 2. Greatest disappointment of the decade, and I will most certainly not buy part 3 next year.",-1

"This adventure game is ok, not AWESOME. The graphics/story telling in the game are pretty good but the game play is just one click dumbed down for just about anyone. Just click click click and no major brain power required since its just trial and error. The night vs day repetative character (nothing really changes) is also annoying. Same party every night! come on. The ending was nice, long and explained a lot so I can't complain about that part. I would recommend it if you like adventure games but I like the deponia series a bit more.",1

"  It's good, but u can't see the key bindings...  u actually must try it out xD  pls fix thanks mate xD",1
"95 hours played in 5 days.. That should give you some idea how I feel about this game.  Overall I'd give it an 8/10 in its current state. There are a few things that need to be worked on and balanced, but the developers are actively communicating with the player base on sites like Reddit &amp; Twitter in order to come up with some good ideas and ways to fix broken things. The devs are listening &amp; communicating with us &amp; that doesn't happen very often!  The gunplay is awesome. The cover system works great. There have been a lot of people complaining that the AI are boring, however, as someone who has completed dozens of 'Challenging' missions over the last couple days I can tell you that they are anything but. You can fight the same group of mobs 30 times and they will constantly change their tactics based on how you play.  Once they get a few issues worked out (Dark Zone &amp; Phoenix Credit related issues) and we start getting new content (DLC + Expansions are already planned) I imagine I will be upgrading the 8/10 to a 10/10.",1
INFACT this game is amazing the animation on this game is is awesome for a free game i recommend this gae cause its my favorite free game out there so far i dont play alot of free games sept tf2 but this game is it was 20 bucks id still buy it,1
Friendly fire......lots of it. Supports drops can kill you......oh yeah you and your whole team. Limited ammo and supplies to fight untold numbers of foes......understatement of the year. Requires team effort and thinking to play well. . .duh.  Would I trade my left nut and eye for this game. Hell yes. I will trade them twice.  No match is the same twice. You have to think of a ballance when you deploy your support items must be able to deal with anything that could come your way. You cannot do it all so your team must help mainly be not killing each other with friendly fire. Great move devs. Love the friendly fire part of the game with the turrets and the mechs and the exploisions. BOOM says it all. Even the grindy part to unlock and upgrade your gear is lots of fun because it requires effort and its also a good team task so everyone gets the goods.,1

Amazing game. Graphics are appealing and the gameplay is superb. This is a game I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of ARPGs and if you aren't a fan of ARPGs this is a good place to start if you are open to trying one.,1
LOVEEEEE ITTTTTT,1
It's good ♥♥♥♥ buy it,1
What a game! What a lovely game!!!! All Shiny and Chrome riding into Valhalla has never been so satisfying.   Sorry I just had to. If you liked Fury Road you are going to love this game. Combat is exhilarating meaning I had a grin everytime I blown something up. Mad Max is wonderfully optimised I get an average of 80fps at 1440p on a single 970 which is quite an achievement in this day and age considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports we are getting in the past few years. Story is interesting but I will update the review after I complete it. Apart from main missions there are quite a few activities in the wasteland ranging from capturing bases(far cry style but better) to taking down sniper nests and so on but I like the random encounters quite a lot. Their is a dynamic day &amp; night cycle at certain times the game is a sight to be hold. I love this game I literally cannot stop playing this who knew scrap MaX would be so much fun.  10/10 Would Valhalla again!!!,1
"To the Developers absolutely love your game, the only thing I thought that it was missing considering the chosen storyline and genre which is very close to most typical JRPGs is the fact that there is no reward or bonus for completing the game and starting again. This is one of the things I typically loved about the 'Tales of the World' series. Something to consider I suppose if you ever plan on making a sequel...",1
what the ♥♥♥♥,1
You have to win the game.,1
"One of the best arcade Rogue Like games i've played, and I am not usually into these types of games. Very easy to get into, nice soundtrack, good RNG weapon and shield drops so every single run will be different from the last. Nice variation of maps, enemies and bosses. While it is repetitive, you do not get tired of it because of that 1% chance that you will get good gear in the next run. Very nice and simple upgrade system. The only thing that is missing is Multiplayer support for the game. 9.5/10",1
5 out of 5 stars! I loved this game I spent 15 hours just rushing through the story mode.,1
I like the story of 4 guys who can't buy a working drill.,1
Its good honestly but i think it should have a workshop but i definitely recommend it,1
Works fantastic with my Voodoo 3 (16mb) card!! I'd ditch those Titan cards and get a Voodoo....marvelous.,1
"A fun Thief-alike that should really be called 'Dishonoured' since it's set in what appears to be steampunk Victorian England. Think Thief if it was set a couple hundred years later. The storyline is full of more AAA video game cliches than I thought possible, but the gameplay is a lot of fun. The powers you unlock as you play make the game too easy, even on the highest difficulty level, but there's something to be said for being an unstoppable demigod sometimes. Plus you can just play without them if you really want to feel like you're hardcore or something.",1
"Built my prison, got over 150 inmates. Next thing I know, my power generator exploded, a water pipe burst, and the mayor wanted me to remove all TVs from my prison. I sent in some firefighters but they burned up in the fire. RIP fireman",1
"A unique and fitting art style for an equally creepy and chilling game. A true diamond in the rough. If you ever get your grubby hands on it, give it a try!  Or if survival isn't really your thing, do what I do, use the console to spawn 20 Deerclops while putting running speed on max and see how long you survive.",1
"Amazing game, sountrack as well. A bit on the short side if you want gameplay- 4 hours to beat. It has the new game+ feature though.",1
"This game is one of the best games I have ever played since the gameplay is great, the controlls are very simple, and the dialogue is amazing, and so are the sound tracks. The only two problems I can personaly see in the game is that in the beginning of the game they don't really explain the FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, and MERCY options making alot of the players accidently go for the Genicide or Neutral endings. The only other problem I see is that there is no way to get your HP any higher then 20 (this is the HP that you start with) if your trying to get the the Pacifist ending just making it that much harder to get the Pacifist ending.",1
"0/10 horrible graphics, bad music, disgusting textures.  The ponies aren't even cute.",1
"The game is so simple and yet so difficult at the same time. It might not feel difficult in the beginning, but it definitely will when you get past a few of the first levels. Overall opinion: awesome 8.5/10. ",1
If you think this game is scary you are a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥.,-1
THIS IS SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!,1
 Good but...,1
"Amazing game, been playing since 2013 on console, Free dlc's keep the vibe going but are getting progressively expensive, but overall this open world game is amazing but on pc specifically the glitches and modders are ridiculous, hopefully the servers get better fixed and add a easier report system. But when you are in session with many friends the fun is endless.",1
this game is rilly good and cool ,1
"I've played hundreds of games in my 24 years of gaming. This is one of the few titles that make my life as a gamer worth it. I'm far from finishing the title but the atmosphere of this game has pulled me in so far that i want to savor every moment. The graphics are absolutely amazing! I feel as if this game truly takes me to a time that should exist for everyone. A true fight for survival in this universe that we can never predict. One alien... is exactly how it should be. A thousand more could never match the fear of the one that lurks my nightmares. I feel the alien, and i feel the isolation in every step of this game!",1
i think this is the best RTS that i've played a beter name for the game how to nuke your opponent,1
"As a former Diablo 3 player (and still play casually), I hate to admit it, but Path of Exile exceeds almost everything that Diablo 3 has in terms of gameplay.   In an ARPG, customization is a huge part of the game and PoE has a gigantic skill tree for you to build whatever character you want. Whether your character ends up a success or a total fail, it really doesn't matter, because that's part of the fun and a great way to learn the game's many mechanics. Another thing that I really enjoy about this game is the 4-month seasons that bring new ways to experience the game from new enemies and affixes or buffs. It really makes the game stay fresh and you can't help but keep coming back for more. On top of that, this game updates very frequently and it's hard to believe this thing is completely free and no pay-to-win at all.  There are so much more to the game that I don't want to go into great detail about; otherwise it would end up being an essay. But if you're looking for great ARPG, seriously look no further, this game is the pinnacle of the genre and will continue to be for a very long time.",1
Awful. Just awful. +Like combination of two games +Looks pretty exciting -Bad graphics -Unbalanced teams -Quite a few hackers -P2W -Things are very expensive to buy -A shovel and a tank costs the same -Unrealistic. Like soldiers go to the battlefield with a bycycle and soviets fight the allied powers :/ -Takes A LOT of time to level up. -Bad plane controls -Bad hud -Bad maps Just spare your 1.1GB and download something else ,-1
"I did not recieve my 10,000 points for the total of winnings predicted WTF",1
"This game can become very VERY addicting if spent with friends on servers, really enjoyable and a good price in the summer sale :D",1
"Fun shmup! The light effects are cool, and the music effects (slow-down when using time special, drums cutting out when you die) are awesome. I wish there was a better indicator of when you bullets hit things (like the minibosses).  Also don't recommend playing with a touchpad lol, game is difficult enough.",1
Great game to play with friends,1
u play this game? hmmm.... maybe u will be otaku,1
"Very strange experience, It's short but it builds up a nice horror-like atmosphere.",1
"Fantastic game. Story is top notch and 100% one of a kind. You won't experience anything like this in another game. The message is powerful and to the point but doesn't come off as preachy. The plot twists are well executed.  Solid third person shooter mechanics, cover is available but not required. The controls are a little bit finicky, but ok to work with. I finished the game on the hardest available starting difficulty, and while it offered a challenge I wasn't completely losing my ♥♥♥♥ at the game.  Definitely worth your money. I won't forget this game anytime soon.",1
"not even close to HD, gameplay is pretty bad and just uses the keyboard as a console controler",-1
 Introduction,-1
This is an amazing game with great story that haven't aged a day! :D,1
Best and most goreful villain simulator ever. Also nude and sex scenes for forever virgins like me.,1
"It's a one button stratigy game, more difficult than the impossible game. Love it",1
It's cars with rocket boost and a big a$$ soccer ball. What doesn't seem fun about it!,1
"Gateways initially seems like an 8-bit Portal platformer, but it grows to be so much more.  The story sorrounds a professor who has been trapped in his lab. He explores it, and in doing so recovers parts of his equipment, which lets him progress further. The initial gun fires simple point-to-point gateways, like Portal. But as more guns are unlocked, the game becomes more and more challenging and interesting, with Time travel gates, gravity reversal gates and so on.  The game doesn't take very long to complete, and I was able to solve the game first time without using any of the hints, but it still proves to be challenging enough in certain areas.  This game can be controlled by a controller, but I would reccomend against this, as using analog sticks it can be hard to accurately place the gates. Keyboard and mouse work much better.  The 8-bit graphics in this game are very nice. The map never looks particularly 'static' in any way, with minor details   The music in this game is very nice. It's never too obtrusive and loud, and definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game.  There is a level editor (library&gt;tools), and workshop integration so you can create and share your own maps. The level editor is easy to get a hang of, and the developers included an extra map which is available on the workshop.  I found no bugs while playing this game, and it never crashed on me. My only complaints are that the save points are a bit sparse, though. So if you die, you might have a long way to travel to get back.  Overall this is a great little platformer puzzle game, it's a bit short, but definitely worth playing.",1
"It is fun, but its way toooooo short. Did i miss something. I only need 30 Minutes. Then this good mode. No value there. Or i miss something, beside looking closer to the different mountains. BUT. One + side. I really liked this flying over the mountains sceens with the commentary (also too short). They should put more of those in it. Please put more 'fly over' in. Or more content. Even more commentary about the Everest. Im sure there is a lot of interesting stuff.  In General. I can't recommend this Experience (its not a Game). You can't ask for the same price as RAW Data or similar quality games for this.....",-1
Insurgency is an amazing game with a mixture of Arma 2 and Counter Strike gameplay creating a faster paced intense realistic first person shooter. 9/10,1
Loadout was a pretty good third person shooter. Me and my friend played it for a bit and I had had all of my guns as healing guns so I never really did get high scores.,1
fun with friends .. you feel the power when you play the monster ...i love playing the monster,1
"I'll start by saying that I'm surprised I played the game to the end.  Normally I'm not the adventure game type, and considering there isn't a huge amount of variety in the tasks required (nearly everything is a 'find X of Y' hunt), the world as a whole is actually very well rounded and detailed both graphically and with optional flavor text and dialog. The characters are well personified with minimal (absolutely minimal) but well done voice acting.  It is also short, and I manged to beat it in ~3 hours. There is a choice to be made at a pivotal point in the story so I might actually go back and try to take another path. Plus there might be some things that subtly change the ending dialogs. I almost certainly missed some side quests/characterization too. For a relatively short game they managed to pack in quite a bit of content.  The story is simple but serves the purpose well, as does the crude level-up stats system. This is not an RPG to the extent that you need to consider min-maxing the few stats you have, and they seem to have minimal impact on gameplay. There are no dialog trees, but the dialog is at least partially context aware: If you encounter a character before you were meant to, often that encounter will be acknowledged during the dialog with other characters (eg: 'Oh, I met (character) earlier...') which adds a nice bit of immersion.  The flower picking mechanic (flowers basically being used as a form of currency) is a bit tedious, and picking enough to get all of the extra items (keys, mostly) to unlock all of the optional doors and collect trinkets/flavor text is a daunting task. There is an achievement for picking 1000 flowers and boy howdy do I believe that could happen...  There's also an achievement for breaking 1000 pots - you basically walk into people's houses and break their pots for money Legend-of-Zelda style. That number seems to be a lie, though; The achievement counter advanced by 5 for every 2-3 pots broken, so I suspect the *real* number is 500. Still a lot though.  There is no health/death mechanic, and the consequence for failure is being teleported a small distance away.  The semi-optional mini game where you cling to the back of the 'enemies' and pick flowers out of their heads is fun at first but gets annoyingly difficult. It is only required a handful of times, fortunately, and the reward for completing extras is merely extra masks that your character can wear.  The map consists of six areas - one of which is a single room you only deal with for an optional side quest - four of which are 99% of the game. These areas are fairly good sized, richly detailed, beautifully rendered but labyrinthine townscapes in which you meet the characters, collect the trinkets and find the switches which are the meat of the gameplay. The design and styling gives each area a very organic and 'lived in' feel despite the cartoonish colors and proportions. It won't dazzle you with blooms and particle effects but it is very pretty. The mechanic by which you move from one 'quarter' to the next is *nearly* seamless, with just a slight hiccup as you transition through an airlock-esque connecting area.  There is an abundance of invisible walls which gets a little annoying at times.  The protagonist character, which you play as, is notably not an annoying brat, moody or woefully inept. That wouldn't normally be something to mention... maybe I just have far to cynical a view of modern adventure games.  Finally, there is no foul language, sexually suggestive themes/dialog (not even a passing euphemism!) or meaningful violence - all 'fighting' is the previously mentioned minigame where you sneak up on enemies and pluck flowers out of their head.  Overall a great game and I'd recommend it.",1
" A powerful journey into man's consciousness.   SOMA might not be the most terrifying horror game made by Frictional Games, and it isn't the most original one in terms of gameplay, physics mechanics and riddles. But the story itself is enough to make this game great. Totally recommended to sci-fi lovers.",1
"Dear developers of this game, you had one job: Make an RTS, not company of heroes...",-1
"I bought this game on 360 and said to myself, 'why the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ did i buy this?', and decided i'd at least get it on sale to give it another chance..then realized there is no gamepad (controller) compatibility whatsoever..Which made me think, 'but...it was a console game too..so why no controller?'

"The first Two Worlds is arguably an abomination, surely it had a decent sized open world, a huge range of equipment and online to boot, it was executed badly and i really mean badly, it's one of the glitchiest rpg's...no, games of this generation.  People were horrified to hear that there was a sequel to this foul game, so much that they thought it was laughable that it even got a sequel in the first place as well as the running joke of 'two worlds two' but in fact, a sequel was just what this game needed.  Although it was supposed to be an expansion to the first two worlds, reality pump and topware clearly saw that the first game wasn't well received and decided to improve upon it rather than adding on to it. As a result they decided to make a sequal...though it does seem to be a remaster of the original two worlds with the main villian of the first game returning in which you clearly beat him (ganondorf much?), that is if you picked the good choice. It's easy to say that this game is a lot more engaging than the first and you can see that they really worked hard on this game. The graphics for starters are pretty good, something you wouldn't expect to see after the abomination that was the first game, you can clearly see an improvement. Unfortunately this can make the game pretty unstable at times with plenty of lag issues (especially if you're playing a mage character).  The game opens up in Castle Vahkmaar where you have been taken prisoner by the evil emperor, Gandohar (what a step up eh?) and you have to escape the prison where you end up on this small island and meet a prophet as well as a band of orcs, afterwards you are free to explore the open world...well not exactly everywhere. You unlock new areas as you progress through the main quest which may be off putting to some. One of the games strong points is it's questing. Unlike most wrpg's Questing doesn't always feel like a tedious affair, sure there aren't as many quests as most wrpg's such as elder scrolls but there are a lot less 'filler' quests, most of the mundane ones being buliten board quests. Quests in Two Worlds 2 feel more interactive than most, though the main game gives you very little options in choice, there are often multiple paths/choices that you can take in side missions and many of them are engaging if only for the bizarre sense of humor in them and their creativity. Some quests may seem plain and simple at first however there are many twists and turns which may take you for surprise or they're just plain funny. Some quests can be pretty mundane but there aren't that many of them, thank god (seriously if you're going to add side quests at least make them interesting).  The main story itself is pretty standard fare for most wrpg's, don't expect anything amazing. Two Worlds 2 can catch some players off guard though as it's storyline does have a few twists and they are well explained. put simply, do not play this game for it's plot. The main story does have some interesting moments and scenes however, just don't think about the plot much and enjoy your time in antaloor, pay the story no attention.  The game play has improved from the first game and is similar to that of Diablo 3 but far superior (expect something Diablo esque with the game play) every element of game play feels reminiscent to Diablo, heck i even made some spells from the original Diablo in two worlds 2 such as immolation and nova as well as mana shield. Expect a lot of potion drinking and keep well stocked. Unlike Diablo however, this game is more open world style and isn't top down, so if you want a more modernized rpg with a Diablo like combat system, you've found it (heck even the health orb is reminiscent to Diablo). There are three different classes, melee archery and magic (Diablo much) and you are able to become a hybrid of these three classes should you choose to. Each class has their own set of skills available which you can learn in any order you please but before you can begin leveling up your character's skills you need to buy skill books to learn the skills initially (formerly learned from trainers in the first game) in order to use them and to level them up.  Melee learn skills which can assist them in staggering the opponent and breaking guards, they can also deal extra damage, one move in particular allows you to deal considerable damage to an enemy but is only useful against an enemy who is left open to attack as is is easily blocked and hard to connect with. Using these skills also allows you to interrupt enemy attacks so you should use them wisely  Ranged learn skills which can alter their elemental attributes and affect the speed and damage, most ranged skills are passive. There is a sniper mode however it is badly implemented which makes it useful only to pick off foes who haven't noticed you yet which is useless in many of the games dungeons due to their lack of space.  There is also a 'sneak' class however sneaking isn't effective enough to be considered a class of it's own, sneaking doesn't seem to work well in this game and it is simply easier to not bother with it.  Mages are arguably the most diverse class as Two Worlds 2 allows the player to customize their own spells to create new ones using spell cards which give mages devastating effects. This is one of the games strong points as it allows you to experiment and be creative which is always good. the only problem is that their strength is limited, very much like in Diablo, unlike melee classes which become stronger and deal more damage with strength, mages do not get stronger with willpower as it merely gives you more mana and grants access to higher level mage skills, this is rather disappointing and in the later half of the game you will usually end up using ricochet spells simply because they are the best spells available and deal the most damage just so the mage can keep up with the other classes.  The melee class is arguably the strongest in terms of base damage but they are required to use potions often, however the mage is a lot more versatile and can take out enemies at a greater range and it's spells can hit multiple targets making it somewhat more deadlier than melee. Ranged isn't really much different from melee other than it is long range. On paper ranged are the best choice of class but they most certainly aren't as they lack the complexity of that of mages and they don't have enough skills to balance with the other classes, unless you are best on being a ranged character i would strongly recommend against it as you will find the other two classes far more interesting.  In terms of inventory and equipment, Two Worlds 2 feels a lot less diverse than the original which is disappointing, you will likely be stuck with the same armor you start with for a very long time and will be unable to upgrade until later. However the inventory system has made several improvements, items are a lot more clearer now on the screen and it is easier to organize, one of the few gripes i have about it though is that when you equip an item, it just shows a highlight marker so if you're not careful, you could accidentally sell it to a merchant. There is a new crafting system to replace the combine system from the first game making it far more balanced and you are able to dismantle items and save their parts for later to upgrade other equipment. There are also gems which you can socket into your gear to give them added effects, you can also combine them to make higher level gems using the fusion skill. You can also colour your own equipment using pigments to give your equipment the colour you desire, though not every equipment can be colored.

"A stylish game in music, visuals, gameplay, writing, story and it's entire concept.

Long War is a must. With it XCOM becomes a stellar game,1
"Negative: 1. you must collect points to open the next set of stages, which forces you to play the same map over and over again. i dont remember having that in all the previous 3 parts of carma. 2. cars not balanced and feel generic, for example the red car always been heavy and had a really long turn radius. 3. when you totaled your car you can still fix it like nothing happened. Easy mode? 4. no traffic. 5. the new game modes extremely boring. i remember enjoying time trials in the previous carma games very much, so what happened with that? 6. cell shading on barrels is unnecessary. 7. encountered bad level design on the small map when underwater. 8. CONSTANT CRASHES ON RELEASE ARE NOT ACCAPTABLE! 9. No special missions. i PASSED 3 SETS of STAGES AND ALL I COULD FIND are those silly new regimes. 10. Overall dissapointment realizing that this 'game' has nothing to do with the reall carma! 11. No tech support whatsoever. mails ignored, forums ignored. 12. Past the middle of the game and already bored to death with the repetative missions... Positive: i couldnt think of anything. The graphics is avarage. Everything is avarage.",-1
"Feels like a stripped down rpg shooter.  If this game had a hot bar it would only need the [1],[2][3] keys... for [first] [secondary] &amp; [explosives].  Why bring out an online game after beta testing, if you're never ever going to even try to fix connectivity issues that have presented themselves same old ubisoft.  Started thinking to myself if i want to get my money back I cant go over the 2hr limit &amp; rather then wait months for servers to appear or connectivity to be fixed i got a refund. Maybe months down the track if people are still playing that is &amp; theres way more content and it works properly in Aus, ill pick it up again. ",-1

"I've been playing the game since launch, and have stuck around since. While the road to this point has been rocky to say the least, but the game has seen massive improvements since. I've played plenty of MMOs, mainly WoW, but I've played GW2, ESO, and a few others. I'll split the rest of this review into sections.  Combat:  The combat system for this game is telegraph based. Essentially every ability has a telegraph similar to classic AoE abilities in other MMOs. Most abilities have a cap of enemies/allies they can hit listed on the tooltip, including healing abilities. Enemy mechanics also rely of mainly telegraphics. While not all damage is avoidable in every fight, DPS tend to take little to no damage if they avoid the telegraphs in a majority of fights. Telegraphs are also part of PVP. Combat-CC is a major mechanic of many boss fights and world encounters. If you hate tab targeting, this game may be worth a look. PVP: PVP as a whole tends to have balancing issues. Many of the tank classes cannot be killed, healers are essential to winning matches, and DPS should know their roles. There are 3 Standard PVP maps (1 CTF, 1 Sabotage, 1 Point based), arenas, and Warplots. Warplots are essentially raid-based PVP, similar to old AV on WoW, however, it tends to be difficult to find a group for this without a premade group and scheduled time being planned. Arenas are fairly dead at the moment. BGs are sporadic. Raiding: The raiding in this game tends to be the biggest strength. There are 2 raids, each with interesting mechanics that require the group to be awake, unlike say, WoW's LFR. The raids tend to be rather difficult, especially at lower item levels. The raids do require heavy coordination, mainly in Datascape. For this reason, Pugs tend to be rare for Datascape, and pugs for Genetic Archives do happen, but likely don't full clear. Generally speaking, you need to join a raid guild for raiding. One minor issue (or benefit depending who you talk to) is the lack of guides for raiding, especially Datascape. There are a few good guides floating around, but no where near as many strategies as WoW's community may have. There is a 3rd raid in the game that is a single boss raid, but it tends to rarely be done due to lack of adequate loot.  Non-Raid PVE content: There are 4 types of PVE content: Open world, Dungeons, Adventures, and Expeditions. Dungeons tend to be run to gear up for raids, as well as prepare you for raiding. Adventures are easier minidungeons that have very little purpose aside from cosmetics. Expeditions are solo content that can scale for up to 5 people, and tend to be interesting casual content. Open world offers a few daily hubs which offer things to alleviate some of the Pre-Raid preparations if grinded. Arcterra provides gear better than dungeons, and tends to be the most efficient way to gear if you can't get a dungeon group. Housing: Probably one of the better bits of content in the game. This housing system provides more flexibility than SWTOR's system, while having a simple enough UI so that anyone can build a masterpiece. The Roleplaying community in particular takes advantage of this system, and has made some pretty amazing stuff. Housing provides a very good variety of content at endgame, and increases relevance of some older content. RP: The roleplaying scene is pretty good on both factions. Exiles have a higher population, but the Dominion community still goes on very strong. For more information, I'd recommend checking out the Wildstar Roleplay Enjin site. Population: The game's biggest weakness at the time of writing. Queues tend to be rather slow, especially for PVP content. Many of the daily hubs are barren. Keep in mind, this review was written the day of the steam launch, and will likely get better with time. It's also worth noting I am a Dominion main, and the Dominion has a smaller population than Exile. At the time of writing queues are faction locked, but the devs are working on a system to merge the factions for PVE content. Bugs: The game tends to suffer from a lot of bugs as well. All the bugs tend to be fixed within a months time, but a couple of them take a tad longer to get fixed. It's overall not too huge of a problem if you play other MMOs. Cash Shop: Cash shop isn't too intrusive. The only thing most people tend to be salty about is the service tokens. Otherwise, the store is rather empty at present. A decent chunk of items are on the store, all of which are cosmetic or boosts. Service tokens are your average 'Speed Up' currency which can be used to reset transport cooldowns, take instant flight paths, and make runecrafting (similar to gems in WoW) easier. You earn a currency 'omnibits' while playing which can be used to buy most items on the store. Some items in my opinion tend to be a little pricey, but that is a pure personal preference. The subscription for this game is not required in any way, but tends to give very nice boosts. Costume System: You can wear any armor any time for cosmetic purposes, and can purchase up to 14 costume slots, with redying. Weapons cannot be redyed. Weapons are the only thing class restricted costume wise. There is a way to decustomize your character in game for gold or service tokens. Closing:  This game is certainly worth a try, if you like MMOs. Since it's free to play and doesn't have any 'fee-to-pay' elements to it, I would advise getting to 50, trying out the content, and making your own decisions from there. Hope this helps. ",1
This is one of da best games I've ever played to be honest..,1
Feel like a heroic Space Marine from the 41st millennium.,1
"Was it worth the wait? Yes. Is it optimized? Yes. Are the controls nice? Somewhat.  Grand Theft Auto V is greatly optimized. I currently have a GTX 660 and an AMD FX-4300 at 3.8 GHz. I can play the game at high settings 1080p at 60 fps. That's how good it is. I have yet to figure out Self Radio, but I will figure that out tomorrow.  There were slight multiplayer issues at launch, but that's to be expected. After about an hour they were quickly solved and I had no issues afterwards. All in all, a very solid launch. Much better than the 360/PS3 launch, and the PS4/XB1 launch. I played about 3 hours with my friends on multiplayer, doing impromptu races and exploring all the new graphics settings and new items. It was incredibly fun. We have yet to do heists, but I cannot wait!  If you liked Grand Theft Auto V on the previous or next gen consoles, I highly recommend the PC version, the ultimate version.",1
"It helped me to get through huge anxiety relapse. What more can I say? Playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 is like a good portion of meditation for those who, for whatever reasons, don't want or can't engage into it any other way. Yeah, when you keep staring at that... thing, it may look like a serious problem to overanalyze for the fifth day straight but why even bother now when Lille waits for its tires? Your fancy little personal swamp will still be there when you finish the job, won't it? Just sit comfortably, relax and driiiiiiiiiiive...",1
Do you like avoiding pink things and/or looking at beetles?,1
"I find this game pretty interesting and fun to play. This game can be pretty addicting at some points, expecially when you first start out. I am surprized how much I liked it since I am pretty new to the series as a whole.",1
"A great take on the ARPG genre, dodging and jumping are such simple things but they add so much to this kind of game, The duel weapon system and destinny card systems also alow for very diverse playstyles. The lack of rougelike level generation is also refreshing although it could limit the replay value in the long term.  Considering this game came as part of a Humble Bundle I am very happy with it, and I would recomend any ARPG fan to check out this bundle before its no longer avalible.  *Bundle is/was avalible at the time of this review being posted*",1
A very good looking FPS platformer but a short game.,1
best game cant wait till it come out for ps4,1
"I seriously cannot overstate this game. It's beautifully made with largely realistic physics and gives the most extreme sense of accomplishment at the conclusion of a successful mission. The community is friendly and wonderfully helpful and supportive, as are the creators of the game themselves who take it upon themselves to frequently interact with their fans and even take suggestions as to what should be in the next update.  This may just be my favorite game of all time. 10/10",1
"Like their previous game ('Reus'), this one is also a hidden gem, that instantly went into MY FAVORITES section. Mix of diplomacy, rpg, adventure, turn based combat (with some twists) and a little bit of other things. Fun, charming, witty and with great replay value.   Update (after a couple of more hours of gameplaying): Yep, a pure and fun gem! :)",1
"-Pros- Nostalgia?  -Cons- Not Widescreen. Unskipable cutscenes. Models change between world and battle.   -Other- Not a turn based combat system like people say it is, sadly was the main reason for purchase.  Never played a FF before this, probably never will again.",-1
Wonderful game with an awesome look and feel. I highly recommend playing this just for the experience and suberb game design.,1
Paid 18$ to get into the ERP server. Got banned from the /xivg/.   Was a good day. Oh yeah the game is fun. F*CK OFF CEBRUZ ITS FUN!,1
"Amount of hours is due to watching on youtube first, if you like games with good puzzle mechanics and an unexpectedly and interesting story you'll really enjoy Poncho! Even then I highly suggest you give it a try because I myself don't really enjoy puzzle platformers and still really liked the mechanics and story.",1
First time playing a rogue like style game and im really loving it. As far as RNG goes i really like how its incorporated in this.  AND GUNS!,1
The story is very short and not engaging. But game is so much fun. I recommend it.,1
"Played a lot of this game before it was on Steam, took a break for a while and started playing agian once I saw it was on Steam. Very good MMORPG Graphics- 9.5/10 Very good anime style graphics. Gameplay-8.5/10 Fun but, some what repetitive but still enjoyable despite that. Storyline-9 Enjoyable has some suprising moments. Music-8.7 Very soothing and enjoyable to listen to. Overall 8.92",1
  Nostalgia can backfire ,-1
I'm supposed to move this week.   This game came out.  Supposed to be packing for the move.  Started playing this.  Probably not moving this week.,1
Omfg this game is so much fun to play with your friends i almost ♥♥♥♥ed myself last time i played it! ,1
I recomend this game. if you have nothing to do it pays to run around as a goat and cause some chaos,1
one of the best ccoprative games i have ever played in my life !!,1
One of the few TPS games i actually like 9/10,1

"This game is the most brutal, difficult zombie FPS I've ever played. I love it. Aside from having no Campaign, it's a masterpiece. If you are a fan of hardcore zombie shooters, I highly recommend this game to anyone who reads this.",1
"Randal's Monday is content with making constant references to video games and pop culture. If that's your shtick then you'll probably enjoy it. Personally, seeing The Big Lebowski edited into a Sonic title screen as a poster in his living room made me groan.  The dialogue, of which there is an abundance, is unenjoyable with constant stabs at comedy that fall flat. It's not that the main character is an amoral creature that makes it unfunny as many things (such as Bojack Horseman) have had a jerk for the main character and kept the audience engaged regardless.  Overall, I couldn't enjoy Randal's Monday. The Point &amp; Click genre is engineered for storytelling and the story they're telling here, at least how they're telling it, is a boring nuisance.   Our site made an unedited preview of the game which you can see here:         YouTube™ Video:  Randal's Monday Quick Play [60FPS]&nbsp;",-1
"First off, this was very close to a yes. Theres a lot i don't like about the game, but mostly my issues are with lazy design decisions/game mechanics and pricing.  The avatar project combined with the timed missions doesn't create the type of game play that i enjoy. I could handle the Avatar project as the storyline and being up against the wall in the campaign, however having that feeling in almost every mission is a bit too mch and feels like a lack of imagination. The RNG feels questionable at times, having missed 3 shots in a row at 88% i can understand peoples frustration. Now all that doesn't kill this game, there will be mods to tailor the gameplay to how you like it. What does kill this game is the price, currently set at $80, a $30-$40 price tag would be more reasonable seeing as how the modders are what will save this game. Good game, but its not worth what they are charging.  Edit: And now 12 hours in i am having a major issues where when taking an action the video lags, severely for like 20-40 seconds. Despite having a new Titan and 2011 chipset in my rig. Def hold off on buying this game if you were looking to pick it up. Just Encountered the constant screen shaking bug from EU, making it unplayable for me. The more i am playing this game the more i am becomming aware the bulk of the budget was spent on marketing.",-1
'This is probably my favourite fighting game in regards to mechanics and lore ever as I've been playing mk since I was five years old but what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brothers has done to mortal kombat. The net code and the massive amount of content that pc will be missing out on is just too much sorry Ed but this is insane.'  This was my original review but since the time I wrote this Nether Realm Studios have really gotten their act together and the PC version has now recieved all the content and patches that the console version has.,1
The best RTS I have ever played. Must play if you are a strategy fan.,1
I got a free copy of this game. I feel ripped off.   Not for anyone. 0/5 stars.,-1
If you like strategy games and scifi this is a must have game. If you are expecting a perfect game right now though probably wait for expansions and modders to fix and add content to the game.,1
"The best Wolfenstein game since 3D. Really fun and the weapons are great. Story is surprisingly good for an FPS, especially one from id. Best Game of 2014.",1
This is a easy to use animator but yet your animations look amazing when your done. Overall it's really good.,1
"fun game, huge world, almost too much to do. does get a little reptitive in the side missions. the story missions are great and unique, there are just not enough of them",1
"great game full of easter eggs that will keep yah laughing. Plus guns, guns and more guns.",1
"Boring Man is a total riot, get blown up into smithereens every time you encounter an enemy. It's really messy, but I recommend Boring Man to any 8-bit enthusiasts out there, as well as fans of shooters!  8/10 Pros: -Whacky experience, although at first I thought it was a really 'hitman' like FPS -Easy to kill enemies Cons: -Warfare is really messy, you can literally lose track of where you're at.",1
Didn't think there would be a game better than Kotor 1! I was wrong. 10/10,1
"This game is nice but serious now, why the ♥♥♥♥ I spend around 40€ to buy a game that doesn't handle right with savegames? Almost each day I've got my stats deleted means I've 4 accounts in this game where my stats are gone. I don't blame the game because it's nice, I blame codemasters. 2/10 my assessment.",1
"Very good.  Vanilla game is not amazing, though the game itself is very unique. There are not hardly any other games like this, and Mount and Blade: Warband articulates what it is trying to conceptualize very well. Though the vanilla game is lacking in some features, it still offers solid and very fun gameplay. With mods is where this game really excells, Propesy of Pendor and Floris / A New Dawn are both very good overhauls and gameplay enhancers. I recomend getting PoP for this game, it is my personal favorite mod. It adds literally hundreads of new armors and weapons along with countless new features and improves the storyline / lore, making the game very hard to put down at times.   I don't like to do scaled to 10 reviews just because I do not play enough games I think to very well know other games to scale in comparison and honestly would be very partisan as I only really enjoy to play one type of game. But I just wanted to drop some positive feedback for a very fun game that I like, if you are in question of getting it - you should not be.",1
"Well, don't get discouraged by the little steep learning curve it has.  You need atmost 60-70 hrs to get hold of the game's basics. After that you can play the game as per your style XD",1
This game used to be good.,-1
very funny game loved the 5-9 hours i spend on this!,1
"Destiny is a really fun game, couldnt stop playing.",1
Really Good Single Player game. Gameplay is like Diablo Series!!!!,1
Who is James anyway? 8/10,1
the soundtrack to this game is pure joy.,1
A very cool experience that presents different choices and dilemmas to the player. The game is very mesmerizing but you'll need to pay close attention to details.,1
Game from MUSTHAVESERIES  Didn't completed already the plot and I've been only on the beggining of the whole thing with 5 hours or so... but it's how it used o be. Fantastic and unique world mixed with great storytelling and this one and only feeling. The whole thing is like watching the movie but with control of actions. Graphics in game looks preety decent but surrounding area is just pure masterpiece. Final Fantasy series always had it and never lose it. You can be used to other part of the series or been in great hate toi fighting system but end to end it's a great game. What makes it worse - it's still a port and it's not using full power of pc.  IMHO 9/10 so far,1

"Just went and played it after many months of giving it a miss due to lack of content. First starting up the game I get a 'tutorial' box saying 'We should never see this message!'. I click to continue to find out the button is inactive. After seeing that, as far as I'm concerned, this is not a 1.0 worthy product, and it is certainly not a 'game'. Can I have my money back, please? You guys are almost as deluded as the guys who made Starforge.  UPDATE: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ have even disabled comments on their update announcements because of all the (understandable) hate they're recieving. This is censorship. Give me my ♥♥♥♥ing money back you scamming ♥♥♥♥♥.",-1
"I did not play much yet but i want to tell you , that you probably won't have much fun if you are playing alone. If you are playing alone it is very difficult even on the easiest difficulty and it is quite redundant but i do recommend you getting this game if you are planing on playing it in a group.  You can join a random Multiplayer session which is okay but those people often rush and you can't enjoy everything you want.  But everything considered it is a nice game of the hack and slay genre. Hope i could help y'all.",1
I had to turn the volume down so my neighbors wouldn't think I was watching hentai . . . or wait . . . what AM I actually doing?,1
"  I got this game for free, I think it's a somewhat cool game not something I would recommend for $20 tho, seems abit much for a game that doesn't have active updates ;/.  I don't think this game should have even been put on steam for that much and being how buggy it is. I also disagree with how fast the health goes down, you don't get much time to even do calls being by the time you get there you only have a tiny bit health left, in that time you would have to get back to the PD and go home to eat/sleep...   I think you guys are in this for the money, and not there to support the community that plays and pays big money to support you guys to make this game better where there are not many good police games out there, sure you got GTA V/IV but even that has it's limits and only the rich people with good computers can run it. yes I could go get a better job but that doesn't mean it would give me the money to go out and buy a computer to play.  what also sucks that there isn't any other AI cops, sure it isn't a big town you live in but you think you would have 1/2 on duty to give that tiny bit support in gun fire, even a multiplayer mod would be good in this game.  I hope you guys will update this game soon and not just make a new one and let this die. good work on making it this far lets hope it gets better in over the years. thanks for reading and I love you all (&lt;3 ;) )",-1
I found that doom was quite habit forming for collectors and trophy finders like myself and also fun to speedrun. I would also recommend doom to casual player who just wan't a shoot em up but for plots i would say not so great i would be happier playing skyrim for plot but i still fell in love with the lore I would rate it a 7/10 another success,1
"When we disregard, and roam as sheep, there'll always be A Wolf Among Us.   The game based on the Eisner Award winning comic series, FABLES, The Wolf Among Us is superbly written and appropriately adapted as a successful prequel. Although player choices, that is often praised for Telltale's The Walking Dead, are minute in this game, its story more than makes up for lack of diversion from the central plot.  The unique characters that are written off of famous Fable/Fairy tale characters hone in on your knowledge of their stories, creating a beautiful dialogue between your memories of character knowledge, and the investigative style of this game.   It's an extremely cinematic game and would only recommend to those who adore story-driven games.  Loved it. 8/10.",1
"Hello, fleshling. You will love this game, or hate it. But that depends on your subjective and partial view of it. FN@F was developed by Scott Cawthon using Clickteam Fusion 2.5 as engine. The controls are fairly simple, you only use your Left Mouse Button and there are only 5 interactive objects (well, 6, but that last one is a small Easter Egg played for laughs). You can't move from your position, and instead only look on your left or on your right. The basic mechanics are fairly simple too: your goal is to survive from 12AM to 6AM each night, avoiding being caught by the suspiciously free-roaming Animatronics. Easy? Well, yes, the first night is easy; after that, the difficulty increases exponentially each night, introducing new enemies and improving their AI, even actively adapting to your survival tactics. And of course, it's not only a matter of using the correct control at the right time: it's a matter of using them with moderation. Yes, because all you do requires power, and your power supply is limited. Very limited. You don't want a blackout occurring on the job.  This is Creepypasta material: NO SPOILERS, but the story is NOT a long one, but hell, when you realize it, good luck sleeping. It may require some maturity and sometimes patience to understand it. Some theories are still open.  One last thing: the game is priced 4.99$. If you think it's too much, you must be in a desperate situation and you have all my sympathy. So, for your information, there actually is a DEMO on Moddb. And it's Free.  However, considering you have internet for reading this, supposedly a home and PC, electricity, water and I hope for you food, then 4.99$ shouldn't be too much for you.",1
One of the greatest games to man kind. Seriously so much fun!!! Multiplayer and single player!!! Sent many hours enjoying such beauty.,1
"  There is one word to describe this game: Outstanding.   Guns of Icarus is one of the best games I have ever played. I like the idea, and I like the execution of the gameplay. No one man can do everything in this game. Teamwork and Cooperation are the most important things in playing Icarus Online. No one person goes at anything alone, and everyone has to rely on each other to get things done. Their customization and class system is just beautiful, and I really wish to see the population of Guns of Icarus Online grow, as well as the stability of the friendly community. Totally worth playing!",1

its good up untill the lonely hearts club quest. then came dig-dug 10/10 original quest names,1
"An excellent game, and GOTY edition is an awesome package. Narrative is of variable quality (looking at you Honest Hearts), but overall is excellent for such a large game.  Heartily recommended",1
A very underappreciated gem. Despite its many bugs (which are now almost entirely fixed) S.T.A.L.K.E.R. can still deliver one of the most atmospheric experiences to date.,1

"This game is so amazing but it keeps crashing and erasing all of my profiles, so I have nothing now!  I do not recommend it, unless it gets fixed.",-1
"Shadow warrior is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time. A mix of first person melee and firearms, upgradeable skills and weaponry, secrets, humour, and hordes of demons to satisfyingly chop into little pieces. What more could you ask for? Certainly if you're after a modern fast-paced first person action game, don't hesitate to give this one a try.",1
"Telltale is probably one of my favourite game companies as of late. For however rocky their history is, The Walking Dead turned them around. Their focus on storytelling, the simple feature of a time limit to how quickly you respond to important dialogue, the fact that your decisions feel like they have consequences... It all makes you feel tense, even in a game with very little focus on action.  The Wolf Among Us takes the lessons learned from that series and tries them out with a new story. It's got an entirely different mood to Walking Dead, which should be obvious but it bears mentioning, with a focus on world-weariness played against surreal magic. Bigby Wolf could be a character out of a Detective Noir film, but he doesn't seem out of place talking to a rather chatty and intelligent porcine friend who just so happened to drop in on him unannounced. Much more combat than in the prior series by Telltale but, honestly, it fits the mood; it's never violence for its own sake but, rather, does what any good piece of the set should do: Informs us of the characters and the story.  The Wolf Among Us, Episode 1, is as tight as an elevator cable and feels just as sturdy. The only downside is that on one - and only one - occasion I found a But Thou Must moment, but it was so minor and the scene that followed so thoroughly enjoyable that I find myself annoyed by it more because it felt like the only blemish on an otherwise outstanding work.  Eagerly awaiting Episode 2 with a hunger. Hungry like a wolf.  I don't smell like a sound, though.",1
People that dont like this gam do not have taste for a very solid and simple Beutiful remake of an epic rts.,1
"In knock knock you will have to learn how to play hide &amp; seek again, but in this case you will learn the rules from your mistakes by paying a small amount of time.   ^ Pros ^  - Visually awesome.  As many indie games, the artwork in this game is great.  - Weirdly fun protagonist.  His voice, the place where he lives... great.  - Random generated scenarios.  Even with that, the game ends feeling kinda repetitive because of the games mechanics.  - Weird but deep storyline.  The story line can have some kind of interpretative meaning.  - Dual Ending.  There's a good &amp; bad ending.  -Some kind of replayability.  If you want to see both endings or collect all lore artworks to know all the history the game might be +5 hours longer.    v CONS v  - There are no rules, you learn them mistake by mistake.  In part is fun, but feel really frustrating sometimes.  - In many ways the game is not intuitive and feels unclear.  It took me 3 minutes to realize i ended the game.  - Not a horror game at all.  Even if the game is really good, it shouldn't be listed as a horror game.  - The ending could be way better. - The game mechanics are easy and they end feeling repetitive.   Overall a really different game that can give you around 5-10 hours of fun. Grab it during a sale, but grab it !  [★★★☆☆]",1

"this is a classic, very well constructed game which stays interesting for players of all ages.",1
"The game itself is a timeless classic and deserves a million thumbs up. But as of NOW, and for THIS edition of the game..  Conflux, powerful combo artifacts, new map locations, and the random map generator will be missed, but the prospect of a smooth(?) multiplayer environment, where you won't have to experience 'can't connect, timed out' to a computer 5 metres away meaning you don't spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone into the lobby and God forbid anyone disconnects during the 4 hour session... Worth. Or so I thought....  We're missing LAN - the only reason I (and probably you too, if you ever buy this) got this edition is because windows no longer supports IPX and all the problems that came with trying to start a session on TCP/IP. But no UDP? Not a gameplay issue and we are expected to play via steam, but still..  Also, multiplayer got a new problem. There is this previously unheard of 5~10 sec 'loading' period at the end of EVERY HUMAN PLAYER'S TURN, where all animations freeze and you can't do anything, kinda like the little unskippable tune you had to hear at the beginning of every turn during hot seat, just more insane with no workarounds (and that tune served a purpose, like kicking your friend out of the room before he spied on you - this doesn't) - I have no idea what the game is doing while it throws me an hourglass but it wasn't and shouldn't be there. Most of us do indeed alt+tab during opponent's turns, but early game this practically doubles turn cycles.    Please tell me they're patching the hourglass thing. Or I might go back to giving it fifty tries to play the game the old way.",-1
Most fun I've had since Halo multiplayer. Awesome game!,1
steam you ad this for 14.99 $ this no good game,-1
"Welcome, this is my first serious review and I hope you have fun reading it!   Shadow Warrior isn't what you would consider to be a reboot or a remake of an older title. The best term to consider it as would be to call it a 'Re-Imagining'. Everything in Shadow Warrior pays homage to the 1997 version, ranging from the deliberately cheesy humour to the bombastic and downright ridiculous arsenal of weapons.  This game is developed by 'Flying Wild Hog', whom of which are known for creating 'Hard Reset'.  You are Lo Wang a presumably mid thirties agent of Zilla enterprises, who is tasked with finding the fabled katana known only as the Nobitsura Kage. However as one may expect, things do not go to plan. You are immediately introduced to the smooth, fast and visceral combat in the form of the katana. The hit registration feels perfect as you begin slicing your way through hordes of foes. I won't say much about the story anymore, with the exception of the fact that you are quickly introduced to a magical being who gives you awesome flashing abilities.  The special powers you recieve allow for some stylish ways to decapitate your enemies, whether it be by flinging a blade of energy at their pathetic head or whether you prefer to do a 360 degree spin to destroy multiple enemies at once. The sword play feels so great and as a result you'll be spending most of your time using the katana whilst also trying to achieve the best possible score in a segment of each level.   The gunplay however, starts of relatively weak due to the lack weight when firing certain types of weapons. This is especailly prevalent in the revolver because of the lackluster sound and uninspired concept. But as the game drip feeds you more and more weapons, the more and more awesome they become. Thanks to weapon upgrading system, you can add absurd alternate firing modes to certain weapons. Ever wanted to launch all of your rocket launcher ammo at once? Well now you can!  The game for the most part looks absolutely beautiful, and I believe that is due to the vibrant colour palette that the developers decided to use. The textures looks high res and the lighting effects can cause you to lose yourself in the environment. My only concern in terms of the graphics is that they tend to over-use warm colours a lot, and that can cause some difficulty in navigating your way around the level due to the objective flashing orange.  Speaking of levels... The level design is for the most part average, the segments of the level don't feel like they connect together to form one cohesive environment. Instead it feels like a mish mash of rooms filled with enemies to fight with the occassional area that branches out and allows you to explore. Despite the well thought out concepts and aesthetics, the levels are generally not very interesting.  Now to my final gripe, the boss battles. They essentially feel like a larger more powerful version of the games beefier enemies that take a substantially longer time to kill. These battles aren't all that engaging to participate in as they feel repetitive and downright boring. The boss battles goes as follows. Wear down boss-&gt; Shoot Important Part-&gt; Wear down Boss-&gt; Rinse and repeat.  Do I think that this game is worth a purchase? Heck yes, this game puts AAA first person release titles to shame! The combat is absolutely amazing and I never tired of it (With the exception of the boss battles) and there's enough snarky and crude humour to please everybody. So, if you enjoy good FPS games with a fantastic feel of badass, Shadow Warrior is definitely one to pick up.  Feedback and criticism is welcome!",1
"The spiritual sucessor to The Incredible Machine, with the same quirky humor and sometimes ludecrous solutions, is here in the form of Contraption Maker.  The game revolves around you assembling Rube Goldberg machines to perform otherwise trivial tasks, like activating a can opener, or guiding a mouse back home. This gameplay requires you to think outside the box for a majority of the puzzles, which makes solving them all the more satisfying. Anyone can pick up this game.  The sound design is amazing, from the music to the sound effects. A lot of love was put into keeping the atmosphere as similar to The Incredible Machine as copyright would allow. Everything sounds exactly the way it should.  In my opinion, the game's best feature is the Steam Workshop compatibility. With it, you can share machines you've made with everyone who owns the game, so even if you complete all the built-in levels, you can still enjoy the game.  With all of this said, I love this game (My playtime is deceving). It's fun, and well crafted, taking everything I loved from The Incredible Machine and improving it.  This game gets my Seal of Recomendation. It is a must-have title. If it looks like fun to you, odds are, it will be. Pick it up, even at full price. Not to mention, you get two copies for less than average price. Put your thinking caps on.",1
"I received a lot of flak over this review but in the end I was right.  A poorly done and abandoned Terraria clone with a mechanic (darkness) that could be cute if the game wasn't punishing, derivative and not a whole lot of fun. The UI is very clunky, the game buggy and development extremely slow. The world is less interesting and the game simply isn't as fun as Terraria (or Starbound or a half-dozen other similar games). That's really the key here - it's derivative and there's no real compelling reason to buy or play this. There are simply too many games that play the same way that are clearly better.   One of my biggest concerns was that the development plan didn't look like it was going to happen. I said so and was roundly criticized for it. Then two years later the developers want customers to now pay for features that were promised (and listed on the Steam page) via DLC because they haven't made enough money. Then when that plan wasn't met with overwhelming joy (is there any wonder why?) they just abandoned the game without another word. So if you do decide to buy this, know you're only getting 1/3rd of the original planned game - and it shows.  Simply put, save your money folks.",-1
"Great for those who enjoy Warhammer 40k and Space Marines. My mates had a blast in mulitplayer mode. Only get when its on sale, fun game, can get a bit dull at times, best played with mates who enjoy Games Workshop/40k type stuff.",1
i want my money back!! i thought you can do missions with other players. you can only pvp.... :(,-1
"Amazing game. It's funny, cute, silly, and let's you have a choice whether to kill or have mercy, and whatever path you take, it changes the game a whole lot!",1
Awesome game I love the gameplay. Keept up the good work! :),1
"No doubt one of the greatest games out right now.  I was hoping for a strong singleplayer experience and WOW... I was completely blown away at how fun it was. Clever level designs that flow and feel massive most of the time. Oh, and the charm it dished out with it's dark humor had me chuckling several times. LOVED IT.  I don't play much on MP but it was fun enough for me to get into it here and there. Snapmaps adds unending replayability. There's been unconceibavle scenarios created with it and is quite easy to make maps and even manipulate your own game mode... all on your own.",1
"Unique. Innovative. Pensive. Raw.    This incredible, emotional game stands alone. No other war game I have experienced is as thought-provoking and realistic as this. This War of Mine places you in the shoes of innocent civilians in horrific conditions, not only trying to stay alive, but keep their humanity intact. Amazing game. Give it a go.",1
"Pretty damn fun with freinds, not so fun alone. Very grindy if you want everything, but it's much better with freinds. This is one fo the few singleplayer titles i'd reccomend playing with freinds, even if the netcode's a bit off. Fun, fast and very entertaining with great humour and spectacularly entertaining moments",1
"Story is incredible. Game is unfortunately unplayably glitched out to the maxxorz and the company I'm sure know this, whether they plan to fix it is a mystery. I doubt it with their efforts going toward fallout 4 now and I believe a new Elder Scrolls.",-1
Best Game to spend time on :D,1
"Been playing this for about an hour and i'm loving it! it's like a mixture of a FPS God of War, DOOM and Diablo. Great game!",1
"I cant understand all the negative reviews! The gamemode are great, expecially survival and with 3-4 friends its incredibly fun. Multiplayer is a different thing. The servers are often filled with griefers and its just not fun.Anyway, 0,99 is a super cheap price for this great game and you wont regret buying it.",1
"One of the funnest games I've played in a while, I love it! (I had this game long before I got it on Steam.)",1

"Marvellous gem, unexpected treasure. Don't look at cute and pinkish graphic, you will forget about this in about ten minutes and then simply find it charming, because the game is a clearly wonderful and one of the most roleplaying games (in a pure definition of this word) ever. Your Elodie can be charming and diplomatic, straight and harsh, a spoiled brat who abuses her power for her own good, a wise queen who sees in a future and prefers innovation. Your princess can take pretty much any role, that you want for her. But any of her actions, any choices have their consequences and the story, that you see, despite a main carcass, will be different each time. It's really cool to feel how your actions change the way of things. This and all trial and error way of gameplay of course.",1
You're a pig who does martial arts and fights to the death against a never ending horde of wolves. How much more do you need?,1
"A decent game once you get mods to iron out all the problems not corrected by the developers. Game is poorly optimised and without DLC is a little bare. Not much to say, overal rating 5/10",1
I'm really not a fan of this kind of game. More like a visual novel than an 'adventure'. It's very much 'on rails' requiring you to only make quick response inputs now and then for sims-like reactions from the other characters you interact with. It's an unusual approach these days but not one I'm a fan of. I'm all for games that explore a decent storyline but not when that storyline is pretty much all there is to them. The whole interactive movie thing was tried way back when CDROM first came out. They didn't play too well then and they don't play too well now. Some may find this entertaining but personally I feel gaming should be about a lot more than a story that requires occassional inputs from the user just to shift them along and the odd puzzle here and there. Admittedly I haven't played it for long but this is because I just don't WANT to.,-1

"Resident Evil 6 is considered a deception by the fans of the this game´s series, but the fact that the game is relatively cheap (on promos) and can still bring a lot of fun (playing with someone else is even better) makes this game worth the award of 'A deception but still a good game'",1
"Warning: Crashes alot, sometimes crashes so much one will give up on it, times often make matters worse, had to deal with when it crashes via dump file rather than something you can actually fix.    Want to spend $20 on a game?  This may not be your first choice, but keep it on your wishlist.  Banished is a game about keeping a population fed, clothed, happy, and most importantly, alive. Failure to do the first 3 will result in the last one.   While many people call this the 'Starving simulator 2014' or 'Whydontchildrenworkwhileschooling2069'   Banished really has a good place. That said, its not a big game in any sense of the word. One may find they have everything, have done everything, and will do everything relitivly quickly. Do not let all this spit you down though, Banished really is a fun game, its core revolves around constant vigilance, and its externalities make you feel like you're actually looking over there poor people. While it may not be worth the $20 yet, if you happen to have some lying around, or have no more games to pick, Banished is one I highly reccomend.  Warning: Issues may arise.",1

"Fantastic game. Has elements of Galactic Civilisations 3, Sins of a Solar Empire, EU4 and some other grand strategy/space games that I can't remember. The type of game that makes you say 'just 5 more minutes' which subsequently turns into 5 more hours. Very fun! Highly recommended.",1
Get it...now...,1
"Got it with the Humble Bundle and it was one of the few games I hadn't already played. I really didn't enjoy it, such a step back from both Colours and Generations. It just doesn' feel like Sonic to me anymore. Because it's Sonic there are a few glitches and bugs but thankfully nothing gamebreaking. I really enjoyed the music though, so thats a plus. All in all it's not completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but it isn't good either. If you are looking for a good modern Sonic game, go ahead and buy Generations since Colous isn't available in Steam.",-1
"This game is good if you like Divers VS Sharks  Such a good concept but the game still needs alot to give it a long lifespan  Overall, get it",1
"If you want a complex stat based RPG then this game is perhaps not for you. But if you enjoy rich storytelling and the gritty atmosphere of a fantasy future in which corperations rule and intrigue is round every corner, then give Shadowrun a look.",1
"This game is perhaps my favorite game of all time, as the numerous game modes are very fun. If you aren't into playing multiplayer there is a fully featured single-player. Violence is totally optional. This game is Minecraft with physics, no grid that you are confined to, and most importantly you can play it with any play style. The only limit of the game is your imagination or your computer, and this game can run on any computer. The toolgun is the base for all creations as is the Physics Gun. AND if you get bored of the normal game, you can use the Workshop for Addons (mods) and completely change the game or lightly modify the HUD. If you do get bored get these Addons. If you are a...  Tinker: WireMod  FPS lover: M9k or FAS   Race Car Driver: SCar  Not only the Addons either, the game modes in multiplayer offer endless possibilities. I'll give a list of my favorites and a short description.  Prop Hunt- There are 2 teams, the Hunters and the Props. The props can turn into any prop and then they try and blend in. The Hunters try to find them, but the twist is that if they shot the wrong prop, they loose Heath.  Trouble in Terrorist Town- The most popular game mode. There is one Traitor who's job is to kill everyone else on the server. The Traitor can get special equipment such as a silenced pistol. The Detective is the good version of the traitor. His job is to root out the Traitor. The rest of the people are innocents.  Murder- A slightly less fun version (in my opinion) that there is a murderer with a knife and a guard with a gun.   Sandbox- The normal game but multiplayer. This mode lets the host use mods to make their game better or more fun.  DarkRP- A attempt to simulate whats a active city would be like. You can be part of gangs, the police, or a mayor.   In summary, if you are thinking about getting this game do it and you will get your time and money out of it.  ",1
Love this silly little game. I have several worlds with different styles of house.,1

"I have to review this one because everyone has to know something important. VR games look and feel completely different than watching them. I already hear people saying, 'Why should I buy a game to punch colored balls with my colored shields?' Because, you punch colored balls with your colored shields to a beat. The audio makes all the difference. If your on the fence about this one, buy it, play an hour, and if you hate it, by all means return it, Steam's return policy is somewhat generous now. But I promise you, if you play for an hour, you'll see the appeal.",1
"Fun premise, but the frustrating controls, bugs, severe lag, and otherwise poor UI ruins the 60 second scavenge run that the game is supposed to be built around. The bulk of the game is spent on a mostly static image of the bunker where you ration supplies and make choices for random events that occur each day. This is entirely text based. If you loathe random number generators, then pack your bag full of soup cans and run for the hills. The game is briming with humor, however, the jokes will become repetitive as you will likely encounter the same events on each playthrough. If you can look past the clunky initial 3D portion of the game, you might find the choose-your-own-adventure style game amusing the first few playthroughs, but the replay value will likely diminish steeply. Worth buying if the developers optimize the game and the price drops to around $5.",-1
"I been playing this game 3 years , and finally it appeared on steam :D.",1
Best COD game ever!! Must buy)),1
Fun when you play the campain mode but over all thats the only good thing for the most part So I would get it when its on sale but no one plays it much at all. It is a good game tho but its just old so thats why no one plays it.,-1
"Dragon age: origins review   May contain spoilers   Dragon age: origins [DAO] The Genre is an third person Role-Playing - Action RPG developed by bioware it is available on Xbox 360, PS3, PC it was made in late 2009  Story: 9/10 The game is set in Ferelden the character you play as is a gray warden The origin story you does not fit into the game and they all result to the same thing which is going to Ostagar. I don't like the part of the game where you have to go to Ostagar but the rest of the game but the rest of the game is part of an epic series of games and beats most other games in their story.  Dialog: 9/10 You have to go around finding people to help you solve the blight. The characters in this game have emotion instead of an card board cut out of a person. The people [your companions] actually makes you what to listen to the people [companions] unlike some games the voice acting is excellent you can understand what the people say I would recommend this game to anyone who likes role playing games. The people [companions] in this game are brought by gifts they like you and will even jump into bed with you if you give them the right and enough gifts speaking to them also helps  Game Play: 7/10 The game is based around the 6 origins stories this forms a basic plot for the story to come this also includes a basic tutorial on how to play I think personally they don't tell you enough they should give you more information on the tactics. Speaking of tactics you can command you're companions to do as you wish. The attacking animation on this game is so bad a repetitive most of the abilities look very similar.   Difficulty: 8/10 This game is quite a hard game I won't recommend it to anyone with anger issues if you haven't played a RPG before this would be a good place to start. The bosses in this game are actually challenging they are even harder if you put it on hard or nightmare if you decide to play on these difficulty's then be warned friendly fire is on. The achievement aren't really that difficult there is one or two but what game doesn't have these.  Graphics 6/10 The graphics in this game aren't that great on this I notice at one point in the awakening that the texture were missing for the dwarf wouldn't spoil who they are but there face textures were missing this effected the dialog because on his head all I could see was his ginger hair and beard this was very annoying especially for important scene cuts. Because I didn't know who he speaking to and I couldn't see his reaction to some dialog choices   Entertainment: 8/10 The game is addictive once you've got into it and will make you want to do multiple play-throughs. Most of the game is fun but there are a few bits in the game which make it boring like the Landsmeet it is a boring part but all you do have to do is skip through most of the dialog choices all in all this game will take up many hours of your life. 47/60 4.2",1

"Left for Dead, Left for Dead 2 one of the best games for PC Xbox or PS3 BUY IT!!!  The graghics are not the best by todays standards but then again it came out in 2009 and was fine back then, This game is all about the Zomies with fantastic story exelent game play sounds. Singal player or up to 4 player Co-Op its loads of fun and at this price its a must have game and will give you hours of game play. Character interaction is fantastic, i think they added to some stuff to Ellis vocabulary I could be wrong but the game has had a few updates and Maps ect.  On a scale 1 to 10 this game is a 11  And for the guys and Gals over at Vale whats the hold on LF4D3? The fans are waiting and im tossing money at the screen now make it happen and keep quality high like you have done in that past.   Bring out your dead!!!",1
"This game was pretty fun, I'll admit. However, it has some really short levels, aswell as being left in the dust compared to its Xbox One port content. Halo: Spartan Strike is going to be a DIFFERENT game, not DLC or anything for this game (They both look like the same game, or is it just me :/ ). We need more Halo games on Steam, with surviving communities that COULD be saved if Microsoft wouldn't be so blind and stupid! They pay billions for Minecraft, but say no to putting Halo 1 and 2 on Steam, the two Halo games that already have been ported and could be added within what, a week/month? Microsoft could make so much more money from two very loved games without losing a ton of money, but they choose not to. Oh, I could rant for HOURS, I should just leave it at that.

And so on and so forth, which, in my opinion, makes this much more than just a free 15 minute game. If you are curious and observant enough, you can get a lot of playtime out of this.",1

"TL;DR: Excellent soundtrack and graphics, awful AI, lack of freedom, vast amounts of empty spaces, and constant backtracking makes the gameplay very boring.  'Kingdom' is a town defense survival game where you take the role of a King or Queen who must build a kingdom all the same while protecting it from evil demonic forces. It's similar to 'Craft The World', but you do not have nowhere nearly as much as freedom - which is what ultimately holds the game down for me.  Pros: + Excellent soundtrack + Beautiful visual design: It's one of the best 2D graphics I've seen in a game, starting from the sky design to the reflection of the landscape on the river on the bottom of the screen. It's something to behold. + Fantastic, yet challenging first few hours of gameplay  Cons: - No freedom: Walls and Towers used to defend your town may only be built in specific areas, so you cannot build them wherever you want - Maps are procedurally generated; it sometimes places the foundations for walls and towers in really terrible positions. The most efficient way to defend your city is to place a Tower behind a Wall so that while the enemies try to break your wall, your archers can take down the enemies. But sometimes, there might not be any tower foundation behind a wall foundation, which makes you really question such bizarre design decisions. - Absolutely worthless AI: The AI is designed to get behind your walls as soon as night falls. However, sometimes your archers simply wander off into the forest and gets eliminated by the enemy units. It's really frustrating. - Lack of Depth: Once you have figured out how to manage your gold and workers, the game stops progressing. You realize that there is nothing left to discover. - Empty Spaces in your Kingdom: Once you start expanding your Kingdom, you realize that much of it is filled by empty spaces. Buildings can only be built on specific areas as mentioned above, and sometimes you will have this vast open area without any foundation at all, leaving it completely empty. It is a chore to ride through those empty areas. - Tedious and Time-Consuming: You cannot build forward outposts. If a citizen loses their tool after being attacked by an enemy (e.g. Bow, Hammer), they have to walk ALL THE WAY back to town, which is like a thousand miles away, and get their tools from there. Your character must be present wherever you want to spend gold; which means if you notice that you have to go somewhere to recruit settlers, but some settlers in your town needs weapons, you have to do either one. You can't prepare items for settlers while exploring.  These are just a few bizarre design decisions I personally couldn't wrap my head around. I could probably name 10 more (e.g. Ogre enemies causing your clumped up archers which you have no control over to lose all their weapons at once, and if there are two ogre enemies, you can lose over 10 archers at once). The worst of all is that the game will stop progressing for you, and every single in-game day starts to feel the same as the other. It becomes a chore.  Until there are some major renovations, avoid this game if you're looking for something with more freedom.",-1

Really good fps game. Recommend it for people who like call of duty or fps games. Graphics are GREAT. 10/10,1
"Really, this is an awful game. Your spotter spots out everything for you so there is no question on where enemies are, and if there is no spotter, then you die by the first mistake that you make. There is no option to get rid of the assist dot in the scope, so you are forced to play a pretty boring campaign that makes sniping seem like the easiest job in the world. Even the dialogue was pretty terrible, with soldiers arguing with their superiors, and some pretty forced jokes. I honestly felt like this game could have succeeded as it employs some interesting gameplay mechanics, but the campaign is boring, the story is uninteresting, the AI are so stupid yet can charge you and kill you easily if discovered, the characters are dull and have very forced personalities, the sniping gets old and mechanical very quickly, the dialogue seems like it was written in a middle-school 6th grade english class, there were too many times when I died not knowing why...etc. I only played 99cents for the game, so I'm not asking for my money back. It's important to understand that I'm usually willing to give sniper games a try, but this one fails on many levels.",-1

Verdict: Cosole targeted cash grab with little effort put into PC port.",-1
People who played GunZ will hate it because it's not GunZ. People who didn't play GunZ will hate it because it's a horrible game.,-1
I would not get this game if you are looking for a competitive fast pace game. I would get it if you just want to relax and have some fun. In this game you just make a city and watch your people work. You can make gladiators or chariot races. Or you can just watch the smith make a sword. The problem with this game is that it doesn't have a bigger idea to it. Once you run out of space you are done. I would deffinetley reccomened this game,1

This is definitely one of my favorite indie games yet. Gameplay is amazingly fun and intuitive with the ability to slow down time and use many different weapons. Bosses are really enjoyable to fight and levels are fun to replay to get better ranks and achievements. Definitely need a controller to play and for sure worth it when it goes on sale for $2.50.,1

Between crafting, building, collecting, fighting, and progressing there truly is something for everyone.

"It's pokemon, but with an even further simplified combat system, smaller pool of characters, terrible graphics, and no overworld.  The gameplay is basically collect cards that you use to fight other cards. there's three 'elements' and each card has a few skills. The things that differentiate this game from pokemon are all huge negatives. There is no overworld, simply 'go here, go there' menus. The story is mildly interesting, but hard to progress though because of points where you have to grind to get through. Grinding is hilariously awful because it means literally replaying the same scripted battles over and over and over again. Fighting works a lot like pokemon but with a smaller diversity of elements and more RNG.   Graphically, this game is dog ♥♥♥♥. If you like a 'half ♥♥♥♥♥ indie game' aesthetic, look no further. Character sprites are low-res, which really shows when they're placed into the foreground. It feels like you're playing with a bunch of 64x64 .png files. Most of the problem with the graphical style is you're dealing with various sprites that vary widely in resolution/zoom level, so you'll see character portraits that look to be around 64x64 displayed at scale over a background that looks to be around 64x64 that's blown up to fit the whole window. It looks atrocious and is exactly what I mean by 'half-♥♥♥♥♥ indie game aesthetic'. On top of that, the art looks like pretty low-effort drawings, for the cherry on your 'looks like ♥♥♥' sundae, but that's just my personal preferences speaking.  The extra character in 100% OJ is worth about as much as this game itself. It looks and feels extremely low effort, and if this game took any longer than a month to slap together(a week if they worked full-time on it), everyone involved should realize that they will never top 100% OJ and just give up.  Get it on sale for 50% or more off if you're a fan of OJ, otherwise pass completely.",-1
"Super tight, engaging combat. Interesting story without too big of a reliance on the narrative. Hard to put down and incredibly satisfying, occasionally repetitive.",1

Robbing banks over and over leveling up to get new items to find new ways to rob it stealthy or not this game has alot to do. Big updates happen somewhat close to eachother that add a new heist for you to enjoy and even if you dont have the dlc for the new heist you can join the lobby of someone who does. In all this game is alot of fun with alot of skills to try out and new ways to do every heist.,1
Dat myooosik though. Also would probably be a fun game if it actually followed some logic rather than just arbitrary nonsense. Some funny moments though.,-1
"great game, fun gameplay, only negative is that once in a while you get a laggy server ",1
"  Very uniqe and interesting game with a lot of fun puzzles. I like the idea of non-verbal dialogue and letting the players explore the game themselves, without any instructions. Lack of instructions can be a bit of a problem in some parts, but I still think it's well made and fun. I hope there will be a 2nd part ^_^",1

"This game runs on GFWL. So haters, please skip this review and don't buy this game.  More or less same with the original Dead Rising 2. You can read my review of that game here:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/shauntmw/recommended/45740/   The difference is, this game offers a unique feature where you can take photos with the environment. Taking special photos will earn you exp and in some cases, achievements. The plot is quite similar, except for the endings.  Good thing they removed the dead multiplayer TIR and replaced with sandbox mode. This sandbox mode gives infinite time for you to explore the game, in which the original game lacks of.  This game also have better UI, an extra area, some extra weapons, and a way better final boss.  One thing to note though, I like the original game's protagonist better, especially his appearance and personality.  Gameplay-wise, this is better. Plot-wise, I think the original Dead Rising 2 is better.  My score: 8/10",1
"Game used to be good when it worked before all the updates. However I find now that other then playing the tutorial, finding a game with all the authenticator issues and matchmaking issues is damn near impossible.  Would be a fun game if you could play it.",-1
"Honestly, one of the best Action Adventure games in years. A must buy/play",1
One of the most depressing games I have ever Played.Yet I loved every second of it.,1
Don't ya start playing this game. I said to my self well let's try this and then go to shower. Well I still didnt go... -.-' Fuuu you game :P,1
The most good 4 hour of my life :3,1
I have to give a mixed review. For me the sole reason for BO3 was for the Zombies. Love playing it and reliving the giant is amazing. The game is still riddled with glitching and bugs - I have now come to the point whereby i cannot complete a zombies game without the game becoming unresponsive! It needs resolving as it is really destroying what could be a fantastic gaming experiece! Overall i would say i enjoy the game but c'mon get these patches out now!,1
"I was really excited about the idea of a modern SimTower remake, but this isn't it. A bit tedious and uninspiring: the main complexity seems to be building out the right infrastructure, and that's just a matter of doing it &amp; scaling up the hookups. Scale doesn't bring interesting challenges, just more things to click on.",-1
Makes me moist in the Kangoroo zone bby.,1
If this game was a potato it would be a good one.,1
I wish I would have known the games sucks without the controler. Now I need to make another purchase. :/,1
"The old adage of if you've played one BioWare RPG you've played them all is not without merit. The design of this game is quite similar to KOTOR and BioWare's other RPGs, but that isn't to say that the game feels like you've played it before. It's filled with choices (as one would expect from an RPG) which could lead you down a dark path--or not. While this game is nowhere close to as visually sophisticated as it's current newest sibling (Inquisition) it's still a phenomenal game in its own right and is on my personal top 3 games of all time. That being said the game is not without flaws: I dislike the levelling system and the introduction is a little too lengthy (as is custom for BioWare). That being said, both of these can be addressed with the use of mods and the game's pros vastly outweigh these cons.  If you are hesitant to spend 60 bucks to buy into the franchise for Inquisition, consider playing Origins (especially if you can catch it on an 80% off sale.",1
Reminds of the glory days when I would make coffee out of mud and dandruff.,1
I will never have a in real life again ;~;,1
"Expect the unexpected, this game is OVER THE TOP",1
"This game was amazing!! Once I started to play, I knew it was something I had to finish 100%. After finally getting every achievement and the blood, sweat, and tears of getting 'S' Rank on every fight my neighbors now think I have murdered several people from the countless cursing and grunting that has echoed through these peaceful walls. I don't care if I get dirty looks and went through cops bagging on my door at 3am... why you ask? Because not everyone gets to say they have gotten all achievements in 'NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4' but I can... So worth it~",1
The game is OK but the servers are laggy. I stopped playing because I couldn't get a quest to finish. It was a main quest. I relogged to try to get it to work and it still wouldn't trigger. It would have probably worked eventually but at this point I say forget it. They just did server maintenance too so you would think this wouldn't happen. Also there is a slight lag when jumping. Not a major problem but still it is noticable.,-1
"For a kid in the 90's/00's instant messaging was a nightly ritual. Putting a GIANT name full of band lyrics, talking to your mates about nonsense, trying to chat up the girl you like using terrible flirtatious techniques. This game IS that. It is scarily accurate. It's also a game about losing touch with people you once considered good friends, or even a love interest as well as nostalgia for a time lost. Really great waste of an hour.  Here's my playthrough of the game:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2knLfP9bVYA ",1

"In this game you stuff small children in a sack, collect unicorn feces to grow crops, eat cheeseburgers, and bludgeon leprechauns to death to take their magical weapons. They should have just called it 'The Murtagh Simulator'",1

I played the game for 3 hours and got bored of it. Just like all total war games.,-1
Great Game .Dot.,1
"NOTE: This is a very old review. I have also been negatively involved with the developers and parted ways with the project since then, so I will not do a followup review as I think I would be unfairly biased. You should probably go look for more recent reviews than this one.  Endless Sky is a straight up ripoff (with several excellent additions) of the Escape Velocity series - and that's a good, even great thing.   Cons:  - Economy is static, not dynamic like in EV - I'm pretty sure the ships just fly around; they don't affect the economy either. For example, you can't ever clear a sector of pirates; new ones will always spawn to take the old one's places, sometimes right before your eyes - Enemy AI is incredibly stupid; I've had pirates with only missile launchers chase me down even after they expend all their missiles, which means I get a free kill  - It is definitely possible, especially early in the game, to get auto-ganked by huge mobs of enemies as soon as you take off from a planet, before you even have a chance to see what awaits you in space. Since there's no skill, just dumb luck, this is quite frustrating for people like me who try to get through games like this without save-scumming as much as possible. -Besides the rebel plotline, it's really hard for me to find any of the other plotlines. I had one other plotline offer, but I was really hoping to ally with the Republic and I have seen no offers from them at all - which sucks since you need their military license if you want to buy their ships. -There are no pirate-customized ships on sale, even on the worlds that explicitly say they are for sale.  Pros: - Combat pacing is perfect - Progression feels good - Visuals are a step up from EV:Nova - Autopilot for landing, shooting, and multi-jumping is very good - The balance between speed, power, and heat means there's a lot of thought to put into customizing your ship - Customization of your ship is properly encouraged within limits; it's possible to have a 'millenium falcon' type ship - Ship boarding actions are hugely improved from the EV series - Game is in a very stable and efficient state already - Mortgages and Crew mechanics are a great addition to make management of your liquid assets more complex - Fleet commands are of course a welcome improvement - There's plenty to explore and even late into the game I feel like there are more secrets that I will uncover with proper detective work - Game is open-source, free, and fully cross-platform. It doesn't get better from a licensing standpoint.  The Weird: - You never have to pay for fuel. At all. Yet much of the economy is apparently based around deuterium fuel processing. This makes zero sense, but I'm not yet sure whether it's a good or a bad thing for gameplay. - You seemingly can't buy any equipment to improve the quality of your long-range (on map) scans - Events happen, but I've yet to see any planets trade hands even when factions are at war. The game FEELS very static. - Every action takes exactly 1 day. You have no option to spend more days on a planet, just to use up time, and no matter how long the jump is, every hyperspace jump takes 1 day.  The Wanted: - A news feed - Distinction between privateers and pirates; faction-aligned privateers only prey on certain non-faction ships - Dynamic, persistent economy - ships should have real lives, taking jobs on worlds. If they die, they die. If no one takes a job, it stays there until someone does take it. If food gets dumped on a planet, then prices of food should plummet after the sale. Every planet should use/produce stockpiled resources at a certain hidden rate to determine how fast that depreciation recovers/occurs, and the planets should spawn new spacecraft at a given rate depending on their population.   Wonderful game with a long, long future ahead of it.",1
I nominate this game for GOTY (Goat of the Year) because reasons.,1
"Co-op'ed with a friend in this game a couple times. Its fun, unique and inventive. I look forward to the over time improvement of the game through more maps, more multiplayer options, harder robots. I would love to see a map like a major city, such as new york in the late 1800 early 1900s. Only issue ive had is connecting to a multiplayer server through the game. Both times on two different days we had to use a third party program.",1

"Americas Army: Proving Ground is an solid free to play game, with tactical gameplay, and it has some very interesting mechanics. This game only has a handfull of weapons, but each one has a unique purpose and plays a tactical role. There are two assualt rifles, one sniper, one DMR, one LMG, four grenades, and one sidearm. There are also attachment options. This game has a revive mechanic, a bleeding out mechanic fixed by a bandage mechanic. This game also has great maps, with flank routes, and verticality. Also this game is completely free, no hidden purchases, and the fact that this game is in BETA means that hopefully, there is nowere to go but up, but also remember that this game ha been in beta for more than a year. The fact that this game is the official game of the U.S army adds some interesting loading screens with videos of the real army. I recommend this game, its free, you have nothing to loose but 10,000 megabites of hard drive space.",1

"170 hours later... I figure it time to throw in my two cents (or two sence, whatever tickles your fancy) about Path of Exile.  Well, what I have experienced through 169.5 hours of gameplay is nothing short of amazing. No, this game is not perfect, and no this game is not for everyone (no ♥♥♥♥ this ins't communsim simulator 2016); but what this game does that is so amazing, is grant the players a true 'free-to-play' experience.  With Path of Exile, you are not forced into microtransaction slavery in order to achieve the higest tiers of equipment, maps and other content. Instead you are given the options of purchasing convenient aditions that do help gameplay, but have no major impact on furthering your progression as you play.  What else can be said about Path of Exile, is that the community is quite friendly, open and helpful. There are no shortages of guides, markets, build lists, and discussion fourms available for all players to use.  Finishing this up, I guess I should touch on the subject of updates, bug fixes, and news. Other than this post, I am rather quiet on all other fourms and can't complain about any bugs being left in the game or lack of updates. The people associated with all of that seem to know their ♥♥♥♥ and do quite well on informing players of updates, server maintainence, events and news.   So over all, solid 9/10,  'You know, It really doesnt matter what the media write as long as you've got a young, and beautiful, piece of ♥♥♥'  -Trump 2016 :p",1
"Harbor Freight: 90% off drill + bits. It seemed like a great purchase at the time.   Now you and 3 of your best friends are stuck fixing the f$(*#ng drill for the 10th time. You are stealing 14 Million dollars in gold, yet you still won't go to sears to buy a drill.    This game is still pretty fun, but once you have a heist down pat, and there is really no way you can screw it up, waiting 4 more minutes for a drill to fail 3 more times just so you can go spend 5 more minutes cracking open boxes by hand really seems like a waste of time....    ... but I'll do it again...    EDIT 10/15/15    They made it like CS:GO, but not as smooth. Box locks, popping it? I don't get it. They took the EA road, and hopefully they learn from it before they get bought by EA and shot in a ditch.",-1

"BL2 with low gravity and more character self mutterings :D They decreased the drops in BL2, with the rares going waaaay down. Now the drops in BLtPS they are almost nonexistant. 3247billion guns in the game doesn't matter if you see the same 10-20 over and over again in 2-3 different levels with 2-3 different variations. With these 'more guns' you don't get more inventory space either, defeating the purpose. Also, no good farming places? Concordia sure doesn't have them, atleast BL1 and 2 did. So no good farming spots as of yet. The one I did find was 'above my strength level' lets say. Awesome, but disappointing. 7/10  I keep adding because things keep ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. There's alot of 'death ledges' and open spaces. Which sucks since all your loot seems to fall off there.  I have changed from Not Recommended to Recommend ON SALE.

"PROS:  -Graphics: Graphics are quite nice. The bricks are very accurate to real life. Plus there are shaders.  -Eventing: You can program your bricks to appear/disappear, shoot a rocket, or you could build an entire computer!  -Bots: Comes with fully programmable bots. You can make them kill you, or fight for you.  CONS:  -Addons: You needs loads of addons to do anything really cool, or to get people to join your server.  -RTB: Return to Blockland was a great addon system with advanced features and IRC, and it no longer exists.  -Eventing: The event interface is nice for beginners, but once you start making more complex things, it becomes quite cumbersome.  -Lack of updates: The developer is inactive most of the time. Don't expect anything more to come out of this.  -Vehicle physics: Vehicles glitch through walls/floor, especially flying ones.  -Controls: Sometimes they are quite hard for beginners to learn, mostly building. If you don't have a number pad, this can become quite difficult.  Yep, that's my take on the game. It really has the potential; but it just wasn't executed right.",-1

Good:    Fun    Much to Explore    Multiplayer   Bad:    Gets Repetitive    Unclear Controls    Lacking in Soundtrack   I give it 3/5 stars. Good fun.",1
THE BEST GAME EVER!,-1
"I wanted so bad to like this game.  I also wanted to give a brief synopsis as to why this game didn't do it for me but that didn't work out, so there's a TL;DR at the end.  I've been a huge fan of everything that Egosoft has done for the last decade, the amount of hours I put into the X series since X2 has probably been the reason my plots for world domination haven't come into affect yet (at least that's my excuse), so when I saw all the concept art and everything promised by egosoft, I was real excited.   I tried this game on release and it WAS as bad as everybody said it was. It was terrible, it crashed non-stop, the AI was painful, but those are the only two things Egosoft have seemed to improve on since release. Against my better judgement, I read the steam reviews and saw everyone saying to 'give it another chance. You love egosoft. They love you.' And I did. And I regret it. Here's why:  - This whole game is the embodiment of 'half-♥♥♥♥♥.' I will reference the human models and movement, the dialogue, the transience of the dialogue, the plot, the textures, the trading. It was like they took an idea, threw some things together and said to each other 'This kind of looks like that! Let's use it!'  - The ship (singular. That's right, you get one ship that has been described from the get go as a 'piece of junk' and they're not lying) doesn't feel nice to fly. It's responsive, sure, but it's just not 'immersive', a concept that the creators obviously tried very hard with in regards to everything else.... *elbow nudges*   - The menus never stop being confusing. the maps aren't insightful, maybe this one part is immersive in the fact that it looks like somebody designed it and never decided to change it. It's horrible.   - The AI is still mostly terrible, but it's just not terrible enough that when you're not looking, it can do what you asked it to do. When it comes to your ship though, it's not even worth using the autopilot command, because it was obviously designed by Japanese Engineers during World War 2, you're going head-first into whatever it is you'd like to go to.  - Design-wise, the ships look great. This is something I always appreciated about the X-series. They had a wide range of ships, from god awful (Xenon - Teladi) to sleek and sexy (Terran - Terran. (Maybe also the paranid.)) However the textures and aliasing issues let them down if you ever want to admire them. My system is more than capable, so don't let there be confusion there. I have a team of several hamsters working around the clock to make sure I can boost my graphics as much as I want, but the game was having too many issues with this. Your co-pilot's (Who is so unlikable I literally forgot her name on purpose) hair was either having some graphical issues, or it was super cool and futuristic and could change between red highlights to jet-jet-black to white, all in the space of several miliseconds.   - The sound design is awful. Awful. This was something Egosoft didn't pay too much attention to previously, as many of the looped sounds were 2-3 seconds long and it was obvious they were just looped samples, but it wasn't obvious enough to bug me. Now in stations, there are many more of them, and you hear them all the time, and the transition is so obvious Steve Reich would be disgusted. The music in the highways bugs me the most, and oh boy, let's talk about the highways.  - One of the things I liked about the X games was that they were at your own pace. If you wanted fast paced, you could have that (kind of), if you wanted to slow it down and be a trader, you could do that as well. But with the removal of the time accelerator, this absolutely awful 'Boost-in-exchange-for-shields' addition and the highways, it was like they were trying to make the game more interesting all the time, but again, it was done in a severely half-♥♥♥♥♥ fashion, so none of it is fun, none of it is immersive and it makes you feel like an idiot when you drop out of the highway because your mouse was a centimeter from the center of your HUD. It's a bad minigame, with no obvious parameters for collisions with other ships, the lighting from the systems your travelling through often obscuring whatever it is that is in front of you. Of all the things I didn't like in this game, I didn't like these the most. My best example of this would be audiosurf, except the music you're listening to is start menu music from a low-budget game from 1998 that lasts 3 seconds, looping over and over but not even perfectly, so the tempo is off, and you can't really see the bricks you're meant to hit and not meant to hit, and your rent is late again and your parents really want you to visit for the weekend.   - The human models haven't been upgraded since X2. Remember, when you first meet Saya Kho onboard the Express and you were like 'WOAH, what the F**K is that thing!', well that's what they're still like now. The textures have barely even been upgraded, the movement is so non-human it's actually unnerving, the 'guards' that you see inside stations have weapons that look like they cost 1.49 in your nearest pound shop. The dialogue is abysmal, everyone is talking like they are trying to record an automated message for EA customer support, a lot of it makes no sense in regards to where it came from and why they said it, much like EA customer support. Maybe this is art, and Egosoft are trying to describe a future far from now, in which the masses have been silenced and free will has been an illusion for so long, humans aren't even good at feigning it anymore... Probably not though.   And that's as brief as I could make this rant. Wow.   Look... Don't buy this game. I believe as a community that still cares about good space Sims, if we all collectively believe that this never existed, there's still hope.   Egosoft, if you ever get around to reading this, please just let us go back to the way things were. I miss you.    TL;DR: Not bad. 7/10  ",-1
the best game until csgo release,1
Pretty fun turn-based mining game. Plays a bit like a boardgame. Choose different classes of dwarves and attempt to bring the most treasure out of the mine. Play vs CPU or friends (hotseat only). Lots of variety in the maps and enemies. One of the more unique and continually enjoyable indie games I've played. Highly recommended!,1
I played this game ike 5 times and it's still good. If you need a good short game this is it!,1
this game has alot of potential but they limited it to just repair the base they should of added were u build stuff and repair it and 4 multiplayer u compete 4 better base and that kind of stuff,-1

Great Game!!!,1

Really nice detective adventure with cool logic puzzles. Sometimes hard but it is worth to play it!,1
"i got this game on sale for pretty cheap, i thought i'd try it out, looked like another cheesy top down shooter, boy was i wrong. its friggen awesome, fast paced, challenging, and requires thinking and skill, GREAT game",1
One of my all time favourite games - not worth playing without mods. I have a combat mod that fixes the broken combat but does tend to unbalance things. I wasted tons of time with this title - including modding the game myself. Definitely recommended.,1
Not only is this a fantastic game in its own right but the sommunity support and development of mods that provide new and interesting challenges ensures that Crusader Kings will continue to be a staple of grand strategy enthusiasts.,1
"If you can't stop feeding your addiction of logic, reasoning and black &amp; white graphics then I hope this will be enough food for your decision making part of the brain.  I highly recommend to those interested in the following subjects: - Optical illusions: 2D logic puzzle - Psychology: Forces the player to reevaluate their preconceptions of: - Physics &amp; Perspective: control of the gravity - Mathematics: - Geometry: infinity, reflection and symmetry - Impossible architecture - Art inspired by the graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher: done by Mario Castañeda - Konami code hunt  I look forward to upcoming projects from Ty Taylor and his team.",1

However, what remains the same is the abundantly fun challenge that is The Binding of Isaac. Be warned, this game is highly addictive.",1
"This entire game was pretty much made from the ground up by one man, and it has better mechanics, art, combat, overall design and stability than many other actually good AAA and indie titles these days. The furry aesthetic is mostly harmless, if a bit off-putting. As a dabbling artist I'm somewhat biased in enjoying this purely from admiration of the environments and spritework, but for those of you looking for gameplay it's got a combat system with DMC-esque emphasis on combos and junk. Check it out.",1

"At the beggining I was starting to like this game, but after I played a bit I stoped likeing it for the reson that I can't shot. The game says that to shot with your primary wepon you just left click and to shot with your secondary wepon you right click, but I tryed both and I wasn't able to shot.

really recommended i really do even though im a guy there is a girl hidden inside here you know! the idea of going through a magic school is cool enough on itself and its refreshing to see a nice and short VN on steam this could mean alot for the few japanese indie developers that do VN if this is as popular as i am assuming it is. enough rambling about all that  so ahem... wait... i dont do reviews... well errr... how do i do this...  this is your basic VN with your basic young girl discovers she has magical potential (i think) and goes to this magic school where you go through school life but rather than just your average high school love VN classes actually do something they help you earn points in different colors of magic but i wont explain that you'll have to play the game to find out about that and earning enough points in a certain color will grant you a spell but you cant just cast your mighty magic and blast everyone at school into pieces (could be fun... but that ruins the idea of a VN) but you use these spells in your exams so if you keep slacking off and not learn enough spells you will fail these exams and the story can be quite interesting depending on who you are going for though the numbers of 'love interests' are limited but it does have a ton of replayability (unless your lazy and save at every multiple choice) also you create your character at the start of the game (duh should have said that at the start) i really recommend it but only if you enjoy VN's and guys this is steam dont expect anything dirty maybe some suggestions but no naughty stuff in here  p.s this is probably not from japan but this could open the eyes of japanese doujinsoft creators,1
"I tend to be a very avid fan of Simulator games in general. However game really needs some interface work. Nothing is clear and the very basics of the game are not explained in the tutorial. It is like the creators are expecting that you have played all the previous work they have build and just know how to run.   This is the first game that I have purchased from steam where I feel I have wasted money. Even with the summer sale going right now it still isn't worth the money that I put towards this.   After following the tutorial number 1, I failed it 3 times because apparently I wasn't stopping in the right spot even though I am right in the zone that the tutorial is telling me to stop.",-1

"Was a great fan of the board game when I was yopunger. Although there are still some bugs to be ironed out this is a great computer based version of the game. Pros: Graphics are great Turn based rules are easy to follow range of weapons is acceptable New patch has made loading and game time much quicker.  Cons: Although the introduction of two hired swords is good, more of the original hired swords and more diversity with races is needed. It would be good for the CPU to be cautious sometimes instead of rushing in to often Rout test often comes to quickly  Overall though a very enjoyable game",1

Firaxis made a below-average game, and is expecting modders to complete it. Just get Civ 5 (even vanilla is better) or Alpha Centauri.",-1

"The complete version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Human Revolution allows you to customize your gameplay to how you want it. Like your guns? You can upgrade your weapons and exercise extreme lethality. Want to avoid conflict? Focus on your augmented upgrade and sneak your way around the enemies. Although most of the bossfights seem to be direct confrontations, the gameplay tailors itself with how you want to play. It also helps that the game looks and oozes that dark future, which ironically also seems to be somewhat awesome-looking, thanks to the art-direction of this game. Overall, if you are looking for an awesome RPG, Deus Ex: Human Revolution will not disappoint. I am totally hyped for the Mankind Divided!!!",1

"Surprisingly complex and addictive.  Had a bash on this because of the Humble Bundle. Heard it was great, and was not dissapointed. Some of the puzzels make little sence (like a board dude not being excited by cthulu/Giants/Explosions animated around him)  but it still has a great theme.   The music is pretty nice as well. And the plot seems to be a thrownback to the old NES days. Simple structure, but good moral and nice charecters.  If you can find this on the cheap, pick it.",1

"This game is really good for a early access game. It feels like its a complete game even though its in beta. The maps are a decent size and weapons are relatively easy to find and easy to access. Every gun sounds and handles great with little to no problems about bullets not registering. I haven't experienced any lag and there are little to no bugs from what I see ( except an occasional zombie getting trapped behind some funiture). the graphics are good and maps are pretty well detailed. The AI is kind of derpy at sometimes. In some cases you could be standing yard or two away from zombies and they wouldn't even see you standing there. My only big problem in the game I see is that you get control of the situation to quick! there is almost little to no dread in the 'survival' situation of the game. If your playing with a well coordinated team or just one friend in any of the modes theres not much you haft to worry about except other players. Now what I mean by that is sometimes weapons, ammo, and health are too easy to find and stack way to high!!!! you could have more then 100 rounds in any smg, assualt riffle, or even the pistol. Besides the rediculous amount of ammo you can obtain with four weapons is that the hordes of the zombies are too small.   Pros: - No lag - every gun looks, sounds, and handles great. - decent graphics, good maps, well detailed enviroments - classic shoot in the head to kill zombie style gamplay  Cons: - occasional bullet not registering and weird AI - loot in the game is to easy to access   overall 8.5 out of 10 would like to see a variety of new maps, maybe make it so you can't contain so much ammo, and more random hordes of zombies.",1

You choose to be the guy who will always be there for her? Nope, she still friendzones you.  The game have multiple choices of answer for you to pick, but they delivers you to the same end. There's no 'good' ending, and whatever path you chose have literally zero impact on the storyline.  It brings back a lot of nostalgia, though, like Windows XP and it's system Sounds,and AOL/MSN.

Cutscenes are decent. But it's just boring and pointless at times, and there is no variety to the enviroments. Just boring Afghan bunkers, towns, and endless boring desert. It gets boring quick. The story is pointless in a way. Big Boss's story is less interesting when Solid Snake's story has already finished. Meh.",-1

"  If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

"Toukiden: Kiwami is an action-RPG. The protagonist is a new Slayer in the Utakata village, located at the border of Oni(demon)-free world. The one and only task is to protect humans (and Tenko) from Oni. Character's appearance and starting weapon are customizable. New weapon and armor can be purchased from merchants or crafted from Oni parts. Mitama (spirits of historical figures or fictional characters) determine character's class and abilities. Mitama can be obtained from defeated Oni only. The process of slaying a large Oni starts with destroying its body parts (legs, tails, etc.), then purifying those parts (otherwise the Oni regenerates it) then attacking the Oni true form (transparent, blue or purple). Oni's behavior changes during battle.  AI companions are adequate and helpful. Chapters and Phases are similar, but the former is Offline Story mode, while the latter is Online mode. Graphics, sound (warning, there's no English VA) and controls (customizable key bindings) are fine.",1
"Really not that bad of a game. It was short, but I'd already expected that from reading the reviews.

"Fun game. Despite combat getting repetitive, it's brutal and satisfying. The game is short (5-6 hours depends on your skill) but since it gets repetitive, I think the length is just right. The story is good and I actually care about the main characters. It feels very much like playing Gladiator+Spartacus.  There are some downside though. - The game is quite demanding. My PC is Core i7-6700, GTX1060 6GB, 16GB RAM, Windows 10 64bit, and I get 60 fps out of Arkham Knight on ultra. However, when I set Ryse on highest settings, it gives me 30fps and drops to 20 something quite often. Normally, I don't mind playing games at 30 fps but I don't know why this game feels very stuttering. In a game where timing is important, stuttering frame rate could actually affect the gameplay.  (Dropping some graphic options down to normal and low helps though, getting 50-60 fps and the game still looks nice.)  - You can't adjust the brightness in-game. I pushed the brightness on my monitor (Samsung, contrast thingy 10000:1) all the way up and the game is still a bit too dark.  - The music and cutscene volume is a bit too low compare to the sound effects.  - It doesn't offer much in terms of replayability. And if you hate QTEs, this game is definitely not for you.  In conclusion, the game is short and sweet and it's only $3 on sale.  7/10",1
"Fun little tower defense game, but lacks variation of strategies to finish each level (it's quite repetitive).

"So I never got to fully experience this game. I did not know what to do and the manual was not helpful(too much text)(too lazy to read). The game mechanics are well rounded, I found the enemy AI to be quite aggressive. For a classic game such as this, I know that there are no updates. But here's the review.  Mechanics: Well rounded and very stable. Though it did take me about 1 hour to figure out the controls, and another half hour to figure out how your car effects the environment. Once I figured it out, I could actually play the game. Once playing the game, I didn't neccessarily fall in love with the mechanics, but I'm smart enough to know that they are well built mechanics. I did not run into any glitches in the game, rather the game is very un-userfriendly if you don't know what you are doing. Mechanics Rating: 7/10  Story: The story is presented in text and didn't seem very interesting to me. Caterpillar people just doesn't ring any bells. But if you can past the absurd setting and characters, then the story is a good story. You play a runner for the caterpillar overlords and do something, I mostly skipped the story because I was having trouble finding out how to play the game. I never got far into the story either so I'm reviewing the front cover of the game storywise. Story Rating: 6/10  Artwork: I happen to be a fan of all types of artwork in videogames so the dated looks don't effect my review. This game is in 2.5 D from a top down perspective. I at first did not know the difference between up and down elevation wise in the game but after some time I figured out how the graphics system worked and the hints that are made for up and down and passable through. I want to grade the artwork by 2d and 3d standards but I can't single one portion out. The tone of the artwork is slightly disturbing in a good way that complements the story. The character models are all well built and there is no flaws artistically Artwork Rating: 8/10  Replay Value: I personally don't want to play this game but if you like the game, it holds an immense replay value. Replay Value Rating: 4/10  Price to Hours Ratio: $7 : (approx) ~20~ Price to Hours Rating: 10/10  Total Rating: 70/100",1

At the point of writing this review, I've only played this game for two hours, and I ALREADY love it!  For such a low price, I totally recommend this game to anyone who's looking for something both fun and challenging.  9/10 - Not a 10/10 because the game can get very confusing at times :P",1
"  I really like the idea of this game. I am someone who tries to play a lot of these kind of games (Timing, precisions, 1 hit-KO). It's recommended for people who also like these kind of games. There's 3 different worlds with a lot of levels and a small story line. Normally I play games for the story, but that's not really in it for me, with these kind of games. It just gives me a rush of  excitement. It's a really hard game and I think I hit my limit halfway the last word.

"hmm  All signs are pointing to this being a fanservice game.  It's probably the best game that PlatinumGames has developed, maybe tied with Bayonetta.  The general tone and pacing of Metal Gear Rising is much different than other Metal Gear games, but the method of revealing lore through codec calls was retained. This was inappropriate for the pacing of Metal Gear Rising, and the resulting incongruence was disappointingly jarring. Only a small portion of the lore revealed through codec calls was of the caliber of previous Metal Gear games, which was also disappointing. The story was rickety, and the ending was especially weak.   The long dialogue between Senator Armstrong and Raiden was lacking in conviction or basis in the real world, so it was difficult to relate to. Gave me the feeling of 'Hmm, this is kind of BS.' This is another big disappointment, because the topic of the overgrown military industrial complex in the United States is very interesting and relevant, but its presentation in this game fell flat because the moral grayness of the industry and its participants was not explored much at all(as would be expected of a game in the Metal Gear franchise). Instead, the industry's portrayal was borderline sophomoric, shoehorned into a morally black and white nutshell that was not interesting or notable at all(not even fit for a shonen manga).  The game also makes a few statements about media manipulation and memes. Again, because these subject matters were not explored as much as they would have been in a real Metal Gear game, the fact that they're even there doesn't feel natural.  Because of the faster pace of the game, the time between boss battles was much shorter. Exposition of the villains and antagonistic organizations of the game was truncated, so I was left feeling like there wasn't enough character development(character development has consistently been adequate in Metal Gear games, even for characters that die off early).   Jetstream Sam is a real cool looking character that I expected to have more screen time in Metal Gear Rising, only to see him killed off in a way that could have been a lot more meaningful. Included DLC allows you to play as Sam through his story, but it feels inappropriate for this extra backstory to have been DLC; it feels to me like a concession made due to Sam's lack of development in the main story. Sam's dialogue was especially disappointing, because he seemed to be a strongly principled character that Raiden couldn't understand(only a few of the characters in this game have strong, well-defined maxims). Raiden and Sam never actually got to communicate about any of their motivations, which could have catalyzed a change in one or both of them, which would have been meaningful. Sam's similarities to Raiden were not emphasized enough for the two to have had any chemistry as rivals, and the end result reeked of wasted potential.  Raiden was never a strongly principled character in any of the games he was in, which is intentional. In MGS2, his naive preconceived notions were turned on their head(at the same time as the player's), resulting in an interesting change in his character that was intended to resonate with the player. This risky move worked to great effect, and has been unmatched in video games since. Sadly, the new Raiden in Metal Gear Rising is impossible to relate to in this way, because Raiden has no well-defined moral opposition to any of the antagonist's motivations(and he doesn't make an effort to formulate any). In the same vein, his characteristic self-doubt only led to the rediscovery of his violent urges as 'Jack the Ripper', which did not provide him with any new focus or direction as a character. Raiden is a character that was originally designed to be dynamic, and if a character is measured by how much they have changed, then Raiden's portrayal in Metal Gear Rising was an utter failure.  Most of the characters in Metal Gear Rising are not characters I see myself remembering for a long time to come. Few of the characters had consistently clear, believable, or relatable motivations(especially not Raiden). Overly brief, insubstantial, or inconsistent dialogue between the characters muddled the already scant amount of character development this game had time for.  The game's overall message has also been stunted by political correctness. This has had the dual effect of making much of the dialogue a waste of time and preventing the game from standing out.  Short version: It was nice to see Raiden again, and the gameplay itself was not half bad. However, Metal Gear games have a reputation for their gameplay and exposition working perfectly in tandem. Previous games in the franchise have been unmatched at using postmodern expression in a meaningful way, which is a saddening contrast to this game's confused and insignificant message. As a Metal Gear fan, this game was disappointing for these reasons.   I give it 3.5/5 units of rating. It's a shell of the game that it could have been. It's still a good game(based on gameplay alone), it's just not very interesting, and definitely not groundbreaking.",1
i wish steam would update this game so it can run on windows 10 because i love this game and wish to play it again,1
Pretty good.,1
"Don't be fooled by the kawaii-cuteness overload!   This game is very intriguing plot wise. Yes, there are loud noises, creepy music, and jump scares galore! But, there are also actual monsters. Not just cut little cardboard cut-outs whose effectiveness is less than 5. Unless, you weren't expecting it. This game not only has jump scares as advertised (Woooe whee!) But, a developed plot. I myself have not beat the game.... Yet. But, I intend to. For a game that is composed of jump scares, mazes, trickery, and more. The plot is well thought out and quite a mystery. If you have heart conditions: Do NOT play this game. You will die. I highly recommend this game, as it is free, and because of the story. ",1
"First off, I love this game. BUT BRING IT TO MAC, OH MY GAWD.",1
Love the twist!,1
"More forced DLC ads please! I haven't yet had enough of them shoved into my face while playing.  Other then the DLC nonsense the game offers a whole array of features not available in other games that pretend to do what Arma really does.  The learning curve can be steep but that is only because it actually has content to explore and get used to. This is not a spawn/die rinse repeat shooter when played properly. It is a simulator! Its crazy huge map will keep you interested for hours and combine it with Zeus and you have endless of original and fun missions/scenarios.  The graphics are amazing, environment is beautiful and all of it is just waiting to be covered in the blood of your enemies whether you prefer shooting them from 2km off, runnin them over with tanks and apcs or just just plain old dropping bombs and shells onto them.  I could go on forever about this game it just has way too much to cover. It is worth ever penny, even though they did sell themselves out with this DLC crap. Shame on them!",1

"Definitely buy this game, it's one of the best of 2014. The story was great and you can easily grow attached to the sword (ash) in the game. The real reason to buy it though is the gameplay, there may be too many options at first but once you get into it, it can become so satisfying. Watch a YouTube video to see how it works and you'll realise why the combat is so original and unique.",1
"Amazing! Not as scary as the first one, but still worth a buy.",1
"A longtime fan and player of Hearthstone, I've rejected nearly every other CCG-style strategy game on offer. Those that I chose to play, I was often met with disappointment. I'm a sucker for good pixel art, so Duelyst caught my interest. For once, I don't regret it. The gameplay is solid, the UI is wonderful, the strategy is deep. Offering a grid combat system a la Heroes of Might and Magic enables complexity of strategy while implementing tried-and-true CCG mechanics, with some twists. Give the game a shot, you have nothing to lose but a moment of your time.  And if you find yourself in-game but not ready for a match, listen to the brilliantly narrated Codex. Such a treat.",1
I don't even know...,1
  I played this on xbox and i enjoyed it. its a fun co-op experince and i can play it right. sadly on xbox it ran 20 FPS but now i can play at a solid 60. its a good co-op experince with friends and its good. i played this for years on xbox and now people on steam can enjoy it aswell. not to say i got this for free. THANKS DIGITAL DNA!!!,1
"Minecraft with guns, and more lag. Thanks Jagex.",-1
"Awesome game! I'd describe it as Endless Space, but not in space.",1
" Papers, Please  starts with very simple mechanics and becomes more complex as you go through the story. Part of the complexity is deciding whether to help out the people who visit you. Your 'job' and 'salary' depend on following the protocol, but underneath the mechanics is a story about Arstotzka and the surrounding countries that people travel from.  Overall, a fun game if you explore the details. Your choices affect the outcome of every playthrough and decide the fate of the country as well.",1
"This game is great! Unique customizable characters, simple gameplay, and it doesn't feel as repetitive as most tactical turn based games",1
"I have never enjoyed the scenery of a game before. The controls and gameplay are very simple, however this dosent make the game any less fun to explore. If you enjoy exploring abondoned structures and enjoy inspecting the surroundings then this game is for you.",1
overall fun game to play.,1

Great game and fun to play.,1
"One of the best RTS's I've played (i've played more hours than shown as got this before steam as well).  Loads of armies and units, all of which look amazing. Great voice acting etc. Great bang for buck and always on sale.  Just get it.",1
"I really don't know why people are complaining about this game so much. It's Tetris! The gameplay was so smooth for me and I actually like the button layout that was given. It never crashed on me and the music was still pretty catchy! I know how some of you may not like the new modern design, and wish for the old minimalist design, but it's not bad at all. I really like the direction Ubisoft went on this one. 10/10 I think.",1
"Awesome graphics if your GPU can handle it. Easy to learn, but very difficult to master. My only complaint would be the slow speed of balance updates (for Wraith) caused a lot of the new players to deem it OP when it was just annoying to fight. If your solo learn monster. Hunter is more fun in a group.  9/10",1

"Dare I say, Super Cyborg is as good as Contra.  If you enjoy classic run 'n' gun gameplay, pick this up, grab a buddy (local or online) and use them as a meat shield... you'll need it.  Note: The only issue I had with the game was the default controller options (my controllers weren't showing up in-game). Just use joytokey if you find yourself in the same boat.",1
"While i had seen enough after less than an hour, i would certainly recommend giving this a try if you can get it cheap. The style is awesome and things get hectic and hilarious once you start bouncing around. It's also the only game i know of where you kill things with baguettes.",1
"Bit buggy but still kind of fun - especially with a group of friends. Online is really laggy for me. Otherwise, can't complain.",1
"Those Dungeons are pretty dark, they ain't lyin'.",1
I had heard about the possibility of motion sickness induced by this game but I haven't suffered since I was a child so I didn't think it would affect me. Boy was I wrong! Literally played this for 30 mins and feel absolutely terrible. I have no idea what's causing it but I don't think I'm actually going to be able to play anymore. And I didn't even get to the more complex puzzles! :(,-1
"After trying to Launch Rainbow Six : Siege for the first time, I was greeted with my AntiVirus claiming to have found Malware; I trust Steam so I marked it off as a false positive and continued to launch Rainbow Six. I then saw this UPlay crap launch on my screen, and realized it was too late... My computer has already been infested with Malware",1
"Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye.",-1
"Expendabrooooooooooooooooos!!!  Well what can I say, never really got a decent chance to play Contra or Metal Slug but this game ROCKS!!!  A great game to play on your own or even better to co-op with your Bros!",1
it is worth buying,1
The fact that these graphics are better than some modern games makes me wanna pray to Lord Gaben harder.,1
"I enjoyed every moment of this game. After playing FF13 and this, the story has become much more interesting to me and I can't wait for the final installment.  And I've actually grown to like the combat system. At first I thought it was complicated, but now I've realized how much more interactive it makes the game. Although long battles are a pain.  -Just like its prequel, the game looks beautiful, especially during cinematic cutscenes. - Music and voice acting were superb. -I didn't experience any technical issues during my playtime, and the game ran pretty smoothly all the time.   If you liked Final Fantasy 13, I'm sure you'll like this too.  Even though the story/gameplay might get a little bit confusing with all the time travelling etc, it's not too bad.  Also there are some nice new features, like Live Trigger and Cinematic Actions.",1

"A very nice quaint Gem. Fantastic soundtrack and brilliant art style. I've only played the first 35 minutes but so far it has been very good. The narrator is very good, and I love the close ties with the elders and local folk lore. This being said, the gameplay can sometimes leae me wanting - very generic and uninspiring (Gameplay) so far, though I know that isn't the focal point of the game. I would definately recomend you pick this up, especially if its on sale.",1

"The less you know about this game, the better. What is 'real' and the intended version, is all beyond a veil of mystery.  Price of admission is very fair I think. The game length works great for this kind of narrative experiment. it's quite intense. Buy and play it, just to find out what your imagination is capable of making you think, and to support interesting game ideas.",1
"100% get this game when it is on sale, isn't worth the £14.99, even if you love this game like me.  You can still do online matches through GameRanger, but that can take some to get going.  Con is that this game NEEDS steam workshop, it would keep the community more active and I would love an easier way to download mods.",1

"Hefty amounts of bugs.  Like in the first XCOM, you can shoot and be shot by enemies you have no real line of sight to or from, making any planning obsolete because you don't know whats going to happen. One of my guys got shot from outside the building he was taking cover in - right through the wall. Ever seen a soldier smash in a laser-grid window, shattering glas everywhere? You will see that a lot in XCOM 2. Displayed information for actions is occasionally incorrect or doesn't contain any info at all (like missing damage/percentage numbers). Occasionally Explosives that clearly outline the enemey units as affected, don't to jack to them. The action cam repeatedly shows a black screen with red bars - so you won't even directly see what the ADVENT soldier right in front of you is doing. And when you can see something, the soldiers usually hold the guns to each others heads or walk though obstacles to shoot at the enemy. Same stuff they did in Enemy Unknown. Also, the mission occasionally lets stuff go boom next to your squad for no discernable reason, killing off your dudes without you ever having a chance to have prevented it.   It's now all bad though. On the plus side, you can customize soldiers and weapons and even augment most of them with mods. Loads of maps are randomized now, so you won't likely see the same levels multiple times. And you have concealment now. Which basically means you don't have to creep ahead one space at a time as enemies are now unware of you until you get the drop on them. But don't worry, after that first fight, you get right back on your knees and crawl at a snails pace again as Enemy Pods are the way to go in the sequel as well...  But you have turn limits on most missions now, so the game acitvely FORCES you to run into Pods head on as you wouldn't be able to complete the missions elsewise.  [To be fair: You can mod the turn limits to be higher or non-existant, but since that is a mod-induced feature it wouldn't feel right to say that this isn't complete bullsh*t.]  So, I am not a fan.  Barely an upgrade in terms of mechanics as far as I see it and I guess XCOM has Polio again. Several design decisions such as the turn limits are highly questionable and make me actually hate this game.  This is another AAA-Beta-Relase. XCOM 2 needs a hefty dose of polish, then we can maybe talk about it being a decent game.  Apart from that there is so much freaking RNG involved, you can as well play Monopoly or Ludo. ...Gods forgive me, I acutally recommended playing those two games...  If you wanna really give this one a try, go to your cardiologist first. See if he has any objections to high blood pressure and rage fits. Because you can and will lose your favourite soldier due to a random crit of a guy that decided to go bonkers, activated by one of your squaddies taking cover behind a wall or even worse getting dragged over half the map by a Viper.  And don't come at me with 'learn how to tactics' or any other of this PCMR bs. If an outmaneuvered Muton evades all shots directed at it and then decides to ignore the Suppression directed at him and crit a heavy in full-cover in the face, melting her in one shot, there sure is a lot I must have done wrong. XCOM:EU was hard but fair. XCOM 2 is flat-out unfair in every aspect. And the way it is designed it acutally punishs tactical planning.  But if you love rolling the dice and lose all your stuff, oh boy, this game sure is for you.  Edit: Don't even get me started on the Multiplayer. That thing is just plain broken.",-1

"This is my favorite game. I've never played Magic The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Hearthstone. I looked into playing Hearthstone after I got into this, thinking that it's similar and being a former WoW player. Hearthstone's free card packs come at about a 30% rate compared to the ones you generate going daily quests in Duelyst. Hearthstone's crafting is considerably more costly value-wise, as well. Blizzard is bad at balancing.  Duelyst releases new cards every month, regularly updates imbalances in the meta (and does so fairly, regardless of what salty Vet mains will say), and really cares about its playerbase. When they added Prismatic cards to the game, people who had played before then didn't get any at first- card packs opened past that point just had more value than previously. People complained about this, and a while later they gave pre-patch players FREE prismatic cards based on how many packs they had opened previously. They could have made random cards in our collections prismatic and told us that would could enough (despite that not taking into account disenchanted cards) but they did the right thing and gave us free cards to match the value.   Yes, there are a TON of purchasable cosmetic items, but let me put this to you: people who complain about having the OPTION to purchase cosmetic items and emotes in a free game are massive babies... especially when the skins and emotes are purchasable with spirit/dust for free too.",1

"A very unique and interesting game - not exactly a traditional RTS game, in fact, it's more like a simulation-esque + some elements of RTS and city-building mashed up together. A very enjoyable game. (Initially I hated it but after playing the same campaign level 5 times and finally understanding the game mechanics, I was hooked.)",1
"This is actually a really fun game. Its a niche zombie survival game and its enjoyable. Multiple guns and defences make it addicting, and once you get into a game with a couple friends it can be fun. Dont let my playtime fool you, this is fun for the price. It isn`t the kind of game you pour hours and hours into, and it doesnt have a progression system or very many updates, so it will die eventually. But for the price, you cant really go wrong. 8/10",1

"Let me start off by saying that I loved deponia. Adventure games to me were always more about visuals, themes, and stories than actual gameplay. This is why I can forgive the downright ludicrous puzzle solutions and poor animations. The complaints that the game is 'sexist' or 'racist' I believe are silly as well. They make it sound as if Rufus is aware that he is being an ♥♥♥, which you will quickly learn that he is always blissfuly ignorant of what is truely happening and the consequences of his actions. Back on point, the reason I am not recomending Deponia is that it's ending is a great big stab in the gut to anyone who was invested enough to finish the game by completely negating everything you worked for, solving NONE of the initial goals you set out for, and ruining what emotional value the game could of had by having a side character (that appeared in only 3 scenes if I remember correctly) explain why and what you should be feeling and then being subjected physical comedy.  Yes, I'm writing this review in an impassioned state of anger and frustration; I realize that might effect the validity of my review. Unless you want to end up like me, however, I suggest you just don't bother with this game. It will only leave you angry, dissatisfied, and with a little less hope for this industry.",-1

"Now now my first review of this game wasn't very serious since everyone and their mother have played this game and I do like it... but it's the fan base that sucks. So anyway the story of this game is very simple.  This game is based off a earth bound haloween hack... so if you seen some of the character or heard some of the music tracks before then you know why.  You are a child who is climbing this mountain and trying to commit suicide ( not really) and then when you get a top of the montain you fall down a cave and you land on a couple of yellow flowers who helps soften your fall. So you wake up and explore this cave and then the first monster of the world you encounter is called Flowey the flower. He is a evil sun flower who wants to destory the world.  But then a goat called Toriel... hench... her name is a pun on Tutorial and she teaches you the basic...  And from here your adventure contines. This game combat system is very speical... you don't have to kill anyone, you just talk your way out of the battle ... OR KILL THEM IN COLD BLOOD! if you kill enough of them you will hear a creepy tone play in the batle screen and the text ''And no body came!'' just means that you have killed everyone in that zone.  Also this game has many endings. not the best game ever i'd say. Only the fanbase.",1

It's strangely difficult to get it to read 2 controllers or fight sticks.  Lack of D-input, no keyboard bindings, weaker option availability, temporary place holder story mode, no offline bot matches.   These are all things that ultra did have (well story maybe not but I don't really care either way) and if they fix them, then I would have no qualms. As of yet, I wait for many small logistical issues that slightly impede on me having fun.  Mechanically speaking this game plays great and at its core it is a great fighter.",1

"In terms of gameplay, Devil May Cry 4 is probably the best of the series. The controls are smooth and hack n slash mechanics are amazing. While I feel this game has ton of replayability, the game starts to stop the its flow by having you play as Nero and then switch to Dante in the second half, replaying pretty the majority of the game backwards. The end game is rather tedious because it relies on RNG to keep you occupied before the final moments of the game. If that whole part wasn't there, finishing the game at that point would take less time.  Aside from that, the music is cool and the game looks nice even though there is a special edition out.   If you really enjoy the hack n slash genre, this game will satisfy you. If you are new to the series, this game is the best one too start as its the most accessible of the series aside from the reboot.   ♥♥♥♥ you ",1

A pretty solid mega man clone. The controls are tight and the enemies have a certain toughness to them that makes you feel accomplished when you can run through a level without taking damage. I ran through the game once which took me 3 hours (probably takes most people a bit less) but the acheivements are mostly for doing things outside of just beating the game. If you are a completionist this game could take you a good long while to get 100% on. Overall I'd recommend it for 5 bucks.,1

This is the only series of games that causes me to burst into laughter and at some point I hope to soil my pants in the process.",1
"Whatever you do, don't buy it. It's a game that receives barely zero percent of dev support and the player base is as dead as my great-granduncle, who went missing at the Eastern Front. This game should have gone missing there, too.",-1
"Great game, looks good and is completely ftp!",1
"I mean it's Fallout man no ♥♥♥♥ it's good. Gameplay is a bit watered down for the casuals, but story makes up for it. No real bad bugs either, the only time the game breaks is when I'm ♥♥♥♥ing around trying to jump through weird geometry and ♥♥♥♥. Runs like clockwork vanilla, runs like clockwork with 100+ mods installed. Even if you blast through the story and sidequests in a few days, the nexus has enough content to keep you entertained indefinitely.  Just buy it man come on.",1
DO NOT GET THIS GAME.  WHY??? BECAUSE THE MATCH MAKING TIME IS RIDICULOUSLY LONG.  TAKES UP TO 30 MINUTES.  AVOID IT AND SAVE YOUR MONEY TO BUY A BETTER GAME.,-1
not thing to say it is good for me ^^,1
doesnt work and screen glitches out :/,-1
"It's a good game with quick matches and easy to learn controls. The controls consist of 2 buttons or 4 if you play with 2 players. It's great that you can choose to use a fight stick, controller, or the keyboard to play. Although it's a bit hard to go through the menu as you only use the selected buttons.  There a good variety of characters and costume for each. Each character has their own special attribute to their kicks and jumps. You got 2 specials for each character which are unique. One for ground and one for air. The meter for them is filled by kicking. But there is no explanation for how the specials work so the only way to find out is to play the character. There's no real way to practice in the game as there's no training mode so it maybe hard to figure out a character since you must play online or in the story mode. The matches are quick since it is a one hit kill. There are some interesting features that you can use while fighting like headshots and gems. Headshots can cripple you or the opponent by making you slow for a couple of seconds and emptying your special meter. There are 3 gems and they don't have a big difference though as I can see. The most noticable one would be the yolo gem though. Which makes lose the the match if your hit once but giving you a big stat increase.  The game has some funny parts with random qoutes during loading screen. The game would be much more fun if you had people to play it with. The game has references to the fighting game community and may go unnoticed. If you were to get it I would say to get it while it is on sale or if the 10 dollar price doesn't seem much then get it if this is something that interests yourself.",1
THIS GAME IS AWSOME,1
Completely unintuitive and uninteresting. I tried to get into and nothing worked.,-1
"Its fun, but you get people caming, spamming long ranged chars, spamming the elemental (ice fire and death) chars using the exact same moves over and over. No more updates or support, which also means there is ALOT of hackers ruining the game.",-1
Nice Relaxing Fun Game That I`ve Ever Played,1
"A classic sci-fi FPS which influenced many modern games avalible today, a game which eveyone needs to own and play.  10 / 10",1
"I had this game on the PS3 and remember playing it for hours on end along side other great games. This game is amazing for any Transformer fan, which you're probably hearing a lot about from other reviews, and for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good reason.   Sad thing about this game is as of today, the Multiplayer is dead, from my 7 hours of playing as I write this I have only had one full match of Escalation--the games horde mode. But enough just chatting about the game, lets list the Pros and Cons  Pros: - Great level variety - Diverse enemies, engaging combat - Weapon upgrade system through Teletran-1 - Replay value is great - Play as multiple characters in Campaign and in Multiplayer  Multiplayer Pros: - Create your own Autobot or Decepticon - Good progression system - DLC is actually worth purchasing, and is not pay to win by any means - Decent amount of modes  Cons: - No Co-op campaign (not a major con, but if you liked it WFC then you may miss having it like me) - There are some bugs/glitches (For me was Eye of the Storm had level loading problems, wait for a few minutes near Jazz for it to fix.)  Multiplayer Cons: - Multiplayer is overall dead - Progression to Max level Prime is time consuming - Escalation can become bland quickly, dispite the many different maps  In conclusion, great game and still holds up to this day. So glad my nostalgia for this is not just me being an idiot :P  ",1

"8-10 hours long story (Devil Hunter difficulty). I don't know whether I like it or not.. It's not a bad game, but there's something really boring about it.  What I liked:  1. Combat system, very good, skill-rich, very dynamic.. good stuff.  2. Facial animations (main characters) very good.  3. Soundtrack. 4. The Story.  What I hated: 1. Low resolution textures (besides Faces) really fkin ugly... 2. including boring, lifeless 3d models (i.e. vehicles, weapons etc.)  3. Glitched cutscenes. and broken auto-aiming 4. The main story is too damn short.  Idk guys.. i'd give it 6/10..",1

"I saw gameplay earlier, 'maybe it would be entertaining' so i got this on discount. First impressions - very nice graphics, funny protagonists and entertaining gameplay, secrets almost equal with Serious Sam that made me checking every single corner and blowing up everything to find anohter supprises. But after first bloodbaths I went deeper... I never expected any deep lore from this kind of slashers, just 'hey, this is big evil guy, we must destroy him by slaying one milion of smaller evil guys!'. Shadow Warrior storyline could be in first approach something like that, but I think, that everyone who reccomend this game also was supprised how deep is the story and how big is immersion. Ending scene just makes me...I don't even have a world, just how game ends its amazing. Game is hard itself. I have the moment, when i just slashed everything like I am a god, but later game became more and more challenging when you are surronded by every type of enemies. Still its not broken, its ballanced and even more fun when encounters force on you to use every weapon, every skill and many time the enviroment! It's not a shame to play on easier diffulty, I played on normal and still it Was a challange to me. Enemies are varied, but game don't throw on us every type on the beginning. Some of them we can meet in the beginning, but others in the middle/slow endgame. They are realy different from eachself and force on player to use also other tactic to single one. Everyone played their role on battlefield and every demon we encounter doing something realy different, for example support his allies or summon other minion (but also still hurting us badly). Later game mix often almost all types, and from autopsy I can said this - In this game, more is better. You need to think many times to survive in bloodshed. Skills and equipment are satisfying. Many weapon, which every have their own advantages and cons, which makes every usefull. Upgrades maybe makes one more universal, but still not an ultimate massacre machine. You can see it especially in endgame, where its bloodbath overload. More interesing are skills, merits of swordfighting. I use katana almost everytime I can, so I can say that its created perfectly. I never felt that I need some other skill instead that i can use, same as perks. I fully recomend this game. Its awesome, one of the best production of 2014, maybe in whole gaming history. Entartaining and challanging. Only one con is that you can finish this game in max. 15 hours, but content loaded in this makes me fully satisfied.",1
"I was attracted to this game by the artsy look and its soundtrack. Five minutes into the game it is clear that the game play is sluggish and the animations lack lustre. Additionally, it is often difficult to determine where the main character can walk on screen due to the low res' graphics. I could attempt to be charitable and say this game was aiming for a minimalist approach to the RPG genre; however, I am forced to recant any charity on account of the choppy and confusing dialogue. Had I been faced with the decision to buy this game again, I would not.",-1
"Go clean your room instead of playing this, its so boring.",-1

"  I'm hooked, no pun intended.  This game is fun, exciting, and brings the term 'survival-horror' into your house. I love how each character has their own unique 'perk' or ability, which you can teach to the other characters. The rank system for this game is pretty simple, which I also admire how you work as a team if youre playing as a survivor. Great way to build points if you work together.  With my experience, putting 400+ hrs into this game, I do have to say this game still has a lot of work to be done to it. I've seen so many patches being added to the game, which makes me feel I am still playing the beta.  But seeing that the devs have fixed previous problems, including the 'disconnecting' troll issue, I believe they will do justice into solving the continuing 'killer bots'(who farm points) that I haved faced multiple times.  But other than the notorious gltiches this game has, I still continue to play. Love playing 'Surviving With Friends, as well as 'Kill Your Friends'. Great game to play with the squad, and would totally recommend this game.    P.S. Your Jigglypuffs, make my...WIGGLYTUFF AYYYE!!!",1
You need to have a GPU that can do PhysX. It's not enough that your CPU can. This means if you have an AMD/ATI or Intel GPU/iGPU you can't run it. Haven't found a solution for this yet either...  This game gets an 2/10.,-1

As explained on a couple cite-able resources, the game is poorly ported and can either have too much fps because vsync is off, or not enough fps because vsync is on.  I wouldnt recommend this game because this issue has apparently been going on since this game was available for pc and takes troubleshooting to operate as expected.

"HEALTH AND SAFETY WARNING: Do NOT play Antichamber if you are prone to severe headaches and/or migranes, because Antichamber does just that. The game is specifically designed to get you out of your comfort zone. While not aesthetically appealing, it doesn't need to be visually stunning to stun you. While it has traditional puzzles, like jumping on platforms that sink under your weight to make you go higher, to more obscure puzzles, like going through a door backwards because every time you look at the door it closes. Here is an example **SPOILER ALERT**  You approach two staircases, one going up and one going down. If you chose the up staircase, it returns you to the staircase. If you chose the down staircase, the same thing happens, but if you go back the way you came there's a new path.  These kinds of puzzles gave me headahces on end, and had to stop playing the games. Later on you get a type of gun that shoots blocks. You use these block to open doors, solve puzzles, and if you run through certain areas you lose any blocks you're carrying (emancipation grid anyone?) Anyway, Antichamber will change how you problem solve and go about doing things differently, the apex of psychological puzzles. Sometimes you'll find pictures on the walls. These pictures can be toggled to show a sentence or two, teaching valuable life lessons. I like that much, and have made many friends following those lines.  Pros: Interesting gameplay life lessons abstract puzzles  Cons: Can give certain people migranes confusing puzzles  Verdict: 7/10 Antichamber i would highly recommend if you like abnormal puzzle, but this is nothing like the momentum based puzzles of Portal. You could sit in a room for an hour and not figure out the puzzle. If you like to take a trip that tests you sanity, then Antichamber might be a good buy. ",1

"Don't get me wrong -- I don't think that TInyKeep is a BAD game. I played through to level three... but therein lies the problem. I didn't really care to keep playing.  It took me several tries to beat level two as I found the boss to be quite overpowered and had to rely on the stupidity of the AI for the boss to kill itself by walking into traps.   The controls are not particularilly great -- it feels quite clunky, to be honest, and I get dizzy trying to constantly turn the character around to dispatch of baddies.   Also, and maybe this is just my machine (I hope not, it's an Alienware M15X with an intel i7 in it) but I found the framerate randomly dropping for no good reason during important parts.   Again, I would certainly not say it's BAD -- I just wouldn't particularilly recommend it.",-1

They still make you laugh at what a ♥♥♥♥♥ she is. 10/10 Valve. -Environments/Graphics: Beautiful environments, that shows that there was lots of effort put into them.

With time travel features to make each stage have a different feel to it in past, present and future versions of each zone there is a lot more to explore than usual.  On top of being one of the best Sonic The Hedgehog games, it has one of the best soundtracks of all-time which would almost make the game worth playing alone. In a VIP list of what Sonic games are actually genuine top quality, you wouldn't be wrong putting this as the pinnacle of the series just above Sonic 2.",1

"Pre-note:  Got the Skyrim Special Edition for free due to having a copy of the original Skyrim thanks to Bethesda.  Summary: Gave the original version a thumbs up, but for SSE well... it's good to have, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to BUY it especially at full retail price. If anything this 'Special Edition' feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead less-informed PC players to buy this 5 year old game at the vanilla version's launch price.  + Updated game engine (32 bit to 64 bit) allowing for better memory handling and greater mod support; a nice treat for graphic / mod junkies (those that load up to 100+ mods in their game) / epic grand-scale battle enthusiasts. Not much impact on the rest of us.  - Better looking than vanilla (improved textures, better water graphics etc), but we've already experienced those on PC thanks to the brilliant work of the active modding community (who've done far better graphic improvements to the vanilla version) so the impact was negligible.  - No updates, bug fixes, improvements to vanilla gameplay; old bugs in vanilla carried over to SSE version. As usual Bethesda have left that responsibility to the modding community. Why spend money and waste time when you can get free labour, right?  - 32 bit mods not compatible with SSE version, so the modding community had to start from scratch and the rest of us have to reinstall all our favourite mods (IF they get updated by the authors to support 64 bit, that is).  - Significant sound quality downgrade. Surprise! You actually get less from the SSE version than vanilla Skyrim! (someone on Reddit commented 'It's called 'Special Edition' because of the crippled audio.')   Conclusion: All in all, this feels like yet another one of Bethesda's attempt to push hard on the console market and milk a 5 year old product at the expense of the PC gaming community; a reasonable upgrade for console players but a blatant cash grab for us PC players.",-1

"Payday 2 is a wonderful a game...  A wonderful game that has been ruined by a greedy publisher. From it's release Payday 2 has been supported nonstop by Overkill. It was a game and a company that was creating a new standard to aspire towards. It was the Witcher of the FPS world.   Unfortunately, even a game that has done nothing but make money for it's creators (it was profitable from before it launched -  http://www.gamechup.com/payday-2-becomes-profitable-before-launch-covered-by-pre-orders/)  wasn't enough. After the developers had promised not to add micro-transactions, they scorned their dedicated community and added them to their game during a 'free' event called Crimefest.  As a result it has ripped their fan base to shreds. Dedicated modders, statisticians and community moderators have walked away. I have spent plenty of money supporting the game through its extensive DLC offerings, it's insulting to be asked to buy drills at $2.49 a pop that offer nothing more than ugly skins and gaming changing stat boosts.   It's unfortunate that the politics around this game have become so f#@$*! up because it was a thoroughly enjoyable game that could be experienced in a variety of different ways. There is nothing more exhilarating than pulling off a botched stealth mission when you know you should have failed ten times over. Payday 2 found a way to balance fun and challenge. It is why I will probably still fire it up on occasion. I will promise you this, I will never spend a penny on the micro-transactions that have destroyed a wonderful community.  Perhaps one day Overkill will backpedal and try to make amends for its massive blunder until then they will remain a developer that told bold face lies and willingly ripped a dedicated fan base to shreds. Perhaps one day the fans that made the franchise a success will return. Until then Payday 2 will be the Wild West of free weekenders and pay to winners with a sprinkling of vets that despite their disgust can't walk away from a game they once loved. ",-1

"Metaphors Are Everywhere  Gameplay: 16/25 Graphics: 23/25 Sound 24/25 Story: 23/25  Overall: 86/100  First off, this game is short, really short, it's like a teaser to the next short installment of the game. So, the gameplay is basically you just walk around and ... that's about it. You walk around with a couple little mini-games here and there. The graphics are pretty nice and I'm always glad to see an RPG Maker game that uses it's own graphics and not the ones that come with the program. The sound is really good as well and again, glad to see that their was a custom soundtrack and everything. As for the story, there is no dialogue whatsoever in this game, so you just have to assume what's going on from the implications that are present. For me, it's what made the game, I would've been bored out of my mind if I didn't feel like the storytelling was so good and enthralling. Worth the price even if it is a bit short.",1
worst game I have ever played hands down...,-1
"Great strategy board game. Sometimes feels a tad slow because theres so much content in the game. Mixes card playing aspects nicely for battle mechanics.   Haven't been able to play online (keep getting bumped) but not sure if mac and pc matchmaking exists, as I've been playing on the go on a macbook, not on my main PC.   Props on the art style, as it's super well done. Character animations for battle scenes can get somewhat repetitive, but it's more about the journey towards being the king and killing everyone/thing in your path. The AI is fairly good, so don't assume you'll always win. It's a slow burn to win, but enjoyable none the less. Multiplayer against friends is probably even more fun.   Worth checking out if you're into strategy/board/card playing games.",1
I often turn to games that start with 'Sid Meier's' when looking for an entertaining stategy game. Ace Patrol is not the worst Sid Meier's game I've ever played but it does have it's flaws. This game was originally developed as a mobile game and was mostly intended for tablet users. Now that it has been ported without any real enhancments for the PC version it doesn't feel complete. It's a very simple strategy game but the reasons it's simplistic feels like they were intented to improve / simplify mobile gaming and controls. It's not a bad game but their are a lot of other options for PC that would be more rewarding in the stategy department. I'm not recomending this game over all but I will say that it is very cheap and if you are just trying to kill 15 minutes it's not a bad choice. If you have the option to buy the mobile version that may be a better choice.,-1
So I bought this game Got into a match with a friend Took 1 step out of hole I spawned in Game ends in draw 19/18 would draw in 5 seconds again,1
"Ok, so its not perfect. Yes there are bugs. Yes there are FPS issues. Pathfinding/AI is utter rubbish!  So?  It was a grand undertaking to try and remake one of the best known sim/strategy games of its time. I wasted days playing the original Carrier Command on the Atari 520STE.  I was thrilled when I learned of this remake, but cautious as well.  This game is great! I have enjoyed taking the Manta's for flyby's and the walrus' for joyrides. I kill things because they're on MY island! Its great!  If there are two things I dislike about this game (and I can overlook a lot of things) its:  1. No Jump Button  2. Cannot BUILD bases (at least not so far as I've seen)  That’s it. Neither of which are deal breakers.  And to all those complaining about the 'Campaign'? Its a tutorial. Its to teach you the basics of the strategy game. Thats all. It was never meant to be perfect. But its better than a 'Im your commanding officer, and Im going to teach you how to use the mouse pointer to select a unit' type tutorials.  Its a fun game, that’s all. Just a game that brings flooding back memories of yesteryear with much upgraded graphics.  I hope that the dev's fix the few major bugs, but all in all, I like it :)  Easily an 8/10, but if they fix the AI and framerate issues, then it would make this a 10 in my books.",1
Game Devs put more time into adding DLC then changing the actual gameplay of maps and finetuning things. The game is much more grind heavy than it used to be. The DLC costs an arm and a leg and a couple weeks of doing the same thing to unlock it all.,-1
"The game is still as fun as I remember it was 10 years ago.  A classic FPS with a bit of a cheesy/cliche story that will test your abilities to plan ahead in battle (or spam quick save/reload)!  Go buy it, if you're a fan of HARD shooters. Graphics are also pretty good, amazing for something that's 10 years old (at the time of writing)!   Other pros include: - a semi-open world, you can explore all you want but you won't gain anything from it (at least I didn't find anything).  - some pretty funny one liners from enemies at times, you   will   be that guy in the shirt, whose ♥♥♥ is surely grass by now.   - a somewhat creepy/scary atmosphere at times.  - overall hardness of the game. It's quite hard, mailny because the enemies have laser guided x-ray targeting that could even spot you if you were behind a brick wall on mars.  - no uplay!!!     '...the guy in the shirt!'/10",1
"Simple, yet really captivating roguelike point'n'click.  Though don't be fooled by it's simplicity - game's plot and usage of it's mechanics gets deeper and deeper as you go down the stairs of the Skyhill hotel...",1
"Extremely boring- sadly never recieved my refund for this as well. The mechanics are poor, and overall it is just a lifeless game.",-1

do you think payday 2 is good game? no. payday the heist is the best robbing simulator,1
"Ok so, my friends saw this game and were all like, damn this ♥♥♥♥ looks dope! So they bought it and made me buy it. We downloaded and launched the game, and then realized there wasn't a ♥♥♥♥ing party system. I immediatly uninstalled and am now way too lazy to get a refund. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself devs. Its a shame cause it looks like an enjoyable game",-1
Best. Puzzle Game.EVER....... nuff'said. Highly recommened to use a walkthrough though.,1
"Not a bad Dinosaur Horde Survival game, but for $1, its a steal of a game! Definitely get it, since its one buck.",1
"Extremely fun game I've had it for a couple days now, I didn't buy the global megalord edition but even the regular version is great! It's totally worth the $14. the only thing i would want is more missions!",1
"Unlike other games in the visual novel genre, this one has gameplay.",1
"Definitely a dying game which should be revived by having a third game released.  Praying to Gaben that he will.  With the dying community it has, it can be boring after a while.",1
"Gunpoint is a 2-D stealth game were you take on the role of a freelance agent in a dark city were guns are outlawed, you have to help him prove his innocence from a crime he didnt commit with the help of two competing componies and must make a though choice in the end to prove wether its better to take revenge or to forgive, though with each gain comes at a equal cost. So the best question to ask is, is it worth the cost?",1
"Just bought this game so i dont have a lot of hours. So far im a tad bit disappointed. I've played Asylum and Arkham City and they were great. Both are on my top games list and i would recommend them to anyone. Now i dont remember anyone in the game losing memory of everything but it seems like they did, all of them. a lot of characters dont remember important people to the story like the joker. Im not sure if this game takes place before a certain time or if i missed something in the precious game? other than that the only other issue i have is the repetitiveness of some parts. Other than that its a great game. new story, some new characters it plays the same as the other games which can be good or bad depending if you were expecting a different playing game. All in all the game is great if you enjoyed the previous games. If you were thinking of buying this game just because it looked good, look for a different game, for now.",1
"Fun game to play, Got lots of great memory's from this game while i stull was playing on the console.",1
"Too money-hungry to bear. You unlocked a new character? Oh yay- oh nevermind, I have to pay for it. You unlocked a new class? Oh- Nope, still have to pay money for it. Want to do anything else besides grinding early-game stuff? Too bad. You have to pay for all of that.",-1
It was ok.,1
It's fun.  Maybe not that fun. But there's no gambling so 11/10   Edit: Crates and Keys have been added.  0/11,1
Worst Port EVER!  Doesn't work!,-1
"Not Lord of the Rings game you ve been waiting for. Levels are linear and focused on combat. Also you can play as elven mage and LotR purists might find it weird. But the premise that there were some conflicts up north in Middle Earth is interesting and also story, though not great, is not entirely stupid. The game overall is best experienced when playing coop with friends. Orcs need killing once again.",1
"This game is Half-Life with a plot twist. Your not playing as Adrain Shepard or Gordon Freeman, you play as Barney Calhoun a Security Guard at the Black Mesa Research Facillity. It's very fun and I like how it's interwined with OF and Half-Life aswell. The Only downside is it's not in Source but Gold Source was still okay! I recommend this game!",1
Black Ops 2 was Better but still a good game.,1
The only people I would recommend this game to are my enemies.,-1
"This game way is much more than I thought it was going to be. At first glance it looks like some girly game only a weeabo or a girl would play, but I was wrong. Comparing this game to Princess Maker is actually insultng. There is much more depth and much more outcomes that can happen based on what you leveled up in. The fine details of the story are easily forgotten but the gist of the story is easy enough to understand. The game takes roots from magical girl culture from Japan with a basic RPG system. If you love exploring new outcomes and experimenting different ways of trying to acomplish something this is the game for you. The game is VERY slow paced and there is no gameplay to speak of; basically like a visual novel. I highly reccommend this game to anyone into visual novels or likes games where you take your time like turn based games like Civ. 5. There isn't too much or any fast faced action if you were hoping for that.",1
"Superb game, the style of this game is like GTA, open world and causing mayhem, the difference with this is its just plain crazy, its more sci-fi and funky than GTA, and way less serious.  You would spend hours of fun on this once you got into it, the funny dialog and scenes, the crazy weapons and vehicles, you can customize everything, guns, cars, your charactor, its really good. Overall, consider this GTA on crack, and maybe some mushrooms thrown in there too haha, awesome!",1
"  I have been hosting Jackbox Party Pack games for my group of friends on Skype for some time, so one of them bought me the third instalment to host for us too. I would fully recommend this game if you enjoy casual fun with friends and the irreverent sense of humour YDKJ is famous for.  As with the original Party Pack, all of these games are played with shared view of the host's display, using smartphones or other input devices to play through jackbox.tv. Only one player, the host, needs to own the game.    Trivia Murder Party   The highlight of the new pack for us! Horror and trivia combine with magnificent style and ingenuity. The narrator has a deep, modified-by-synthesizer voice and plays the role of a bizarre serial killer guiding you through trivia and mini-games with your life on the line. He is capricious, and won't necessarily tell you all the rules, but is kind of adorable in his special, twisted way. The trivia is often obscure and the challenges difficult. When only one player remains alive, the final round can be played, and the survivor and the ghosts of his dead companions race for the exit, for only one can leave alive, and it might not be the one who started that way.    Tee K.O.   Continuing on from the legacy of Drawful and Quiplash, this game involves a lot of simple creativity. Draw some designs, then write a bunch of disconnected slogans to create the content for your game. Everyone gets dealt a few designs and slogans and has to choose their favorite pairing. Those selected compete in a challenge gauntlet for votes from all players. If you design a t-shirt you would be proud to wear, you can actually order it printed. The artwork resources for this one are really neat, with sixteen pretty awesome T-shirt designer characters.    Guesspionage   Select your character and prepare to make judgements about what percentage of people have three or more old phones in their houses, or own a dog, or virtually anything else. When the acting player makes their guess, every other player can get points for correctly guessing whether the real number is higher or lower than the guess. The closer you get to the true percentage, the more points you get. This is a neat game, but I find it kind of baffling and I wish it was more clear what pool of people the questions are about.    Fakin' It   My group can't play this game, because it requires all being in the same room, which we are not. In essence, the game will tell every player except one to do something like raise their hand if something is true, or point at something that fits a description. The player who recieved no instructions has to watch everyone else and try to hide the fact that they have no idea what the question was.    Quiplash 2   My group has not yet played this game, but we played the hell out of the original, a party game where responses to prompts are faced off against one another for votes, not unlike Tee K.O. The ability to write your own sets of prompts for this game is a welcome addition to the sequel and I look forward to seeing it in action.",1
"Amazing game would fully recomend it, only thing i would like to see added is a touch screen mode :D",1
"Having never played the original DotA or League of Legends, I happened upon this game in my library and was originally going to just ignore it and play TF2.  However, I decided to install it and give it a try....well needless to say, I'm hooked. This is easily one of the most awesome, strategic games out there.  The fact that Valve took it over and made it incredibly similar to TF2 (backpack, cosmetic items, using item rarities from TF2 such as Strange, Genuine, Unusual, Vintage)....well I don't pay much attention to that stuff because I get so easily lost in gameplay and completely forget about HATS HATS HATS.  The inclusion of the ability to watch live tournaments is just plain awesome and it's the type of thing I would normally avoid, but I find myself unable to stop watching live tourneys just to see what the 'pros' do, so I can hopefully pick up some skills myself.  If I had to give anyone three words of advice, those words would be PLAY. THIS. GAME.",1
"This version of SF is very lite on content and gameplay modes in comnparison to previous incarnations. That said, it has good graphics and the combat system and controls are solid.  This game was a splatter of crap at release time and I could not recommend it to anyone.  At this point, some months later, most of the worst issues are fixed, there is some meat to the gameplay and the chracter roster is starting to shape up, so now I will recommend it :)",1
"Another phenomenal master piece by Devolver whom worked on Hotline Miami, Hotline Miami 2, Broforce and Shadow Warrior. A very fell put together game. Enter The Gungeon is a rogue like retro bullet hell, and one of the best more interesting bullet hell's out there. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoyed hotline miami or any bullet hell.",1
I've only played it for a little bit. The game is pretty decent.,1
"Buys game for promised 'free' DLC, game makes super exspensive terrible DLC",-1
10/10 Just a great game....,1
Aweome game. The saddest part is this game is so fun that I haven't finished any other game in last 2 years.,1
Has to be one of the greatest Coop games that there is !,1
Quite possibly the best game ever made. Easily enters top 10 games ever. The level of detail is amazing.,1
"Until they fix float fishing (they say they did but they didnt) and now the latest patch that breaks the drag settings, I cannot recommend this game to anyone and suggest noone to buy it at this current time. If they ever bother to fix these issues i will consider changing my review.",-1
"Sorry, i tried to like this game... But, there is no deepth... One you played 10 minutes, you have experienced all you can in this game.. No real upgrades, no real challenge, just a repetitive original card roguelike. However, the art direction and the concept are damn good and attractive, but do ot expect too much from this game",-1
"There really aren't too many co-op games in the vein of Left 4 Dead, and Vermintide is definately a worthy addition. The free Quest &amp; Contracts dlc added some more control to looting (which - to be fair - can still be pretty RNG) and motivation to fire up the game daily.",1
propa mint game hew,1
Love this game!,1
"If you enjoy portal but found it to linear for a second play thought, Antichamber is the game for you. Instead of just using the mechanics for portals to traverse a test chamber. In Antichamber, you must navigate a maze of diverse rules and requirements to advance deeper into the logic and intuition that inhabits this game.",1
Fun game. Perfect to play with friends.,1
"A fun combination of 80% Sim City and 20% Age of Empires in a futuristic setting.  It's a fairly complex game (~30 resources instead of the 6 in AoE) with nuances I'm still learning 50 hours in, which keeps it interesting (alongside the persistent career point system).  As for the negatives, all Ubisoft-via-Steam games I've played thus far (HoMM, Child of Light, and now Anno), the version u-play it installs seems to crashes on boot. Every time I install an Ubisoft game, I have to go to Ubisoft's website and hunt down the download link to the latest version. After that it's fine.  The other downside is that all games last between 2-10 hours, and it's *really* hard to save and put down the game. The in-game assistant reminds you to take a break every 2 hours, but if you stop, you'll forget all the details about that production chain or trade route you were trying to set up!",1
WARNING : This game is highly addictive so dont sue them if you dont see the sun for a couple of weeks   haha i remember when the first rocket league ( otherwise known as 'Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battlecars' yup thats a mouth full ) and i always used to play split screen with my friends and family ahhh good times and now it back and iv been playing it too much :3,1
I've had so much damn good fun with this game,1
Legendary game. Recomended. Little polish to iterface needed. Campaign deck... cant be little better.,1

"  Played this during the Free Weekend. I had it on my wishlist for a long time, but did not want to commit any money to it because of the negative feedback it's gotten.  The game usually runs at a nice frame rate on High quality (GTX 980 Ti, i7, 8 GB RAM) but there are microstutters or uneven frame timings that make the game seem choppier than the frame rate suggests. Ultimately I couldn't even finish the first real mission because the game kept reproducibly freezing at a particular checkpoint, so I can't recommend this to anyone.",-1
Thew first ep was way better than I expected! :D,1
"Its Doom, cant go wrong with this true classic!",1
I know it doesn't have co-op but whatever it is a good 2D fighter and if you are into these games it is a good starter to learning the system.,1
"If you liked and or are addicted to Diablo III, I garuntee that you'll become addicted to this as well. I've only played 96 minutes so far, but I plan on continuing my journey through the game itself. Blows me away that it's completely free! Great indy game, easy controls, great vocal acting, great story (so far) and great graphics. I've been looking for a game like this for a while now, and I'm just glad I've found it. Overall, so far, I give this a 9.5/10",1
"This game is brutal, unforgiving, and ruthless. 10/10 would buy again.   My three survivors are trying to live in a shelled out building. Katia, Bruno, and Pavel.   Day 5. An older man knocks on the door of my building, asking for refuge. I agree to let him in as I figure another addition to the crew is always welcome and we have resources to spare.   Night 5. Katia goes out on a trade mission to the soldiers in the Northern part of town. She trades moonshine, coffee and smokes in return for building supplies. The only weapon the group owns - A small kitchen knife - is left with the remaining refugees in case of an attack. Pavel guards the door while Anton the new guy and Bruno the cook sleep.   Day 6. Katia returns home to find bandits raided it. Pavel didn't stand much of a chance, he was wounded. All their food is lost. The group is sad, Bruno hasn't had a smoke in six days and the wear of withdraw is creeping up on him.    Night 6. Anton goes on a raid. Nothing of worth is found except a shotgun, some shells, and a few herbs.   Day 7. The lack of food is hitting the group hard. Pavel is recovering slowly from his wounds, Bruno is becoming sick and depressed from withdraw. Katia and Anton are tired from having to take shifts sleeping and clearing out the building because Pavel is recovering in the other bed.   Night 7. Katia goes on a raid to a small apartment complex owned by an eldery couple and their son. She knows the building is locked and the man probably has a gun for looters, so she takes the shotgun hoping she can just take enough food and not have to use it. She's up the side, in through a window and halfway to the kitchen when she hears the old woman scream for help. Katia panics and fires on the old woman, killing her. The woman's husband hears the shots and runs. She fires again, injuring him. The young man yells in horiffic surprise, his parents gunned down. He's running up the stairs with his own shotgun. Katia fires twice, killing the man and taking his gun. She pulls out a crowbar and kills the old man so he can't run for help.  Before the shock of what has happend hits her, Katia has 4 cans of meat, 5 bits of raw meat, and enough medical herbs and bullets for her compatriots to last until next week.   Day 8. Katia returns home. She opens the door to the building and collapses to her knees. 'How can I live with myself. I killed those innocent people.' she cries. Bruno comes up and tries to comfort her but he fails. She's 'broken'. On the verge of suicide over her actions, and the consequences have effected the whole group. Their all 'sad' and it affects the way they act. Bruno makes hot food for the group. They may all die, but it won't be of hunger.   Day 15. Katia finally gets over the worst of the depression, and the group is back to normal. They haven't gone hungry thanks to the moonshine stills upstairs which provide enough alcohol to trade to the soldiers for food and bullets, but the house still has a long way to go to become defensible.   Night 15. Katia raids 'sniper's junction'. Intel says it's completely safe, but other refugees say otherwise. Arriving, two things greet her; A refugee's wounded screams and sniper fire in the distance. She makes her way to the wounded man, taking cover behind blown out cars. In between sniper shots and the man's cries of agony he begs for his help. Several sniper bullets and a few minutes later and she opens a sewer grate for the man. His relief and gratitude is shown as he asks her to follow him back to his flat. She escorts the now hobbling man back to his home. They enter to the sound of a screaming baby 'I'm home Jacob' cries the man, hugging the infant. 'I have everything we need and I promise I won't leave you again' He tells her he wishes he could do more for her, but she is welcome to all the contents of the box under the bed in the next room. Katia enters the bedroom and opens the box - filled with jewlry. 'Thank you again, I don't know how I would have survived without you' the man says as Katia heads home.   This is not a story, these are actual events within the game. Killing innocents has effects on your survivors, they aren't soldiers after all and sometimes they can't cope with killing. Sometimes refugees become sad, or depressed. They can become suicidal or become prone to fits of rage against their fellows. They can freeze to death, get killed on raids, starve or die of sickness. But they can also become happy, even if only for a short while. They can build gardens, stills, read books and help other people and families. Every action has a reaction.",1
Does what it promised; finally delivering the RCT fans a worthy successor with creative freedom. I can't tell you anything about the campaign because I've spend all my hours creating parks in Sandbox Mode. It shows that the developers had a lot of fun making this game and that they are listening to the great and growing community behind it. We've waited for this game for so long and it's finally there.,1
"Really good game, i have over 500+ hrs played and still cant stop playing it. If you're thinking of buying this game get it. you wont regret it .",1
"A good little game for a small price, reminds me the good old Waverace 64.  Pros :  - the price - nice, colorfull graphics - several jets to buy, upgrade and customize - you can choose the gender of your pilot - not too difficult, not too easy - new stunts to unlock with a level progression  Cons :  - dubstep stuck in your head - only a few races that become repetitive - your upgrades matter more than your skill - no vertical control of the jet - too short",1

"Just a great WW2 fps shooter game , with a lot of diversity in it...",1
"Very grindy, you'll be waiting a while until you get some good equipment and weapons, but once you do, the game becomes somewhat fun, it's good if you're into grindy games. You also have the option to speed things up with some real currency, but it's a tad bit overpriced for a free to play game, worth checking out none the less.",1
"A great game for 5 dollars, a garbage one for 15. Get it when it's cheap and you'll have a great time.",1
"Pros:  -Game's pretty, models are fairly well-animated. -Premise is interesting. -Music's fairly decent, both in ambience and otherwise.  Cons: -Too short. Game can be finished in three hours, even if you take your time and search for secrets. Sure, you can replay it, but there's not much reason to. -Too easy. No enemy in the game is very threatening - guards can be stunned from a distance and are terrible at pathing around obstacles.  -Boss fights are outrageously simple. Wait for specific timing, pick up projectile, hurl at boss, repeat. Only time I died was when I fell into a pit after a fight had ended, and that was because of wonky platform hitboxing. -Puzzles aren't difficult or complex or even interesting - hope you like the ol' switch-puzzle sewer-pipe-puzzle light-mirror-puzzle cliches, because that's all you'll get. -The physics-manipulation-mechanic is a gimmick. I wish I'd just been given a stun gun and the ability to pick items up and carry them above my head, because they'd have the same utility - and be a lot easier to use. -Story is cliched and uninteresting. Try to guess what's going to happen next in the plot, and ninety percent of the time you'll be right. 'No, vaguely-threatening mustached-man, I'm VERY convinced that that was an accident and you're distraught about my near-death.' -Voice acting ranges from ok to awful. And somebody's always yammering in your ear.  All in all, this might be worth it if it were on sale for $5. At $15 it just isn't, unless you really are so starved for interesting graphics that you can muddle through the mediocrity of... everything else.",-1
"good adventure game, plenty of hours fun",1
i mean its a fun game only if you have a lot of friends to play it with.,-1
"This game is a strange mixture of Black-Ops Zombies and Minecraft. While it doesn't capture the essence of either incredibly well, it does offer a reasonable amount of challenge and content for the price (Currently $2). It is NOT the sort of game that you will play obsessively and over and over again, but if you have a buddy or two you can expect at least an afternoon's worth of fun. The co-op aspects of this game are the best thing about it, and the graphics are acceptable. The key to enjoying it is to not expect it to be deep or have a long play-life. Rather, it is an entertaining way to kill and afternoon or two without demanding too much brainpower, and therefore provides a relief from either game that it gets its inspiration from. 7/10.",1
"Missing is a game of puzzles, and some quick mouse clicking at certain times. This is woven within video to draw the player in. It switches between the main character and a detective trying to solve the killings that have been occurring.   The puzzles are not difficult, but some will keep you guessing unless you watch everything; there is a solution nearby always.  For less than the cost of a soda or coffee, it kept me entertained, and sounds like it will be fun. I'd recommend it to my friends. Heck, just the video alone was worth it.",1
At fist I thought it was just a joke but then it got good and then she dumped me.,1

"It's actually a very clever concept for a PC game--just poor execution. They've tried to create a game where the mouse acts like a Wiimote and you use it to directly control a flail attached to a flying machine. It kind of works, but a mouse is really too clumsy to be whipping around in continuous circular motions--it just feels unnatural.",-1
"This is a good game, in the beautiful legend with a butcher and four hanhou steal a thief in the story, the atmosphere of the game play is very good, in the game to kill time, every day with friends open black, very unique idea, a survival game, gameplay is very strong, but the optimization to improve step by step, the equivalent of reality version of the hide and seek, this game is fun.",1

"Despite a rocky launch, Rome II in its current state, Patch 15 aka the 'Emperor Edition', is a phenomenal entry to the Total War franchise. The scale and size of the battles in the game is unprecedented and dwarfs Shogun 2. The AI, after a multitude of patches, finally feels like it should: intelligent. Enemy armies and fleets will react accordingly to your flanking manoveurs and reinforce choke points during siege battles instead of blindly charging towards their own slaughter. The AI also acts responsively outside of battle, every turn sending you a number of potential treaties and bargains in return for payment, diplomatic support, and/or military aid. With that being said, one should not limit themselves purely to the vanilla base game as the very prevalent modding community has truly turned the game into something special. In particular, I recommend Radious for providing overhaul enhacements. Also, while it is unfortunate that we live in an age where half of a game's content seems to be restricted for purchase later via dlc, several of Rome 2's expansions are worth a look as well, but, to be quite honest, so far my favorite campaign has been the Imperator Augustus free LC that's included with the newly released Emperor Edition! To sum it up, Rome II has finally become the game it should have been at launch and is well worth your time if you're a fan of Strategy games and/or the classical time period. Roma Invicta!",1
"So far, really good first impression. I really want to explore more though I would prefer normal game cues vs the obvious 'go here' early on. Yeah, it requires a bit more effort but it's worth it to the player. (ask Valve about phenomenal player cueing and manipulation).   On Vive, very underutilized and shoddy controls by default. I hope that clumsiness changes or we can customize them outright on our hand controllers because with intuitive controls it could be tremendous but the way they have them now is ... irritating at best.  Really looking forward to playing this more (despite the awful Vive controls).",1
 Why buy this game?  Buy this game if you want to:    Learn to park properly in Euro Truck Simulator 2   Learn to park well in American Truck Simulator.   Become more proficient at parking a real tractor trailer  ,1
"Yet another excellent puzzle game, even better than the first game. It's just as challenging as the first, and about just as long. There's a lot more environments that are visually impressive and pretty to look at, and the sound design is amazing; solving the puzzles feels really satisfying because of it. The story is wrapped up pretty nicely as well, which is something I wasn't really expecting.  I would recommend buying this at full price. Fireproof Games deserves it, and the game is just pure gold.",1
"tbh i have had this game for over 2 years (as of writing this rewiew) so i have had it for a pretty long time. And this game is actually really fun, but the only issue i have with the game is that there are too many dlc's. instead of updating the game like csgo they are just going to make it to an dlc. overall ill give it a strong 7/10",1
Great game! should be pay to play!,1
"I say 'yes' for this game. Great story, multiplayer looks pretty fun and no FPS drops. I`d like games about future and in this year DEV have created very cool game.",1
"This is the most addicting game ever, I love it. Great music, great levels, and great things to unlock. There's so much to this game and there is definetly more to come. I highly recommend it, especially if you love games that go with the beat.",1

"I've got what I payed for. After launch I had 2 game breaking BUGS. 1 I couldnt start game at all and second when I somehow managed to start the game in multiplayer everybody always left.  This two problems were fixed for me 3 days after a release.  Game runs smoothly, I didn't have a single crush or any problems. Multiplayer is great, campaign is super cool not like GTA IV. I am really happy I bought this game.  PROS: Controls, Settings, Graphics, Music, dialogues everything is great. Even options that if you fail mission and you cant pass it, you can skip it. AWESOME You have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of guns you can upgrade, same with vehicles and clothing. People say there is nothing to do in this game, well you might try ONLINE. There is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of them.  CONS: When you in game and it is in lobby with other players or you spectate and you wanna use CHAT you cant because when you use letter that is key-bind it will be accepted as command. To be honest, map is bit empty when you drive in desert or so, sometimes you can experience RANDOM EVENT tho which is nice.   Online is awesome ( those hackers people mention is something I experienced ONCE ). Keep updating new cars, weapons, and this small stuff but also content which adds new ways and options of playing.   Rating 9,75/10   CONS &lt; PROS   BUY !  Enemy organization of 4 got dominated by me alone. Got kicked because they wanted to farm and I kept destroying their cargo and killing them. This should be fixed somehow.",1
Okey game with the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and greedy dev ever,-1
Classic! I love it,1
Where's stealth?                                                     Oh. This isn't PayDay 2...,1
"Half-Life is a FPS, but not a average FPS, this game brings in shooting and platforming at the right times, sometimes managing the jumping puzzles can be hard, even when the answer is in plain sight and hard to see, completing it feels satisfying. The game can be difficult espically at times when coming to some parts (unless your on easy) making that feel good when you complete it too. The soundtrack is a good part of this game too, and by good, I mean amazingly good. Some of my favorite songs in the game are the following: Hazardous Enviroments, Nuclear Mission Jam, Klaxon Beat, Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar, and Jungle Drums. Overall, being one of the best (and first!) Valve Software games ever, this game gets a 9/10.  [EDIT 3/13/2015]  Just to convince you even more how good this game is, i'm gonna list some mods for this game.  CRACK-LIFE Play through a skinned Half-Life game to make it feel like you're on crack.  SVEN-COOP Have you ever wanted to play Half-Life or it's expansions with your friends? Well now you can with this mod! And not only do you get the campaign support, you also get custom maps too! Plus, you can play Crack-Life with it!  I'll add more later.",1
"i can just say that this game is hilarious, and pretty fun! the battle dynamics, combat system is pretty much entertaining, i have not had this relastic battles in any other game, if you really want to enjoy this game, get a good computer, play it at EXTREME settings, and you should addict it , as i did.... what about the multiplayer? Co-op campaign is EXTREMLY AMAZING; the online battle is excitement but CA have to improve it much more to reach the completion, there's no more bugs noticed anymore... highly recommended.",1
"When the game isn't crashing, it is stuttering worse than an autistic kid watching sonic.  Also, instead of fixing said issues, they went full EA and added microtransactions.  1/10, and only cos you can slide up stairs, do not buy.",-1
one of the best games ever just like tf2 but new and awesome weapon customization ,1
"It is good but 3 bad things Bad detail,some zombies are almost impossible to kill,and anime and this does not mix",-1
great game finally someone to make an original free fps game with multiple gamemodes it requires teamwork only if the spray patterns were bigger this game would be perfect!,1
"First of, I love this game, all the variety and nudges to older games. That said, for the difficulty settings, what the game is sorely lacking is 'just let me through this mechanic' difficulty setting. Would it be cheatin? Maybe yes if you leave it on through the game. The only one missing then is the player though. But hate being permanently stuck in a geme mechanic mode I just can't pass.  Edit:  I have to say the ridiculous fighting mechanic in the volcano island has made me absolutely hate the game.",-1
Vetmry fun especially to animal lovers but requires patience.,1
"Seems so far almost the same as the webversion. To bad i have to start over. But fun to do inbetween for some reason Especialy if u start with a small group at same time and see who grows the fastest.!  i hope in future with any of these games. Make option for multiplayer.  Like join a lobby with 2-10 players 100x speed 1 hour. Top earner in 1 hour wins. No spend allowed.  Also a Ranking with category cash spend/ Total score prem player/ Total score free player/ most clicks done.  I donno something like that woud if u ask me make it from a funny but well no aim game. towards who knows some sort of a new casual genre ^^  The rankings can increase your earnings/ingame spending greatly and for us players make it fun to compare certain category's   These games are in a way kinda fun to see how far you can push yourself to go. However it feels there missing something. It feels as a singleplayer but with no aim. ? Beeing able to compare can change this.  Anyways go squeeze lemons, Costumers and your empire are waiting!",1
"I bought this game today and I've completely fallen in love with it, I really want to play all night but work is in the way. This game has everything you need in order to build your perfect dream city! You can choose if you want a smoke ban and electricity cheap city etc etc etc. It really has everything and you can build some really cool stuff! 10/10, you should buy it even if you don't like sim city games!",1
"I really wanted this to be like the old game Dungeon Keeper. It isn't.  Unfortunatly it doesn't bring anything else to the game either, so this feels like a waste of money.",-1
better than that other parkor game that ea made....BECUASE IT'S FREE AND BETTER IN EVERY OTHER WAY,1
"If you have never played this game before, you are not a person... (10/10)",1
"Easily the best Vampire: The Masquerade cRPG available to date. I've played through this game numerous times and have thoroughly enjoyed it each and every time. It's a little dated (using the Half-Life 2 engine), but is still very playable with the community patches  (http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647/61625/61626/description) . The only real disappointment with the Steam release is that it is 100% broken out of the box on modern systems and the patch removed the steam features like achievements. Despite that I'd totally recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid story driven cRPG or who is a fan of Vampire: The Masquerade",1
"I really liked this game, to be honest I died playing against the computer at least 20 times before looking online for tips. Once I understood the food/science focus of the game I found it quite easy. Very fun to play with my brothers on LAN.  The game can be played many different ways, try to build super battle ships and wipe out the other races or build up a massive trade network and buy your way to winning. It is completely up to you.  It's great fun but when playing for 5-6hours to be defeated in 10 minutes can really annoy you.  Story N/A Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 6/10 Uniqueness 7/10  Overall: 7/10",1
"With the 2.0 Patch, the game now looks great and plays great! This is my favourite RTS game now, and I've stopped playing other games (Starcraft 2 etc.) just to play this.",1
"When you start this game you have a simple command. 'Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt'. And before long you will be drawn into the thrilling, intriguing, memorable and amazing story. That is BioShock Infinite. Through out the game there is a sense of mystery, until the end. Where your whole world gets fliped up side down. With simple mechanics, Bioshock Infinite is a must play. So I leave you with the words of The Prophet, Comstock.  'One man goes into the waters of baptism, a different man comes out, born again. But who is that man who lies submerged? Perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint, until he is revealed unto the eyes of man.'  Have an amazing day!",1
Im not impressed.,-1
"Garry's mod is a sandbox game where you have fun with characters from other games. Garry's mod is most fun with a friend on an online server. But, the only way to get the full experence is by getting stuff from the workshop. So, if you arn't the type of person to do that, then this game isn't really for you. But, I highly recomend that alot of people should get this game for some laughs and just for have a good time. My rating for this game would be a 9.4 Out of 10.",1
"this game doesn't have very many memes. but, other than that; 's a pretty good game.",1
"Funny I should stumble on this game Max, since not long ago I had posted in a forum thread discussing games like Another World (Out of this World) and Heart of Darkness. Everybody was wishing HoD would come to steam. After playing this demo (and thank you whoever for putting a demo of this up and making it only $2.99 during the steam sale this year!!) I had to have it.   Just over an hour play at this moment (I know, not enough for a proper review) I felt compelled to review it in hopes others will see it in time to play the demo and see how good it is. The cartoonish visuals are excellent and feel familar to any fan of kid's animation. Don't let that stop you though. It starts casual but started to get tougher at about the 1 hour mark for me, in world 2. My favorite thing might be the sound and specifically the voice work. First rate! Max is very vocal the whole way through and it adds enormously to the whole experience, along with the music.   It's been years for me and HoD, so it's hard to properly compare the 2 games without going on an exhaustive hunt for the game disc. But that game immediately came to mind while watching the opening cutscene. Pretty sure it would have even if I hadn't been discussing that old game.   Only slightly over an hour in and this is great fun in short doses. Highly impressed. But even at $2.99 play the demo first to see if the difficultly level is right for you. It does start pretty easy.",1
"*pushes away all the bad reviews of this game*  Now that's out of the way, let me tell you, as a HUGE Megaman fan for years now, this collection is a great one. Other reviews are claiming it's a cash grab, or that it's a cheap version of the Anniversary Collection back over a decade ago, I want to elaborate that this game is Megaman 1-6 on a DIFFERENT ENGINE. Capcom designed an entire new engine and decided to port over Megaman 1-6, this means that's the reason why they didn't include Megaman 7, 8 or etc. Is this bad? Not at all.   This collection is an excellent collection of the classic 8-bit games that were on the NES. These are *NOT* emulated ports, these are the original games recreated on the NEW engine. This could mean Capcom is planning a Megaman revival soon, who knows. But I digress, this doesn't mean the game is bad. While yes, it may suffer from some input lag, it's nothing to fuss over. This game is an excellent addition to anyone who enjoyed the Megaman games from their childhood or anyone who's an entry level into the megaman series. The fact they included a remix mode and an online leaderboard really drives home for veterans of the series who are looking for a further challenge. In addition, the artwork and early sketches are a nice treat as well. There's not much I can say, other than the megaman games are hard, twitchy, side scrollingly fun!  So instead of looking at those bad reviews on people claiming how cheap or bad it is, consider it from a different perspective. You really can't go wrong with a $15 collection (About $2.50 per game) that's excellently ported over to a brand new engine that still feels like you're playing on an NES, and that's saying a lot since they totally could have just straight up emulated the games.",1
"Very fun and rewarding for new fans of the Hitman franchise such as myself.  Not knowing what I was walking into when I started, I easily finished this game satisfied and contempt, eager to play more games of such a genre.",1
I've only played it for 6 minutes and even I know it's good.,1
Good game so far but got scammed by the dev's.,-1
Excellent Game. If you like to be management this is a fun one. Buy garages and manage your truck drivers!,1
"FISTFUL OF ♥♥♥♥. DAMN BECOME COWBOY ♥♥♥♥ COWS. This is the game for you, IF you want to join cowboy gang and ♥♥♥♥ like guys ♥♥♥♥in guys. I PROMISE THIS IS THE BEST COW ♥♥♥♥ING GAME I HAVE PLAYED IN WHILE. THIS HAS BEEN RODI RODRIGES TY FOR WASTING YOUR TIME",1
it is a good game but it crashes a lot so 6/10 being as they had 3 years to get it ready,1
"Warning, this will create motion sickness in people who do not suffer form motion sickness, the game doesn't offer it on it's steam page but the drug IRL DLC should add many more hours of replayablity. Steam won't sell the DLC tho so you have to find toehr people. My eyes still hurt from playing and I didn't know I was playing for 37 mionutes and no I hope wish I didn't",1
"  Conclusion: Get the BFG Edition  This game was probably epic when it came out in 2004. But for me who just tried it out I'm not very happy about it. I just tried out Doom 1 and Doom 2 (yes I am a bit late to the party), but those games were epic, fun and challenging in a good way.  Doom 3 just changes too much from the original formula - and not for the better (which is confirmed by the fact that the new Doom (doom reboot?) basically went back to the old formula and turned it up to 11. Gone are the open 'mini-arenas' where you fight hordes of enemies; difficult at times, but fair in the sense that you outrun the enemies and can take cover. Doom 3, on the other hand, just throws you into a narrow corridor, spawning enemies infront and behind you with no possibility for mobility and calls that fair?!?.   And so far, the game has not been difficult for any other reason than that you can not see your targets. That is the main killer for me with this game. So many times I've died not because the enemy would be particulary difficult to kill in itself, but when you get 0 vision, you can't aim. And that's where the BFG Edition comes in: It has a modern system with tac-lights strapped onto your gun (or yourself, whichever) and makes the game playable.  So yeah, stay away from the vanilla version and get the proper game. I'm not gonna write a more in-depth review here, since I'm moving over to the BFG edition and will review that instead.",-1
"♥♥♥♥ing Uplay, never get this game",-1
The graphics are fun and creative and so is the game. It may be good for little children but it is very short and only has 4 'locations'. You can beat the game in 30 mins or less... It would be better with many more places to haunt and missions or objectives to go with them.,1
"Oh man. Just when I thought they had left the game to die they release this and give it to us for free. It is so much better than the original...and then...they give us FREE DLC to go along with it. If you are a fan of pillaging skalliwags or making sure that Spain has an incredibly hard time securing cities and trade routes in the same carribean they vastly out number everyone else in, then this game is for you.  9/10  Will be 10/10 if they continue to work on this project after this latest update and keep giving us new stuff to do.",1
This game makes me see things.,1

I say yes with a disclaimer. To truely use this for more than light school student manga your going to need to download more assets. There are web sites that have free stuff that works.  What this still needs as of my comment.  a way to creat custom poses a way to cut or trim away stuff you want to disappear.  those 2 items would greatly improve this software.,1

"After taking a look at the negative reviews on this game regarding it saying 'F2P' when they have a Guest user system which is essentially their version of 'Free Users', I don't see why you're all upset about this. The system works perfectly with the game and despite many of you saying 'You have to invest lots of cash to actually do anything', you'd be supprised if you took a look around their starter packs page and various retailers for the game (Key websites, Amazon etc), you can infact find ridiculously good deals for this title, I'll explain that further on. I myself find the game to be one of the best hunting simulators I've played in a long long time, the Cabela's series honestly has been blown away by this title and the community as it stands is in excellent condition. The game is regularly updated and despite having a few issues in the past it's turning out to be one of my all-time favourite games due to the fact that there is an unlimited amount of fun that you can have, from having hunting competitions with your friends to solo hunting in the dense forests or in the mountain peaks. The graphics and the game ballistics &amp; physics are clean and very well-done, despite having hiccups rarely with a few glitches they need to iron out you'd be supprised at how much you can actually achieve within the game. The achievement and rewards system for competitions and general milestones are another feature which adds a sense of achievement to investing your hours into the game, same with weapon skills and tracking / spotting skill levels.  On to the weapons, currency and customization within the game.    Customization  is somewhat limited due to the fact you can't swap camo's on your weapon, so the marketplace often has weapons of the same type but a different appearance. But it doesn't really matter as they share the same skills / stats aslong as they are the same model. Character appearance is another feature you can customize within the game by simply mix and matching clothing to your desire, with the wide range available it's really not that bad. As well as you can swap out clothing on different enviroment conditions or depending on what you're hunting to give better visibility and sound reduction stats.    Currency  (EM / GM) within the game is something you'd definetly expect for a game of this type. With a large multiplayer endorsement around the game I wouldn't have expected anything less than the requirement to buy different weapons, clothing and equiptment with the virtual currency, which is perfectly understandable for this title and was implemented well within the game. EM is the real-world exchanged currency where you purchase it using real-world money or you can complete surveys as an additional way of gaining it for those who can't justify supporting the title through currency purchasing. GM is the free currency which you can gain through suveys again or by completing challenges or competitions within the game, however you can purchase limited things using this currency. Honestly, despite what you guys are saying they should have no shame in calling themselves a F2P game, I've spent many hours within this game and spent what I'd say is a fairly reasonable amount on additions for the game. They offer a nice range of deals on their site for starter packs, for the price of $15 you can get almost everything you'd need to have a nice start to the game, the 12 GA Pump Action Shotgun included can hunt almost everything within the game, you gain 3 months membership and access to hunting everything and travel anywhere, as well as various other equiptment and a sidearm included. I didn't realise it before but I found various retail versions of the game available on certain retailer websites, and despite already having a membership and a nice collection of weapons, I went ahead and spent £14 on a retail key from  ♥♥♥♥♥  [uk.♥♥♥♥♥.net] , who offer a very nice retail package for this, for the price of any regular game. So what's the shame in calling this an F2P game if they give you a variety of free options, and then the ability to upgrade to a full version of the game with a membership / starter pack / retail copy for the price of any regular game? It's perfectly justified. And for those who are interested in that retail copy, it is beyond belief what you get from it and I'd highly recommend that to anyone interested in starting or continuing playing this game. It includes  6 months  membership, 7 weapons (2 shotguns, 2 sidearms, 2 rifles, 1 bow) as well as access to everything within the game and another large assortment of equiptment and callers to get you started.  (Note: One of the shotguns is an exclusive non-market shotgun too!)    Weapons  in the game are definetly very fitting for the title. The developers have kept far away from unrealistic hunting weapons, despite firearms such as AR-15's and semi-automatic rifles being used regularly in real world hunting they have taken the right desicion to not spoil the fun of hunting and keep it to a nice selection of rifles, shotguns, sidearms and bows. They even added a muzzleloader for those who want a way-back hunting expirence. Perfect matches, for a perfect game.  Overall, in my opinion the game is absolutely superb with it's stunning graphics, unbeatable realistic physics and it's very well implemented multiplayer, community and features. Definetly a 10/10 in my books, and for those upset about the pricing of things, seriously check out the retail copies and the starter packs. For the price of a regular game (Under £15) you can get everything you need to have endless hours of fun within the game.  Hopefully this was helpful, if not then I'm not sure what you were expecting from a review.  (Note: Over 100 hours on the non-steam version)   - Felix B.",1
"You know what makes a really cool game? Travelling to a different planet, exploring the ENTIRE thing and doing it seamlessly. If there's one thing that makes a space exploration game authentic in my mind, it's that everything you do is seamless. You can literally jump in your ship, point your noise toward the sky and shoot toward whatever planet you see and you'll get there with no load times. That is an experience I'm not soon going to forget and it's one that makes this a go-to game for exploration afficionados. Oh, yeah, and you can name every planet you discover whatever you want granted it passes the profanity filter built in. Yeah, I'm in.   But you can do other things. You can mine for elements that either recharge your life support and (if the planet is hostile enough) hazard suit, or use them to add upgrades to your hand-tool, ship or exosuit. Your hand-tool can be used for mining, shooting or grenade-launching (grenades actually create a hole in the ground). You can scan and discover different kinds of animals and plants and rename each of them whatever you wish. You can find alien artifacts, plaques and ruins that give you items, teach you alien languages and much more, I'm sure.  You can meet other aliens who can buy/sell to you or give you helpful items. There is a lot to do here.  The planets themselves are never the same each time you visit. Because everything is procederally generated, the land and the sites within are all randomized so, in a way, it's a little strange. But it also keeps things fresh. I haven't gotten too far but from what I've read, there are a limited number of types of planets that will be generated so maybe after some time the repetition of the types of planets may get tiresome. But, honestly, I don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ because as of now, I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing intergalactic explorer and I'm loving the hell out it. If you want to hear some criticism go read someone else because I don't intend to get mired down by nit-picky details. This game isn't perfect but it's a unique one and one that you won't enjoy unless you suspend reality and let your galactic explorer roam free.",1
"If you watched the anime and you wanna keep going on the emotional-suicide train, play this game",1
i might be bad at this game BUT i like a lot and its fun playing with friends i mean.. they always laugh at you if you fail...and you will always fail,1
Better than Diablo 3 I think.,1
"I decided to recommend this game to anyone who hasnt tried it yet, since it's the best f2p i ve played (not counting tf2, which originally wasnt f2p). I had 50 hours of online co op fun with it, more than most 'full price games' give. Try it! ",1
Really good game! Has a very unique atmosphere and cool '50s music. Quests are fun and no two buildings are the same.,1
"Do you believe in casual cruelty?  Do you believe in murder and death for the sake of honestly rather pointless goals? Do you enjoy the screams of your knights as they sacrifice themselves to your will?  Of course you do!   This amusing game centers around using the dead to help the living move forward. Often with their corpses.  There's the joy of carefully thinking through your path in order to sacrifice as few as possible, making use of timing and skills to avoid needless casualties.  There's also the joy of having a carpet of freshly dead bodies to safely and leisurely walk on as you make your way to the end.   Don't forget that murder is fun!",1

assassins creed is a great franchise and is usually very smooth with no problems (with the exception of unity) I highly recommend this game . though be prepared to get a work around because it wont start normally,1
portal 2 is an overall improvment over the first game the first game was short and sweet this one is 3x times as long the ending is also alot more then just a falling burning thing while your on the surface it still isnt as good as half lifes ending there is also a plot twist and a better final boss the new mechanics are also pretty cool some places are test chambers some are abondoned with plants growing on them the bad things is that chapters 7 and 6 suck.......oh and the music for the final boss is ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful,1
"I played this game in beta with friends, played through much of its earlier development cycle. I have occasionally popped my head back up now and again to see how things were going. The time I completely stopped was shortly after the Diamond Heist came out, but well before Dragan. I kept watching, seeing how new heists were added and more weapons introduced.  The rebalancing to experience and money was a glorious change, one I was happy about. The Train, the Armored Transports, Big Bank. All glorious, all fun. Death Wish, a challenge. One that I managed to scrape a few runs through with my friends.  However, there's a comment from Almir, back in October 2011.  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521  'We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)' [Straight from that page]  Look at it now. This update, Update 79, with the Black Market, has just released Microsanctions that hold cosmetics behind them. Not just any sort of cosmetics--cosmetics that hold stats on them, that can minorly boost your weapons. This sort of thing is not Pay Day. It is not Pay Day 2. Not the one I played for so long. Not the one I dumped long hours into back during my senior year in high school and on into the start of my college career.  With this lump of coal they've just given us all; the giant foam middle finger they've given to the community and all of their loyal customers after all these years, they have ruined much of the potential for this game. This saddens me, greatly. It was so much fun. But these actions are more than just a sour taste in my mouth. It wounds me as a member of this community to see such betrayal.  It stains the reputation of Overkill and of Almir himself. His word has been broken. Microsanctions are in the game now. And he's still with them.",-1
One of the best trial and error games. IT'S SOO GREAT,1
"SuperNeonFirstPersonSpy, like a 'Minecraftly NOLF' without guns (No One Lives Forever, game by  Monolith Productions )  Music  in this game so atmospheric:  10/10  (cuz i love stuff like this)  Gameplay :  8/10   Graphics :  WHO CARES?    Overall rating  for this unique jenre:  9/10  Nice try,  Minor Key Games , just keep it up.   Im waiting for new stuff like this",1
"Incredibly groundbreaking and thoughtful, from story to humor to soundtrack to characters this game has to be one of my favourites of all time, plus the the amazing replayability that goes beyond any game I've seen before!  also dogs",1

Community is Terrible. Gameplay servers use dial up. 0/10,1
This game is probably the coolest MMO ive ever played. I really think that this game is worth buying.,1
"Best game i ever bought. It is my most played game in my library. Would definitly recommend you buy the game if you are not into fast shooters and have lots of patience. Unfortunatly I would not get the game for 30 euro, luckly I caught the game and DLC for 7.50 in christmas sales. In my view I wouldnt pay 30 euro for the game and DLC as it is a bit steep for a game you may never get into. High risk but if it is the type of game you like then the risk was worth it. All in all would give the game 5 out of 5 but only buy on sale otherwise not really worth it!!!",1

this game......i have spent hours JUST on the visuals menu trying to configure it so i can get the best preformance and the best look of the game....i find it very frustrating to play this just because it is so badly ported to pc. now i HAVE had ALOT of fun actually playing this game it can run with great preformance but it looks like your looking through some really foggy glasses or something that's how i would describe it. the visuals on the top settings look really good but the prefomance of the game isn't good.i like this game but i would NOT recommend this to anyone in it's current form. a while down it may be a different story if the devs put some patches to fix the horrid preformence this game would be brilliant.  and i HAVE experienced crashing and such but the devs posted some fixes and it has worked so far.  I have a higher end pc and no game before has given me much if any issues but this is just SO horribly optimized for pc,-1
ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO PLAY ARMA 2? YOUR FACE CAN'T DEFLECT AWESOME OF THIS MAGNITUDE,1
Simply the game of my life.,1
WAT... Game is cool. so confused.,1
- music by Jesper Kyd - David Bateson - licensed weapons - awesome introduction before mission - weapons store - high difficulty  - no stupid storyline like in Absolution - great atmosphere of the assassination world - after almost 16 years I still love playing this game,1
Exactly what I expected.,1
A Very good game to play I say Buy this game. Good of strategy better than any other total war game befor.,1
Played the game. Discovered cake farting. 10/10 changed my life.,1

"Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this game yet. Basically, if you enjoy 2D platforming games and you haven't got this game, what are you doing? Get this game now! It has all the things which I love in a game; collection, 2D platforming, simple to learn but hard to master mechanics, replay value. This game has it all! Also, if you play with a keyboard and do well, I commend you greatly. (In other words, it's best to play with a gamepad) Overall, really great game and I've enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of it!",1
"Its ok not the worst I played yet needs some balancing still and hard to find some matches. When you get into one its actually kinda fun. Plus there are positives to the gameplay mainly how the characters move and attack and each have their own unique style of combat. Getting locked in an attack is annoying, yet you can learn to over come it depending on the character you use. I hope they add more to this game its rare to find a multiplayer, action, fighting game. Seriously balance the large guy he needs to have high flinch resistance and health.",1
"This is a beautiful game to look at, as it is fun to play. Find yourself immersed in this tropical enviromnent as you go exploring this Island. Aswell as getting the thrill and adrenaline of unexpected counters of dangerous animals, and the drug addicted disturbed rebels looking for you. You may take a stelthy or a full mayhem engage towards these badguys that will hunt you down. The cruel animals may even help you complete this task! Enjoyed both FarCry 1, 2 and now this #3. Really looking forward to the #4 and the changes it brings !",1

"What to say about FEZ that hasn't already been said...? Oh, I know.  I just watched the preview for FEZ one day and decided 'Man, this looks like the perfect game for me.' I bought it just like that and played it little by little over the course of a few days, completing the entire game, and falling in love with it in the process.  I suppose I am late to the party with this title entirely, but I can say one thing: FEZ is easily one of my favorite games in existence.  I don't know what it is about this game, but I already want to play it again. I loved the puzzles and the challenge of discovering all the anti-cubes, maps, and artifacts/relics. I really, truly enjoyed the world and the characters. Gomez is seriously the cutest little thing. If ever there was a game I could see myself playing again and again and again, FEZ is it. c:",1
"Probably the best standalone Hanafuda game I have seen. The best mobile app for hanafuda is Miyabi 花札 on the Android Play Store, which is better than this. The absoulte best is   the hanafuda minigame in the Fate Hollow/Ataraxia Visual Novel.    7/10",1

An experience that should be played twice or even more. The Witcher 2 is one of the best RPG's I have played. The story is great. The battle mechanics have greatly impoved from the first one. What I love about the Witcher is the fact is the Devs clearly made this for adults both story and interactions. I enjoyed leveling up each skill tree and I could actaully tell how it improved the character's ablities. All but few choices seams like they will bring about a different outcome with each. Overall I would give the witcher a 9.0/10 I deducted a point only because the map system in the game is ♥♥♥♥ and had me lost or mixed up at times. Now I can't wait for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,1
Very fun game! I wish there were more like it.,1
Tropico 4 is a fun game. I'm not sure why its called Tropico 4 because its the same game as Tropico 3 with a few additions (the buildings and game mechanics are exactly the same). This game is like sim city but with a more functional economy and political system that you can play with. You can play in sandbox mode or work your way through the campaign missions. Worth about $20,1
love it. Only thing wanting is ... mouse control capability.,1
this just saved me from buying a vita,1
One of the Best turn-based RTS!  ,1
"This game kicks ♥♥♥. The development cycle has been laid out professionally and is transparent; you know exactly what you're getting into when you spend the money. In my eyes, the other RTS titles available play like comic books, whereas AotS plays like a novel. The balance of factions is spot on, after many ranked matches it is clear that the strategic decisions decide your strength, not the strength of the units themselves. This game will scale well with time, as there is ridiculous headroom in the engine for expansion (which the devs have shown they are committed to. ) If you've had the itch since the old C&amp;C days, this will scratch it.   8/10",1
"I would love to give this a good rating, and definitly would... However.. Good luck playing it... Because right nw, the servers are absolute garbage... You can't connect easily at all... And if you do, good luck staying connected for long enough to get anything done... This also goes for Single player as well.. :/ So sad... Because it has great gameplay.",-1
"Mount and Blade is a fun sandbox game. Just riding around the world killing things. It's a bit like a medieval Grand Theft Auto. Except it's not at all like a medieval Grand Theft Auto.  The opening moments can be a bit slow when you're hunting bandits. But as you level up and grow your army you'll... run around trading smoked fish for a few pieces of coin.  But it's very fun. I assure you. Trading fish... Buying for 4 and selling for 24. I guess you could trade in more expensive stuff. If you can find cheap Salt for example.  But yeah this game is open world so even if you don't want to trade in cheap goods you can always join a faction and go to war. Or even create your own faction and go to war against everybody. Choices matter. And even though everyone is faceless in this game, you'll soon develop relationships with a few. But it's completely your choice, the game does not dictate who is important and who is not.  But I'm rambling. This game is a lot of fun.",1

"One of the most immersive games I've ever experienced. From start to finish, this game grabs your attention with it's extensive layers and depth of gameplay. At times it can feel exhausting not knowing what to do, but allows room for creativity by the player. A real photographer like myself was captivated by it's beautiful atmosphere, wrapped together with possibly the best gaming soundtrack of the modern era. This is a game that really speaks to my generation and our love for photography as an art form. Highly recommended with infinite replay value.",1

"Hacknet has been an insanely fun game, it's very rare that you can buy a game and get addicted to it within the first hour of playing it.

"Arma 3 is a very unique game, with a bunch of cool features. the producers have made it very realistic, but there could be a few other things added. With all the mods you can get, it can get much more realistic very quickly. The heli DLC will come out this Nov. 4th, which will add some new features like slingloading, firing from chopper seats, and many other things. The Fligh model can either be simple (What it is now) or advanced. I have tested it, and it is much more realistic, but not like DCS. The graphics are much better than Arma 2, But they can get glitchy. When somebody dies, it looks like they just lose all their bones and collapse, which can result in some pretty hysterical dead body's. The body armor is over-powerful at times. Once I shot somebody with a 12.7 mm sniper rifle, and I hit them right in the chest, but they had body armor, and did not kill him, and it didn't look like it hurt him too much either, because he was still running. There are mods that fix all of these, but mods are not allowed on most servers if you plan on playing online. There are of course the glitches, which Arma has tons of. Most of them do not really affect gameplay. For example, I was playing and I got on a quad to drive to a mission. When I got on, I was standing on top of the quad, and Drove around like that to my mission. If you can access my screenshots, I have some pictures of that, and the demorphed body's. It is tons of fun, especially multiplayer, even though you will always get one of the campers with a sniper and a rocket launcher, waiting to kill anybody that gets close to them. All in all, I would give it an 8/10, mainly because of the glitches.",1

"*There are not any Spoilers that I know of, but just in case here is a little Caution: Potential Spoilers*  [TL:DR] - The game experience was awesome. I loved the atmosphere and the ambiance. And who doesn’t love New York? The UI is not boring to look at, the combat, while repetitive, is not that bad. Good upgrade and skill options and an overall good game from Ubisoft and certainly worth a buy.   Alright so, as someone who has clocked up to over 20+ hours on this game, I feel I am qualified enough to write a review. Keeping in mind discussions have gone about saying “you should be required to play at least x-amount of hours before reviewing a game!” Well I think I’ve done my portion and experienced the game enough to be able to write this.   Graphics: As some may say; a downgrade. But that isn’t an issue. I’ve got no problem with the graphics, and the game looks great. I will not let graphics ruin my experience on this game as some people have said has happened. I don’t mind the look of the game, I think it looks well, and I enjoy it quite much. Then again, I know what I bought and knew what I was getting into. I did not ‘expect’ an over-the-top game.   Scenery: New York, New York. I absolutely love how they mapped out this game. Running up and down the streets, climbing over cars, and hearing the snow crunch under my feet. I found the map to be refreshing. It is interesting how they made the architecture broken down to its simplest form when looking onto your map. I found that this really helped when looking to players, group members, friends, and missions. Its mediocre look is justified by the vibrant glowing of quests and missions.   Ambiance: From sound to people talking in the background, I am immersed within’ a chilly atmosphere. Helping citizens in need, to hearing their witty comments about how I look tired and drained. I will say, something I didn’t quite like was the repetitiveness of the voice-overs. Going to vendors and hearing them say the same thing 4 out of 5 times. I get it! You are upset you lost a sale, you were really hoping I would drop some cash, but instead, you gave me the cash as I really used vendors in the first part of my experience to sell.   Gameplay: I love the User Interface of this game. The sleek look, and loading screen is intricately designed and overall pleasant to look at. My health bar, grenade and healthkit signs are not up in the top right or left corner, but following me, and near my vision. This eased my eyes and I liked how easy it was to keep track of my health while aiming, and not having to lose track of my eye-sight on the target. When fighting enemies, their health bars seemed a bit small, and hard to see at times, but I didn’t mind them. I just liked knowing where my targets were at, and thank you for that skill talent that allows me to map out enemies in the area with the press of a button! The gameplay experience is, in my opinion, fun. I didn’t find it boring at all.  Dark Zone: Oh gosh. I don’t want to crap on this game, I really don’t. But here is where most of my problems came from. I rather casually free roam and go look for mayhem than to go into Dark Zone. Honestly, despite the better gear. Maybe it is because this game is a new release, I don’t know but the camping and spawn-killing is insane. It’s to the point where it is honestly unplayable for those who do not have the upper hand and have not gone in with a group of high level and greatly geared friends. It’s like if you didn’t join the Dark Zone right away, you are automatically screwed because the first people to enter the Zone got the good gear faster and is now out for your blood. It’s truly hectic and I hope it lightens up. Until then I will surely be far away from the Dark Zone. It truly is a dark place.   Personal Experience: I can’t lie, I like the game. Maybe would go so far as to say I love the game. I have had a great time with it, and will continue to pre-order Ubisoft games and support them. Yes, I am a pre-orderer and proud! I support Ubisoft 100% and do not believe that they dish out crap games. I am sorry for those of you who have had a bad experience with Ubisoft. But there is a simple fix, stop buying the games. Anyway, I won’t tell you what to do. However, I came right from Far Cry: Primal to The Division, this week has been fantastic for me and gaming. Please, keep up the good work Ubisoft! I’ll be sticking around!     My Rating Scoreboard :  [] Trash [] Do not buy [] Maybe… but only maybe [] If you’re into this kind of thing [] Only purchase when on sale [x]   You won’t regret it!   [] Well done! Worth the money!",1
"This is one of the best games from the 90s and an all time classic. Great story (should get a movie), great atmosphere, great arcade gameplay. I remember playing this as a kid on the PS1 and I loved it, one of my favourite games. Despite everything I can't recommend  this version  of the game, it's not up-to-date and worthy for a game in 2016. It looks like the developer just wanted to make some money until they released 'New'n'Tasty! - Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee' in 2015 (same game like this but updated). They didn't put any effort in  this version  of the game: no graphic updates, low resolution, no fully controller support... They didn't do anything to make  this version  of the game playable for PC.  So if you like to play Abe's Oddysee, buy New'n'Tasty!! ",-1
I used to love this game it had awesome chracters and a original feel. BUT it now has many chracters with op combos and many other little things that i dislike not hate but dislike. What i hate is that alllllll servers that i go on every 10 secs i have to reconnect and no i dont mean log out come back in i mean your stuck there just frozen also it doesnt stop other players from ♥♥♥♥ING killing you if it wasnt for that i could look over it but no im just stuck there getting killed not able to stop it.,-1

"So i can't suggest this game because it really is an early access. I enjoyed playing it as you can tell by the hours I've put into it but that's just me. I'm the type of person that is satisfyed by sitting there with a mining laser and just going to town on rocks all day long. Totally not joking i love mining in video games. However i know that it's not every one's cup of tea so i can't recommend it to any one else unless i know they are like me. Wait for the price to come down to 15 dollars if it is going to remain in this state or wait for a huge update for the 60 dollar price, though some thing tells me the 15 dollar price will happen first.",-1
"This Game Is Soooo Much Fun every single game that i have played that were Strategic .. This is the only one that stood out to me .. Mostly just the series .. I totally Recommend this game 7.5/10 GOOD GAME , But not as best as the older series ..",1
"Great game for people who aren't MGS die-hard fans, don't care about stealth that much and just want loads of weapons, customization and gameplay. Story is pretty decent, playtime is around 100-300h and it can get repetitive with the missions &amp; side jobs.   You can attack other people's FOBs (Forward Operation Bases, not your Mother Base) or defend your own. You won't lose much except some resources (not the resources you get by playing singleplayer) and some staff members.   Also, the online version comes out for PC on january 2016 (for people owning this game). So yeah, wait for a sale if you care more about the multiplayer version.  Worth the money? Absolutely.",1
It's a good 2.5 platformer.The guards talking in Punjabi. 8.5/10...,1

"Half-Life... That name... No matter if you are a console gamer or just got into gaming and know nothing about the games out there, everyone has heard of or seen somewhere something about Half-Life. This is no wonder, released in 1998 and a true legend in the videogames history for being not only the turning point in Valve's fame and expansion towards creating Steam, developing the mighty Source engine and all other magnificent games they've made over the years, but also for being a thrilling FPS adventure which still fascinates gamers 17 years after the official release.  The game manages to completely merge you with the character you are guiding, Gordon Freeman, through the massive Black Mesa venue. You are directly introduced into the action, no overwhelming storytelling, cutscenes or anything like that. By doing this, you get the complete feeling of being where Gordon is, without being rejected from the action as a mere spectator. The story is not at all overloaded with thousdands of plot twists to try to keep the action on. You are given a objective at points and you have to get through loads and loads of unexpected events on the way to your 'checkpoint'. That makes the gameplay action packed and, most importantly, dynamic.  Probably the most impressive thing of the entire game is the incredibly imaginative and complex world in which the game goes on. It is huge (and I think that the word huge is too weak to describe its actual size) and, again, complex as hell. Your main struggle will in all likely be to find the way to the next stage as entrances are well hidden and nearly all of them require you to do something to open it. And yes, you'll need to use your imagination to figure out how to pass through an obstacle or open a locked door. The possible obstacles and their respective ways to overcome them are countless. The game also invites you to explore secret areas in which there may be utilities like weapons, ammo or a warmly welcomed health kit. All in all, the entire game will take around 20 hours to complete entirely.  If I described the enemies you'll find through the game, I'd be spoiling the gameplay. Every enemy has his meaning to the storyline, ones more related than others, but generally it's not a bunch of NPCs randomly spawned here and there that you have to kill. As you go past the chapters, the enemies will change. Weapons and armor utilities are also fully connected to the stage you're at and are all completely different. You have three kinds of weapons: fire weapons, experimental weapons (Black Mesa is a research venue) and   alien weapons   (bit of a spoiler there, so be careful!). The stages through the game will take you to differently ambiented places in which you'll get the respective kind of weapon.  Overall, there's not much more to say about this game. I could write the typical pros and cons summary at the end of the review, but it is hard to do. All I can say is that this is a must-have. It's a masterpiece of videogames. No other game, whatever the better graphics and all the new-gen stuff will be as good as this game is unless it pays the same attention to detail, imagination and creativity.  10+/10",1
"I think the game is fun, for the dragon expansion pack there literally needs to at least have four dragons instead of one, In the future I'm going to get the rest of the expansions, besides I bought this game for fourty-nine cents and it's about dinosaurs and extra cool stuff in the other expansions, which cost as much as the original game now.",1
"I don't understand why this game has so many bad reviews (probably because its a bunch of 5 year olds who prefer call of duty) But this is a nice little game. Yes it is very short and doesn't have much gameplay or story but its more of a little adventure to show you what its like to have anxiety. I myself have anxiety (Not social anxiety but i've felt a bit that sam here has) and i try to hide myself when im scared or sad, that is kind of what happens in this game.  7/10  go find another game call of duty players",1

It pays homage to almost everything awesome, doesn't take itself seriously, but in the end, still has enough hard to give a rat's patootie about.

"I love rocket league... its a sad day because up until 2 weeks ago i couldnt get enough. I know this post wont fix anything but i feel like i need to do something because my heart is broken.   Until recently this game has been my favorite game of all time, and i wanted to make a run at playing competitive. i have around 44 ping in every game, but the 'rubber banding' has made the game unplayable, i have great internet and 'specs' on my computer are solid af but im still experiencing some serious packet loss in this game alone. I dont know if it was a recent update or if the servers are on thier way out but it used to run perfectly and now i cant play the game at any competitve level.   I say this in hopes that if this is a problem others are experiencing and it is in fact not on my end. than the boys and girls in charge of this game will make an effort to fix this problem. I'll put this game over any other game ive played in all of my time on this earth but unfortunately its unplayablity has made it a dead game for me.   Otherwise thank you for the fun and i would reccomend anyone to get this game.",1
"I'll admit that I expected this to be total garbage. I'll also admit that I was wrong. I have been a long time Saints Row fan. From the original on consoles and than the past three on PC. This stand alone DLC looked to be a cheap throw away game that takes the franchise further over the shark, while removing all customization. This is true. However, flying is really fun. Crazy fun. Despite my beleif that the franchise needs to reel itself back in, Gat Out of Hell really shines with it's awesome gameplay and goofy story. It also ends with something of a hint of what will come to be with Saints Row 5. It's a surprisingly must have game especially for Saints Row fans. For real sticklers to the franchise, the game reads your Saints Row 4 save and presents 'The Boss' as you created them in SR 4, instead of just throwing in a default character. It's a nice touch. Also, after a short tutorial you are able to choose whether you play as Gat or Kenzie. Both have the exact same powers.  I do have to note that the games mission progression has several logic errors. Never did it break the game, or progression itself, but the story advances almost randomly, and it rarely makes since as to why. For instance, my mission was to save my friends, but I had yet to actually meet all these people. Once I did I was allowed to continue the mission, but it was totally out of the logical order they intended. This type of thing happens a lot in this game, but it is so absurd that it really doesn't matter.",1
"Definitely for anyone who enjoyed the Walking Dead and the GoT TV series.  Story slots nicely between the events in the TV show and keeps the same vibe too.  Now Telltale, can you make a Hannibal game?",1

"A fantastic game! probably my favourite in the bioshock series. The gameplay is fluid and the new vigors are fun to use. Storyline is top notch, and somewhat confusing at times (in a good way). it's absorbing as well. I find myself starting to play at 6:30, then I look at the clock at it's 9:30. It's a game that you can pour hours into.",1
I got this on sale for 6 bucks. and this is the best deal i have ever gotten on steam... easily,1
"I really thought I was going to love this game, and I did, during the first couple of tutorial missions. I thought to myself 'wow, this is amazing! I can't wait to colonize Mars! I'm going to spend hours and hours spreading across the planet!'  Sadly, after the first couple of tutorials they start introducing mechanics that make the game less fun. Once you really get into the game, you're no longer focused on colonizing, because you get an extremely limited amount of buildings. Once they're built, you need to watch a little stock ticker and sell off your spare resources. You can't do it all at once though, because selling dips the price, so you need to pause the game every 30 seconds or so to do it. It gets really tedious.  There's a goofy stock mechanic where you dump all of your extra money into your own stock (which doesn't seem to do much because people can and will still buy you out) and other people's stock, where you buy them out. If you get bought out (which can happen with no warning if you're not paying attention) it's instant game over.  This is a well made game and I'm sure lots of people will find it's what they're interested in playing, but a 30 minute game of micromanaging silicon prices isn't what I want to play. Maybe that's my fault for not looking into what this was more thoroughly, but I can't think of anyone I would recommend this to.  Weak thumbs down. Sorry game.",-1
First Tomb Raider game I played. Satified overall. Glad I got the GOTY version...,1
Good game and nice community,1
"I wanted to like this game, because I'm a fan of Portal and puzzle-solving games, and the premise seemed interesting. Sadly, I found this game quite boring to play. The biggest issue for me was the severe limitation of movement. It is basically a pixel-hunting point-and-click adventure, reminiscent of the 'Escape'-style games. Each chapter is basically a room you have to escape from. The voice acting is terrible, and the journal entries you find along the way did little to make me care about the characters or the facility. Compare that to Portal 2, where the humor and the post-apocalyptic story kept you going at a fast pace. This game is glacial. If you miss a tiny little clue, you are basically stuck, and can't continue or do anything else until you find it. This game might be worth $5, but I paid $13 and I felt robbed. Poor story, boring puzzles, weak characters, and almost no freedom of movement.",-1

"OK, so I'm writing this from the perspective of somebody who beat the original DS2 a number of times before purchasing what I thought should have been a free upgrade. In short: Worth it.  Now, regarding the graphics I can tell that there has been an improvement, but it hasn't been jaw-dropping imo. But I'm not here for the graphics. No, the new enemy placements really make this 'upgrade' worth it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it feels like a new game, but it definitely feels like a new challenge. Now, all that to say I wouldn't get this upgrade unless you are already tired of the original. This is probably better for those who want new life breathed into one of their favorite games. I played the orignial enough to unlock The Dark Soul. This upgrade has me wanting to do so again.",1

"Looking at positive and negative reviews alike, I'll try (and fail) to keep this brief as I can:  -This game just reminds me of retro titles like Metal Storm or Gradius, Metal Storm because it's kind of a 'what you see' style of combat, Gradius because there's different ways to approach execute a situation. I can get behind a game like this that's so quick and flexible more than I can a game like Dark Souls (get ready for comparisons, others did it so here's my 2 cents between 'em).   -Treasure finding encourages exploration, which is equivalent to grinding in this game, which is ♥♥♥♥ing genius and actually makes me want to look around more to get stronger. Dark Souls enjoys being brutal, not punishing you for exploring but still saying' ♥♥♥♥ you, you knew the risks' when you die and lose what temporary progress toward the next few levels you've made before the next bonfire.  -Story is basic but also begs to be expanded upon, so much is laid before you in the overworld and the intro cutscene that I'm wondering just how many stories are intersecting here between the dead Colossi/Titans/Giants, the fellow drifter, our main hero's visions (matched with the intro cutscene which makes me want to believe he's something of a late arrival), the Jackal, and every other little cove in the game that just screams atmosphere. I would make a Dark Souls comparison here, but Dark Souls conveys its story very straightforward, so I don't need to compare too much for differences to be seen. In short: I like the story, but the tone of the world and flavour makes me want to gag and hide in the corner so my Grandma won't see me crying (white bone again? where's the estus? I'm thirsty.) Not as enticing.  -Biggest difference between the two: Hyper Light Drifter makes me go 'woah...w-what  the...♥♥♥♥...?' . A killer atmosphere that begs for similar titles that know what they want to do, and makes me beg for more atmospheric games that can tell you a story while also saying nothing at all. More for interpretation, for thinking, less 'The Elephant is now purple', outright statement. Dark Souls: 'The Elephant is now Purple, abandon hope and shoes all who enter.'  **Tl;dr** this game is an entirely different beast in execution than Dark Souls is, even if similarities are present. Play it and give it a chance, no promise you'll love it if you're a die-hard Souls fan, more of a suggestion if you're a classic Zelda, hell even a Shovel Knight fan.",1
"I've been a hobby programmer for over 30 years already. During that time I've made file management tools (for DOS), message handlers (for the FidoNetwork), administrative programs (for my agency I ran for 3 years) and even 2D games. Sadly I never managed to dive into the 3D world other than playing them as games.  Only 'recently' (LOL - late 2013) I hopped to the Unity3D engine and...made a 2D game for Android to get used to OOP and C#. After that I started a couple of other 2D projects, but I constantly found that only X and Y were lacking for me - I needed the Z-axis and not by using layers in 2D!  There I was, in need of 3D and no clue on how to get started. Sure, I've been playing with Blender for a while already, but I couldn't get further than modifying the prime objects and drop them in 1 scene. I kinda felt like a 2 year-old stacking LEGOs on top of each other, while knowing I could do more...  So I decided to buy Blender for Dummies (no, SERIOUSLY!) and am currently reading it and experiementing with the things I learn along the way. And while I haven't been able to create anything decent yet, I am overwhelmed with all that Blender is capable of. And that's just the beginning of the book I'm reading! Browsing through it I see all kind of things explained that I want to learn and use, like character modeling and animations. And to make things better, Unity3D is able to import Blender files natively!  So yeah, I haven't yet realy used Blender like most of the people reviewing it. I don't have any edication in 3D modelling, but I know already that Blender is a hell of a powerfull tool that allows you to make virtually anything you want. And the price..? FREE, it's open source software!",1

"I spent many hours playing original Giana Sisters. It was great game! I remember when they announced, if I'm not mistaken, a sequel for Nintendo DS. Oh boy. It was one of my favorite NDS games ever. Completed few times and even done a speedrun. Truly amazing game. When I saw another Giana Sisters game I was really happy. It feels really like Giana Sisters need more love. So, how is this game? It's a hard question. I enjoyed it for a while but not as much as this 2D remake or another game that was made on NDS. It missing something since Giana Sisters went into 3D. Sure, the world is beatiful, characters cute as always, and I love this soundtrack that gives you nostalgia vibe but...  ... you know, well made 2D graphics looks much better. That's why I loved Giana Sisters DS. Level designs in Twisted Dreams are also kinda boring - it doens't make you want to explore every corner of level. Even tho I love hard platformer games Giana Sisters had few really annoying moments. Maybe it's just me, but few levels were way too long - it would be nice to have twice as many level even if they were cutted in half. Dream Rush mode is kinda confusing at first but overall it's also enjoyable. The most popular game is also, in my opinion, the most boring one. It's not bad game but doesn't bring so many happiness as it was with previous two. Playing it more tha one time can be really boring.",1

This is the worst game ever made......  This game is laggy and love to send you lag spikes when you least expect it. This game has one goal and that goal is to blue-screen your computer.  I have about 70GB of addons for this game and thats just enough to make it good.  I hate this game with every fiber of my being. I love this game so much.  I've made life long friends on this game. I've had so much fun with this game.  This game is the best game in the world This game is the worst game in the world This game will make you scream and yell and you will suffer.

"This game is unlike any other racing game. Now I know you here that phrase used all the time and trust me I get tired of hearing it too but trust me, this is unlike any racing game out there. The immersion is so incredible and the graphics are so good that (no joke) it actually looks like real life. I looked up Project CARS on google just to see some amazing screenshots and one of them was actually real life but for the first 10 to 15 secs I thought it was the game...  -UI: The UI is very clean and crisp. Everything is easy to find and manage. Only gripe is that changing your liveries for cars requires you to go to your garage and change it from there instead of the quick car list. (Not a big deal but still worth mentioning). 10/10  -Singleplayer: I haven't even started a career yet but I assume it's amazing. As for just random racing, it's amazing. You can add up to 55 cars (most I've seen at least) on the track at once which was at Le Mans and can also have multi class so you can simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans or 24 Hours of Nurburgring. 9/10  -AI: AI is a bit iffy. They are quite a challenge if you have it at 100 and do make mistakes on there own but seem to not even care your on the road. 7/10  -Multiplayer: This is where I have spent the most time on, mainly cause it is actual people and I like that more. Everything runs smooth and the people for the most part are nice and aren't trolls/wreck everything. Getting together with your buddies is a breeze. This is by far my favorite part of the game. 10/10  Bugs/Crashes: The only crash I have experienced was on Spa Francorchamps and my screen froze but the audio continued. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to close it which kinda sucked but over all that is nothing compared to all the fun I have had.   Basic Specs of my Setup: NVIDIA GTX 970 (EVGA)   i5 4590    8gb RAM",1

"Simply awesome shooter game. If you liked Resistance series, Halo, and a bit of Russian slang, this is your game.   ",1
"Yes, I recommend this game. I've gotten so much out of the game and more because of the small references to the previous games.  Story-wise, it's short (a little shorter than PW's main story) but just as engaging and I definitely wish they had finished Mission 51.  FOBs are a fun way to gain resources, rewards and staff but I'd put off building the FOB until you get a good amount of developments done and high-ranking staff so you can deter any would-be invaders from taking your hard-earned staff and resources.  The DLC is alright but it really isn't worth it in the long run. The Sneaking Suits are great for starting out if you haven't uploaded your Ground Zeroes save for the staff and Sneaking Suit or for reliving MGS3.  And yes, EVA's suit DOES give a tactical advantage when unzipped (longer reflex time) but loses the camouflage when it's zipped.",1

"Age of Fear 2 is a refreshingly fun strategy title that marries a tabletop wargame with elements of role-playing. Despite its depth, Age of Fear has a perfectly intuitive interface that makes learning the ropes a simple endeavor. The turn structure and combat mechanics make sense immediately, and the joy of leveling your troops and upgrading their skills remains engaging throughout the campaigns. Though a little too pricey, the fact is that this is a very solid title for anyone that likes strategy games set in a fantasy universe.",1

TLDR; 6/10  Gameplay: Is buggy at certain points and has some glitches. Some parts of the game are just frustrating due to certain angles where you have to fight the monsters in or even play with such as the dollhead mini game. Some of the jumping puzzles are really annoying to do even though you know exactly what needs to be done. Locking on to that menacing ruin is extremely annoying and not needed in my opinion. Locking on in general makes the angles hard to play with most of the time making it useless as it is much easier to play without the lock on feature.   Graphics: Most of the game is pretty to look at or gory enough to fit the atmosphere.  Other annoyances: Invisible walls. You can see a space to walk on or to jump to but you cannot go there. This doesn't reduce my rating but is just something I find annoying in games.  Press X... =_= This is a console port to PC game. Why can't you just change that? (X is actually spacebar)  Story: The story starts off slowly and doesn't tell you much at first but you get more of the plot near the ending. The ending is also open to theories and discussion which is great. It makes you think of the ending and what it means.  Difficulty: easy casual. Played the game on the 3/4 'Hard'difficulty setting and it was not challenging at all.   Before you play: Look up alice madness steam dlc to unlock the extra dlc comstumes and weapons.  I decided to give the game a 6/10 because it was fun but some areas of the game was a little draggy and I had to keep pushing myself to finish the whole game.,1
"Ok so this is why I love Splash Damage as a company! They take a formula and improve it to the point of excellency.  I played all of the games they made and I`m not such a fan of multiplayer shooters but from Wolfenestein Enemy Territory going through Quake Wars and this I LOVED them and played so many hours I went nuts. Not that much Brink thou` I was and still is on the TF2 boat.  So Dirty Bomb takes the classic Splash Damage multiplayer oriented FPS formula: 2 teams with various objectives, one on defence the other on offence. As always we have classes but this time things....changed a bit. IN A GOOD WAY!!! You have your classes but instead of upgrading them through the match (Enemy Territory style) you get crates with various loadouts of gunsand perks that you can choose before a game. This helps ballance alot since you do not upgrade your class through ganing XP while the others are eating dirt. Your means of getting XP are not kills as much as most people would love but doing objectives, and this is where Splash Damage shines. Multiplayer objective oriented games are lacking and those that tried to make them....fail horribly, but the granddaddy of them all Splash Damage once again improves it`s own formula: you may open new acces points on the map, you are ALWAYS required to work with a teammate (previous games could be done solo if capable) and this encourages cooperation. Also the way classes mix is great: each class relies on another to fill the gap (Splash Damage tradition) and when more capable players end up mixing classes in a team you know you are up for something special. Once again movement is important. From Wolfenestein Enemy Territory`s bunny hopping (double jumps for the uninitated) through Brink`s parkour style movement here we have a more toned down system relying more on wall jumps and trick jumps. (they sayd that Brink style parkour movement will be available to some classes in the future). Overall great game, not just beacuse I`m a fan of the company but compared to others on the market this has the quality and polish that only the makers of this genre could obtain. A must play for all FPS fans.",1

"i don't normally write reviews, but for 'Fingerbones' I will make an exception.  Fingerbones, though short in duration, has a fascinating story told through short manuscripts found the out the 3 (maybe 4?) rooms in the game. It challenges the player and makes them excersise their keeness of mind, making the player spot subtle cues in the notes placed in the enviroment. These clues help the player procceed forward in the game, making this an experience one will want to keep going through without pause. I know that whenever I solved a password to unlock a door I experienced a jolt of excitement. Fingerbones is an extremley well written narrative-driven game that I highly reccommend to others.",1

This Hitman game is great. I can even see how this could be the best Hitman game. Its good to see the developers take on a Blood Money style Hitman again.. but sadly this game has some serious issues.. This game runs weak for me with these last 2 episodes and them calling that half ♥♥♥♥♥ design of a tutorial a episode.... but you know what really kills me? The always online crap for a clearly single player game! Really? What happens if the servers go down? Ooops guess what all your unlocks and progress are gone FOREVER! Reguardless of my first issue this second issue is a game breaker and NEEDS to be fixed ASAP..

A sustainable agriculture is built on an ethical foundation of friendship and stewardship – a more enlightened concept of self-interest.   Thus, the new American farmers, who are finding ways to farm more sustainably, are creating a metaphor of a more sustainable human society. As a society, we must stop exploiting our natural environment. We must look again to the timeless principle of diversity in finding new means of sustaining human progress.  I believe that we can, and must, help create a new kind of agriculture that will sustain a high “quality of life” for farmers and society, both for this generation and for all generations to come. That’s why farming is important to America.",1

"This game makes almost no sense.   You can hire an army of giant bears and use it to free a zombie woman that you then marry, then go wage war inside your own pants in order to make them stronger.   It's also quite enjoyable as a game, albeit very hard and unfair at times. Worth a look, anyway.",1
"This game is well made, fun, and generally good all round. The art style may not be to suit all people, but noone can deny its very detailed, with sprites that can please those such as Zeus, or Pythagoras. That's how influential they are.  Gameplay is polished, respectable and very userfriendly. By this I mean, there are characters. Some require unlocking through acheivements and things, or finding in them in the game. It basicaly adds a purpose to actually do specific things. If you're a begginner, its easy to get into and play, and if you want to get better, its very simple to become a master.  This rougelite has become one of the best I've ever played, to be frank, and if they actually continue to produce updates on a (semi) regular basis, then I can guarentee, no single experience will be the same. Or at least unlikely to be simillar.  8/10 would review again.",1

"The game is awsome, but they never add new maps to the game, would be nice if they would think about a great game then let it fade away because you loose intrest in the game later on, you need to keep the game alive.....",1
"I really liked it and its great for xombie mods, cheap, good and fun to play with friends",1
"Very fun and funny game, should be more famous.",1
Tedious gameplay with little freedom to develop your own style made all the more painful by it trying too hard to be funny. Irritating voice acting with a child's sense of comedic timing and all the wit of a sack of dishwater.,-1
"So, I swear I'm not in it for the Hunnies, although that's the entire goal of the game. I pretty much bought this game out of curiosity and novelty, and I, surprisingly, got a fun and quirky puzzle game with an added twist. The match-three system is like a mix of bejeweled, pokemon shuffle, and puzzle &amp; dragons. It actually takes quite a bit of thought and strategy, having to consider what items would be right for each girl's date, setting up combos, and making sure you don't run out of moves. The girl's dialogue is actually pretty amusing a lot of the time. And at least Aiko points out how stereotypical the unique gifts are after I gave her some chopsticks or whatever (We also have the same birthday, I enjoyed that.) I also liked that I could play as a girl.  Also they get naked. Good game, would love a dude version, but I won't get my hopes up.",1

"Alright... This was probably the most boring RPG I've ever played. There's unfortunately no 'Adventure' in this game.  It's a simple, go here fetch this, go there deliver that games with a plot that's more boring than watching 'Man of Steel'.  There's about 5 fights in the entire game as well as no levelling up 2 different weapons and 3 set characters. This game is really chaotic and I don't recommend approaching it without a guide so here's mine.  &gt;Open the game &gt;Open google &gt;Search for 'Legend of Mysteria RPG save file'  &gt;Download a save file right before the ending of the game &gt;Load the file &gt;Be just as confused as to what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on as you would, if you'd devoted 8 hours to the game. &gt;Uninstall the game and delete local content, so that you will never come by any game files and have a vietnam flashback, due to the terror this game caused you  So my overall rating is:    10/10 it's a masterpiece  ",-1
"Bethesda made Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 so there's no point in my opinion comparing it to NV or Fallout 2.  Fallout 3 had superior RPG elements to Fallout 4. The characters, the storyline, the way things were handled in Fallout 3, was far better than Fallout 4.  In Fallout 3, I was immersed from start to finished. I even played the whole game in thirdperson and it made me feel like I was there. You talk to the people, and see how they live, it was obvious it was a post-apocalyptic world. You come across tough men, thieves, and people just going insane, trying to escape the dark world they now live in. Your actions seemed much more serious. The game didn't see it as a joke for blowing up Megaton.  In Fallout 4, it's a joke. No, I don't want my enemies to explode in caps, thank you. Oh okay, I just got out of the vault and suddenly I'm wielding a minigun while wearing power armor trying to kill a deathclaw. What the hell? Am I supposed to be intrigued by the action filled galore?   Like many others have said. Fallout 4 is an action game with next to no RPG elements. I don't even remember what sort of RPG elements are there, oh, maybe you can level up, right? That's 'ROLE PLAYING', huh?  I enjoy it for what it is. Just another video game where you shoot for fun, like CoD, but with more variation in weapons. You will NOT be immersed, you will only enjoy the shooting, and you will always be reminded that you're just playing a silly video game. ",-1
"It's alright for a kawaii-desu anime game. It's really frustrating when you get stuck in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spot though. Kind of addicting. There is so much pink and bright colors... Otherwise, it's an alright game for downtime if ya don't know what to play. :)",1
"The only way to make it run in a modern resolution seems to be to install a mod that makes the ships unsinkable. If you're an ACTUAL sub commander with an ancient computer, you'll probably like this game. Otherwise it is just more effort that it was worth for me to get it to work given the learning curve of playing the game.",-1
This game made me view the holocaust differently. ,1
Great game but the DLC gets less and less impressive and doesn't add much to the game for the cost. Base game gets 1/1 score points. Bravo!,1
I had high hopes for this game. So far it's controls are absolute S###. I would not recommend.,-1
"'A Bird Story'  When compared with To The Moon, it's not much to look at, it's a short, yet sweet and touching story. There is no dialogue, yet the story is understandable, just using the senses and emotions and that is something I enjoyed from this game. This was definetely a worthwhile buy, however the game itself is so short I don't feel it is worth the asking price. However if it is ever -40% or greater I would highly suggest you buy this game, and won't be disappointed with what you get out of it.  Overall I really loved the game and for just being a small preview I look forward to the following completion and am curious to see how it evolves.  Lastly the soundtrack from this small game is lovely and I really enjoyed it, take a moment to listen while you enjoy the adventure.",1

"Noobs from  mergegames.com  released a patch that broke every commandos game on steam, made them impossible to run on anything but Win 10, removed previosly working MP and made store page a false advertising, broke mods, in-game cheats and other features.

This is by far the best suspense game I have played in a while. The atmosphere is like no other horror game I have come across so far. This is a must play if you love horro/suspense games!,1
A thought provoking psychological experience on par with games like Shrek: The Game and The Amazing Spider-Man 2.  It has sick running and jumping and cool-♥♥♥ weapons. There is a mildly Asian woman named Jade because she is Asian.     You can strangle children to death.   ,1
A somewhat cheap copy of Arkham City that nonetheless manages to entertain all the way through. 7/10,1
"Enemy AI is extremely beautiful in this game. Charge a plama bomb, fire it...have the enemy dodge left a bit and it misses complete. They're smart, extremely so. And they should because robots.  The sci-fi steampunk setting is very nice and brings back memories of Blade Runner or The Fifth Element. Audio is very crisp and clean meeting the right notes for weapon, explosion, robot, and more. The comicbook style of the story between levels is very well written as well as visually appealing.  This game has more going for it than many of the AAA shooters that have been shoveled out for many years now. Pick it up at full price (heck, it's only $15) or wait until another sale, but it's for sure of any Sci-Fi lover or FPS lover.",1
"You know a game has its hooks in you when you start humming the battle music at work.  Everythings been improved on from the last game except for optimisation, which is terrible but its a turn based game so what are you realy complaining about.   Setting up ambushes, sneaking into facilites and demolishing them with a single ranger, eqquiping everyone in youre team with rocket launchers and running consecutive shot kills on entire enemy sqauds with one sniper. this game made me late for work and tired as ♥♥♥♥ for over a week and I loved it.  If you dont like moderate difficulty turn timers though, be cautious. They didnt bother me though, I understood exactly why they were put there and imo they were tuned perfectly. They keep the pace of the level up and force you to think and act aggresively rather than doing the standard move-overwatch-next turn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of the last game.  Sometimes youre forced to make rash decisions to make an objective and then puzzle youre way out of the ensuing chaos. They took the last xcom and sped it the ♥♥♥♥ up. something it sorely needed and I couldnt be happier for it.  If you like the last game but want something a little faster, with a stronger puzzle element, more chaos and less down time between significant missions. This is the xcom for you. If you like youre games significanlty slower with one thousand trees in every mission, play the last xcom.",1
"NNOOOO, this f2play is now a pay to win what a shame.",-1
"  This game has some nice mechanics like kicking and blocking, but theyu really dont matter when 5 people are fighting in the same place",-1
"I really want to recommend this game. I still play it, hoping it'll get better. Fact is, the game is broken which is a shame because there is a great deck building game here that only needs some tinkering to be a solid 'recommend' Here are the issues:  Too many OP enemy cards - These games should be hard but a card that kills any troop it damages? That's just ONE example  Bugged troop cards - Troops get 'stuck' in your deck. You are unable to deploy or trade in for better units.  Some really useless human abilities - As OP as enemies can be, some human cards and abilities are seemingly useless.  Click DONE. Click DONE again. Click DONE once more - If you play it, you'll know. Annoying.  This game should be hard, and you should lose more games than you win but even on easy, using the obvious 'good' stations, you'll be lucky to make it to round 7. I'll still keep playing this game because despite it's flaws it IS fun. But you'll end your games feeling 'cheated' by lousy game balancing and buggy cards.  Hope it gets patched and I can edit this review.",-1
"I forgot to breath so many times on this game ... 10/10 would forget again. This game gives you all the things that a parkour individual does, throw you in a very amazing, colorful, alive city, put some folks to start shooting at you, play an amazing soundtrack in the background and you run, and try to find your way as fast as you can. I am not used to run away so it really gives that thrill of fast thinking and trying not to get hit. New experience, great game.",1

"This game is as good as you expect for a 0,02 € game.  Its worth to buy just for the 'funny' bugs. A few of them :  1.A game where you cant adjust the volume is very weird. 2.In the main menu sometimes a car explodes. (not only in the main menu -.-) 3.When you connect to a server it works ^^ (when you try it a second one, the game crashes and a pop up gets up : 'OPPPS') Thats amazing -.- 4.When you shoot at the bottom (or almost any object) your whole clip unloads !!! 5.The sniper rifle has no icon in the inventory (that is named quality) 6.Some parts of the ground are not solid 7.There is no map 8.You spawn random on the map 9.The Deathmatch gamemode dont works So 10/10 would get a tinitus from the exploding car again !!!

"Fantasitc shooter. Combines a feeling of an open-world with a linear story and path. It is a very difficult and I'd reccomend even veteran FPS players to not overestimate their skills as on normal you will die plenty by the end. Graphics are obviosuly outdated, but the art style and story are not hyper-realistic so it doesn't hurt it significantly in 2015. Try it if you like a good FPS.",1
I like this game but if they dont fix the server lag no one will play it!!!!!!,1
"Pretty neat. I wouldn't say 'You have to try this,' nor would I say 'It's not worth your time.' So if it comes down to a 'yes' or 'no,' since it's free, I'm recommending it provided you have the beef to run it.",1
"Very nice graphics and gameplay, definitely a fan.",1

"Interesting and engaging story, Gripping roguelike action, where you always feel like you're invincible, but there's a voice in the back of your head reminding you that you thought that every other time and at any moment you're about to die if you're not prepared for everything. The story sequences don't vary that much between playthroughs, but the random encounters are just as big a part of the world and insist on keeping it interesting and keeping you on your toes.  The game is one of the major roguelikes, with a pedigree going all the way back to the beginning of the genre. It's also the flagship of the T-Engine4 and part of an ongoing modding scene.  ToME is available online for free, but I've reviewed it irrespective of its price. I feel lucky to have stumbled upon this gem on my first irl run!",1
"A little bit of a learning curve, and not really recommended for playing alone as you will get killed in pub servers. However, we have a server rented (but too expensive), and have a lot of fun playing this game!",1
"This is an awsome game!  However, I do have a few recomendations: 1) Singleplayer- Now, I love a good mmo as much as the next guy but I do belive that this game needs a singleplayer. because not everyone loves to fight fight fight. Some people just like to fly around and have fun as a amazingly animated dragon 2) Peaceful mode- I think this game needs a peaceful multiplayer for many of the same reasons that it needs a singleplayer, with the addition of people wanting to talk with eachother and soar around on this game's rather pretty maps. 3) Slowing Control- Sometimes you get going very fast and you need a control to slow down mid dive or something. An idea for the annimation could be the dragon flaring out it's wings and lashing out it's tail.  But despite this game lacking a bit of content, it is a very fun game and I look foward to seeing it grow.",1
a distillation and simplification of the god game. thoroughly interesting. i only wish i was more patient that i could stand to play more often as the simplified concept can tire after extended play.,1

"I got this game on PC in a THQ farewell bundle. Something about that THQ filed for bankruptcy for some reason. I played it on Steam with a controller and it was kinda okay. The story is about North Korea’s leader Kim Joung-il giving control to his son. He then unites the Korea’s, they take on the world, and actually succeed in doing so. Didn’t really understand the entire story. I remember Angry Joe saying in his review of this that North Korea couldn’t invade the U.S. if they wanted. Something about they couldn’t supply their armies for an extended occupation. Basically North Korea invading America is farfetched in reality. While playing the game it was a little shocking all the war stuff. At some point you take control of a Goliath tank and it looks amazing. The freedom fights are pretty bland and you don’t really get attached to them. Even all the stuff that happens like the white phosphorus and stuff seems all for nothing. The single player game is only 3 to 4 hours and I expected more for the game and the original Red Dawn writer. Yeah he helped make this even though it’s pretty short. Multiplayer I heard is real good but I haven’t played that part yet. Not because of trolling I just thought no one plays it but I’ll see if anyone on Steam does. Also heard they’ll make a sequel and I hope it’s better.",-1
Fantastic Game based on Squad gameplay! Get a group of 4 and get going!,1
50mb update literally every damn day.....seriously icefrog? its not even usefull crap u are updating and the fact that it takes 50mb+ to patch a simple fix for a smalll bug on the map is utterly ridiculious let alone everyday i log on to steam i have one of these goshdang updates waiting for me like clockwork..,-1

"I was under the impression that this was a football simulator. Let me tell you, it is NOT!  This is an abomination of the beautiful sport of football, enjoyed by millions around the world and played by pro's such as Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo (they are amazing)  BUT when I spent my $20.00 United States Dollars on this so called 'football simulator', I was rudely informed during the tutorial that I could not get out of the stupid rocket powered buggy, and to shoot a goal, I needed to drive in to an oversized football. How do you call this a game?  Cars are meant for driving to and from the stadium to watch soccer games, NOT to play soccer.  I have sent a request for a refund and will get all my cousins on the developers if they do not accept the refund.  GOOD DAY.  /s",-1
Wonderful game with superb atmosphere. Especially good for when you're drunk and depressed...,1
"For me, this game's dialogue tree was the real hook. While each of the characters fits into a familiar archetype (goofy stoner, ♥♥♥♥♥y cool girl, troubled step-brother), they feel like actual people with fully-realized identities. That the game makes you care about their fictional lives and whether or not they survive the night is a big reason to play if you enjoy story- and dialogue-driven games.  Another thing people have praised is the art, and I have to tell you that I dragged my roommate (a graphic designer) over to check it out with me. She was ecstatic, which told a layperson like me, 'Yes dummy; it's pretty.'  I have 1 criticism, and it is by no means game-breaking.  The lack of a sprint option means your character and her follower(s) trudge through the world at a base that does not --quite-- sell the, 'Holy crap we need to solve this so we can go home alive in the morning!' vibe. Thankfully, the game's small map and relatively short length will ease any concerns you have about the slow walking pace. I don't think the developers overlooked putting one in there: most of the time that you're walking there's dialogue occurring, so you WANT to hang back and not jump to the next part of the map for fear of missing something interesting. It's when you draw close to the end-game and you're trying to finish some of the collectibles for an achievement and there's no more dialogue unless you move the plot forward that it really stands out (which was in large part my own fault for not getting them while I was in the area). I would have LIKED the option to jog, but I also think it would have been detrimental for this game, as it relies heavily on its excellent dialogue and story to keep the player interested.  -----------------Potential Spoiler Below-----------------  Having finished the game once, I don't quite know how to interpret the ending. While I managed to save everyone, it all felt a little TOO perfect. I was suspicious about how neat a bow was being tied over our experience, and my suspicions seemed (somewhat) confirmed by my best friend Ren repeating something he'd said on the ferry ride to the island the day before. Maybe I'm reading into it too much... or maybe we didn't get away quite as unscathed as we thought. &lt;___&lt;",1

"Now, when I first downloaded this, as it was during the free weekend, I believed it would be an excellent strategy game. I was wrong. Now, the concept seems great, but just too poorly excecuted for me to like it. 1. AI- Well, 1 shot can kill a man, but unfortunately, sometimes when I give orders to my characters, and press to see them, they don't do it. All i can say is thank god for the planning phase, or else the mission would be over before i could say 'WHAT THE ****?!' Your friendly AI, the people you control, take like 3 seconds to fire, keep in mind most turns only last like 5 seconds, this gives you around 2 seconds to move a guy. 2. Graphics- So-so, is all i can say, only about 2 death animations when a dude is shot, and most of the detail obviosly went into the pictures of characters, and that isn't saying much. 3. Story- Don't even bother, try to understand, your brain will disolve, but not before giving you the finger as it turns to mush. 4 -Gameplay- Oh boy, is this difficult. NO DIFFICULTY SETTING, except for the type of AI in instant skirmish (suicidal, old etc) 1 shot=1 kill regardless. You can get hit from the other side of the room with a single shotgun pellet and still die. Yeah programmers, Health bars would be nice seeing as your dumb squad fail to shoot unless they get a bullet in the face. Also, what the game does not tell you is that once you press 'PRIME', enemies will move, which completely buggers any plan you made. All you can do is hope they do not turn around when your guy is ready to shoot them. Trust me, most of the time they walk off, see one of my guys about to kill another Enyo:Nomad or whatever the **** they're called, and boom, you're dead. No buts, just dead *heavy 'yells DED, not big suprise'*. Why could we not see where enemies go in the form of waypoints, fewer of these waypoints or where they face the harder the difficulty, where a DIFFICULTY SETTING WOULD BE NICE. 5. Soundtrack- Best part about the game, not Portal 2 level, but still good. 6. Humor- Only in achivement names bub, otherwise, you need to only play the tutorial for a sarcastic remark. Overall, unless it's on sale for around £3 (about 5 dollars if you're American) I'd stay away. For £18.99, I could just go save up about £2 more and buy BOTH Portal games or Half Life/ hl2, so if they think they can charge more for this game alone. I don't think this is right. However, if you are still here and not up in arms either at the game or at me, THIS IS MY OPINION. Personally, I don't like this game, but if you do, that's fine. I just want to warn people about the problems I have with this game. On that note, goodbye, I am off the play some (in my opinion) better games.",-1
This game was a pleasant surprise! It has similar art to Krater (which I do like a lot) and offers a cool twist to the MOBA mechanics that makes the gameplay feel fresh.  So far I haven't had any troubles finding people to play with but It would be great to have more players joining.,1

"This game. Where to start. Goat simulator had taken over my life. I have spent countless hours on it and yet finding new things to do. new tasks to do and by far the most addictive game i've ever played!  Pro's: - Very fun. - easily spend 15 mins waiting for another game. - can spend hours on end enjoying the fun. - really cheap.  Con's: - once addicted... it takes over your life.  For anyone still unsure about buying the game, here is my best anecdote.  Strolling home late at night; i sit and wind down to goat simulator. 5 hours later im there running round as a penguin that is super buff one shotting cars all over the place. I then thought. I WILL OWN A GOAT..... Now I currently own 4 Pigmy goats and love them soo much!  All in all... This game has made my life soo much more happier!!!!",1

"The hit that started it all. This classic was revolutionary for it's time, yet it still stands in the list as one of my favorite games of all time. When Gabe Newall gave Chuck Norris a crowbar, he unknowingly created the most beloved and badass game character of all time: Gordon Freeman. I mean, he takes out an entire military coverup and obliterates an alien horde!",1
"Do you like hats? What about killing innocent civilians for money? Now how about different unlockable races, think those are cool? Bosses? RPG's? Overpowered swords made of jelly? Well all of those are included in this game. It's like the hit 'Terraria' and not as well known 'Risk of Rain' had a miracle child. Only issue is the amount of deaths that happen, 9/10",1
I clicked 3 times and completed a quest....   10/10 Would quest again,1
"While it may control a bit clunkely, and have a few graphical issues, this can easily be overlooked, as it is the only game that has made me cry real tears. I did so twice. One of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. I encourage everyone to play this game if not for its very enjoyable and satisfying gameplay, but for the emotional experince that this masterpeice can bring to you.",1
Did not care to continue after 30 minutes of playing. Watch a short gameplay video before buying if you're thinking about it.,-1
" Review  After my friends have bugged me to get this game, I finally did. It is an action-packed multiplayer shooter where you have to complete various heists of different difficulty. It is fun with friends, but that's about it. Joining games with random people is a nightmare because they often ragequit, and the singleplayer is just a fail. On singleplayer, the AI don't do anything to help you, so it's basically just you doing all of the work. Most of the missions are fun, but others are just plain stupid. The mission selection screen seems like the developers thought it would be a good idea to make players wait for missions to randomly popup, but it is not. After you complete each mission, most of the money goes to an 'off-shore account' where you basically can't ever use it except for buying certain things. In my opinion, they should have just not told you most of the money is going to an off-shore account, because it makes players rage when they see how much they actually get. As for buying upgrades, everything in the shop is ridiculously expensive. The game is pretty fun for trying to work together as a team though, and the developers did that pretty well. For most heists, you have to choose whether to stealth it, or go in guns blazing, which is another feature that I really like. Team work and strategy in my opinion are the two things that the developers did really well.  Bugs  I didn't notice very many bugs, but the AI is horrible. Cops just stand there shooting you and rarely go into cover. Same for the AI of your team-mates when you don't have 4 players.  Overall  7.5/10  If you don't have any friends to play this with, I don't reccomend getting it. If you have friends to play with, it is a great game to have fun with friends. The price is way too high for the quality you get. The game does manage to be fun most of the times with friends, which is why I reccomend this and gave it a 7.5 instead of a lower score",1

"If you are familar with Warband and how cruel yet rewarding it can be, F&amp;S is similar. Except there are no good parts. It's the perfect russia simulator: 'and then things got worse'  Frustratingly terrible, even on the lowest difficulty. The bandits now steal things from you leaving you pennyless, itemless, and everyone hates you.   Everytime you restart you have to do the awful tutorial that takes 5 minutes.  0/10",-1
"Thousands of fixes, only a few that really work to make this game run on Win8. Aside from that, I remember that this was the first game to make me cry out of sadness rather than rage and frustration. One of the best RPGs I've played in a while and has a -to me- better story than New Vegas. The number one issue that I have with this game that really bugs me is the animations... Aiming down the sights looks like Medal Of Honor PS1 and everyone has a serious case of chicken wing elbow when aiming down the sights in thrid person.",1
"Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken really isn't a bad game. It's just not a good game. It's gameplay works, it is just boring. There is nothing here you haven't seen before. If you have seen it, you have seen it done better. You are just basically running around shooting, jumping and rolling in typical platform style. It does throw in a bit of puzzle solving but nothing big. The missions that have you fighting flying enemies are just a drag. Fly in a circle until you take them out. Every time. Like I said, boring. The music is nice. There were a couple of cut-scenes where the music did not play for me. Can't blame the game for that since it could possibly be my PC, though they worked every other time. I am not going to give it a thumbs down, but it does come close. It is nothing memorable. You may enjoy it for an hour or two. Buy it cheap if you decide to buy it.",1
"Galen Marek, the Starkiller, the most powerfull jedi ever seen. An excelent story, perfect background from the series, completing one of the most interesting periods on the Star Wars saga, the rise of Vader and his young apprentice. You'll feel free to explore everything The Force has to offer to you, strongly recommended to any Star Wars fan. Perfect game, one of my favorites, the only complain possible is its lenght, a little short for some.",1

"So far so good. This is a brilliant Action RPG akin to oldschool Diablo. Combat is fast paced and exciting, a bit repetitive of course since its just click and hit, but the game offers so many abilties that it doesnt get boring.  The game is all about the loot - as it should be - you'll find yourself constantly changing up armour and weapons to find the best fit for you build. Speaking of which, you have sooo many skill options upon lvl up I could spend hours just looking through and planning out the long game for my character.   Billiant game, well worth the nothing you have to pay for it.",1

"Originally I was skeptical about this game in all honesty. And after buying it I have come to understand why Laura Croft got the charafter of the year at the VGX. She's emotional, and sometimes you are asking yourself why she cares so much about her crew, though you already know the reason she is still stuck on an island. I have only gotten 50% through this game, and I wish I got the goty edition (mainly for the extra outfits and tombs). I personally haven't tried out the multiplayer though I did get the survival edition so I should test out those hitman guns one day. Overall this game is a lot better than I had expected originally and I'm glad that I purchased Tomb Raider. Though Square Enix tried to snyc the game with a square enix account and somehow it did not work for myself. But it's always good to look on the better side sometimes. Though I highly suggest if you buy this game don't put the quality on the highest otherwise the game will lag a lot and sometimes irritate you. But the story is great, and makes you go back to find the relics and gps caches. I suggest anyone get this game personally!",1
"Absolutely stunning indie game. If there is one game that will make you cry, it's going to be this one. Easily top 10 worthy for me.",1

So much better and faster paced than boring League of Legends.,1
Threw my laptop at a passerby. 10/10,1
I got mad at my bestfriend cause he didnt save a goal and then I spammed 'What a save!' and then he quit the game and I felt bad so we hugged it out and went to watch youtube in the other room. Dont buy this game.,-1
same thing over and over ,-1
WHAT CAN I SAY: The game rocks. ,1
"A short, cool atmospheric indie game. I went into this not expecting much from a game with a 50p price tag, but enjoyed it while it lasted. It also made me jump in my seat in a couple of times, which I did not expect, which is a plus.  The story goes that you are a deep sea diver exploring a ship wreck of an old 19th (I think) century ship. During your exploration you come across notes detailing the events leading up to the ships wrecking.  A good sound design lends itself to creating a spooky atmosphere for the game. The creaks and groans of the shipwreck, along with other strange noises create an eerie atmosphere.  The game sports simple visuals as are common of small indie games, but they do not detract from the experience.   Gameplay consists of simple platformer and puzzle elements.   All in all a short, sweet indie game to sink your teeth into when you have an hour or so to spare.",1
"Really good game! It's lagg free, despite my computer not being great for games, its easy enough to pick uo, has a selection of hero's to play as, and updates frequently. It's decent gameplay, and it's pretty simple controls, and what not. I'd recommend it, to anyone who'd played games like Smite, before, they're pretty similar!",1
There is nothing better than watching your enemies suffocate.,1
"Fairly easy to get into, the monetization isn't done horrifically. Recent event changes have made it a little more interesting with more dynamic events and Chosen invasions which tend to be the most fun in the game. Good selection of basic classes to try with more advanced classes locked away behind a paywall, although you could in theory unlock them via taking any frame to level 40. Levelling up a second frame is considerably more boring as there's only one path to level through. Second world zone is drab, and travel in it is a hassle. Story missions are pretty entertaining.  Definitely worth a few hours.",1

"This pretty little city is a place where you can carry a full suit of military grade armor, carry a general purpose machine gun on your body and have an RPG on your back  And the civs will freak out only when you put on a pair of sunglasses",1

"I laughed, I cried. It moved me.   Sidenote: Do not expect an RPG.",1
I recomend this game to every one I know and random people on the street too...,1
"It looks great, runs smoothly and makes you feel like an absolute badass.  +++ Soundtrack",1
Too much bugs.,1
Very fun and competitive. Extremly fun to play with friends and use communication to battle other teams. The only thing this game lacks is a community and that can be fixed by PLAYING THE GAME.,1
Great when playing through first. The modding community adds a lot to the replayability of this hack and slash dungeon delving game.,1
"I do enjoy the gameplay, it can be fun and somewhat of a challenge (depending on the difficulty setting). The one big thing that turned me off, however, is the lack of content included in the vanilla game. I've never seen a shooting game with so few guns. It turns me off, big time when I see all of this DLC for sale so shortly after release day. The campaign is short, and only 2 horde style maps, and they both look and play the same. There are positives, for sure: the game looks pretty good, and the x-ray cam can really give some good screen shots. One other negative, that has gotten better due to a patch or two is/was the unpredictable aiming when you are close to a window or ledge. Bullets woulld not hit the target even though the crosshair is spot on.  Overall, I can not recommend this game at it's current price; once it drops below $20 I could honestly say that I would change my recommendation",-1
Great game.. especially when play with friends together..,1
"Brutal exciting 2D game, need really fast reaction time to go past 4th level. 86/100",1
"Alright, let me start out by saying that playing this game without buying a thing is incredibly difficult. If you like challenges, go for it. Otherwise, all DLC is on sale for 2 dollars.   Secondly, I bought the DLC pack, and the game became something that wasn't glamarous, but still somehow fun. It's like an old flash game I use to play, but on a bigger scale.  The AI isn't horrible, but definitely needs some big improvement. Also you can shoot through things that shouldn't be shot through, so take that into account.  One thing people should note is that you can upgrade weapons by only doing a few missions worth of credits. It really does make a big difference when playing this game.  Ultimately, I'd say play it, especially if you have a dollar or two to blow from all your steam trading card money. It's a meesly download of about 200mb, and I am having an alright time playing it. Definitely has some potential later on.",1

"Played football, got in a snow ball fight, Sung carols until someone threw a snowball at me, They wont be throwing anything anytime soon.....Good game by the way, The enviroments are gorgous and the graphics are amazing.",1
"Console style RPG. Maybe for kids 7-10 years old. Not my cup of tea.   Being honest, got this game on a bundle and installed it without thinking about it. 3 Stars of Destiny presents a standard design, with a standard premise and a standard plot. Thinking about it, that's this game problem: it's way too generic and predictable.  Overall, the game it's what you'll expect from it (keeping in mind what's been said before): decent console graphics, juvenile and pseudo-fantastic plot, basic dialog, random encounters and so on. Didn't recommend it since I think that there are quite a bunch of better similar games available.",-1
I like this video game.,1
"Worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ever, banning innocents...",-1
"Biggest disappointment EVER! I am not one to usually cry about these things, but this game SUCKS! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS WAST OF TIME. It's a WoW Clone. Absolute Crap. So angry about my lost money. Will try to get a refund.",-1
"The art is beautiful. The writing is incredible.  Basically, this game follows the X-COM reboot's method of combat. It's not a big budget, state of the art graphics extravaganza. But man, it satisfies that itch. Baulder's gate with turn based combat and sub-machine guns.  You can play a cyborg Ork with an automatic shotgun. Or you can play an elf that summons elemental terrors from piles of garbage. Or all points between. What's not to like?  This game is very adult themed. How adult? One of the character quests is quite possibly the darkest damn thing I've played since the Witcher series. There is also one quest that is so blackly hilarious I fell out of my chair laughing.  After playing through the original twice, I gave this a shot. Unbelievable difference, much tighter game.  Worth the price.  Hoi Chummer. Cut the drek and get your run on. First we take Seattle, then we take Berlin.",1
I have played this game multiple times and every time it is still fun as all get out.,1
It's just Awesome™,1
This game will forever be my favorit mutiplayer game. A team of 4 and communication has never felt so important to me than in this game.,1
"Whilst the graphics haven't aged that well and the story leaves a little to be desired, this game is a huge amount of fun. Playing this game solo is of course possible, but not recommended, as the most fun is to be had playing with friends and/or family. Never before have I been simultaneously outraged at my brother's incompetence (when he panicked and killed himself by dropping a rock on his own head) and grateful that he caused me such joy.  The primary mechanic of combining eight elements to cast all manner of spells is great, if a little hard to get used to. It can provide hours of entertainment (along with the all the pop culture references and strange sayings). I would recommend getting the primary content DLCs as this increases the playtime (and therefore laughs) the game provides.",1

The game is great.   The bugs suck.   If you want to play multiplayer expect to have to reload from saves dozens if not hundred of times due to crash bugs.   Singleplayer is pretty stable. So i highly reccomend the game if you are playing by yourself.   I pseronally play TBS in MP almost all the time so I don't reccomend it.   It has been nearly half a year since the last patch so don't expect the crash bugs to be fixed.,-1
"This is the greatest game in all of history.... if you like to not be able to join the main part of the game because either 1) matchmaking is broken, or 2) nobody plays this garbage. I would've not gotten this refund if I knew how much I loved waiting for forty minutes staring at a circle.",-1

"I've played many games like this. Games like this seem to confuse 'difficult' with 'cluster-♥♥♥♥'.  As soon as you press play, the game goes full speed ahead without you. In order to stop this, you have to click this tiny banner which does not even look like a button. The game throws out notifications all over your screen before you even know what is going on, and even then it is difficult to ascertain what it is trying to convey. The UI is not even remotely intuitive. The AI makes decisions that make no sense at all. Controlling anything is totally unintuitive.   This game is perfect for people who like to feel superior to others because they spent the time fighting the design, rather than playing the game. You can actually lose before you even started getting into things and then lose over and over again after having your first ruler die because they could not produce offspring. There is nothing you can really do to control this besides going 'please respond' to every ruler on the map when looking for a wife. Even then, you can screw yourself. Not like it matters since your ruler will start to gain vices for no explicit reason, impairing his or her ability to rule. Again, you have NO CONTROL over what happens.   You want to simulate the trait rolls in this game? (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU WILL DIE DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS) Get a jar of used medical syringes and some rusty nails you found on the side of a construction site. Smash them on the ground and roll around and see what kills you. It does not really matter, but it's an accurate depiction of what it is like being a character in this game. (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU IDIOT DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS)  Just get CKII. There is much more to do and it's just as 'difficult' without being as obtuse. You won't have to deal with the resolution issues either.   Still, if you absolutely love these types of games, I suppose you can get this one.  Also, it's pronounced 'DOMAIN', not 'DEEMEENZEE'.",1
Very good educational game. 8/8,1
Very fun game but also a very difficult game. (PVP only game),1
"As a lover of space and sandbox games, it's no wonder why i'd like Starbound. But i'm bad at the game, so, sucks to be me. I give it a 9.95/10 for being the best game i've ever played in my life. I bet some will wonder 'Well if this is your favorite game then how come you gave it a lower rating then EXACTLY 10.' and to that I say ' eh'.",1

"An amazing game, but I cannot recommend it due to it's unplayability on current operating systems. The game will stop responding and freeze your computer after around 5-30 minutes of gameplay. Buy at your own risk.  ...but if you use Windows 98, then go for it!",-1
If you are looking for a great RPG in a non-fantasy setting; this game is great. If you do run into some issues do not feel afraid to use console commands to fix broken quests.,1

"First, I want to address the large quantity of negative reviews this game has received. Most of them seem to have expected the wrong thing from this game. This is not a horror game. This is not a puzzle game. This game is not about making decisions. This game is an experience that has very little 'gameplay'. This game is actually not a game.  Now, let's talk about what this game does right. The atmosphere is amazing, the attention to detail is incredible. The setting is mid 90's Oregon, and it captures the spirit of the 90's really well.   This game is less of a game, it's more of a story. This is an experience. Your experience is relayed by the belongings and notes strewn throughout the abandoned house. While the story itself is fairly predictable, the manner in which it is conveyed is as engrossing as you let it become.   Personally, the story resonates very strongly with me, with several parallels to my own life present. But as I said earlier, remember that you are getting a short, linear experience and not a game. If you can get this cheaply, it's an experience as worthwhile as you want it to be.",1

"Pokr Night at the Inventory is a game about - Well, poker. You play at a place called the Inventory, Kinda like a bar for video game characters. Probably the main aesthetic to this game is that you play with four players, all from different games. Even if you (Somehow) dont know any of these people its still a great and worthwhile expirience. Fortunatly, unlike most card games out there, its not stale and boring. The characters chat and make references to their own or other peoples games, which I liked ALOT. And with quirky animations, customisation of decks, varing difficulty, trading cards and achievments - all at a low price, you'd be stupid not to pick up this title.  You also get free tf2 Stuff. Basically why 90% of people buy it. Not even kidding.",1
"Undertale, the game that probably won't be replaced as my number one favourite. You can't really sum up the game with only words. But from the beginning to the end, the game had my attention. I wanted to see how much I could do in this game. Of course I wanted to let my RPG style gamer come forth and start farming monsters from EXP to get LV. But a good friend of mine said I shouldn't kill anything, and well... so did one of the characters 'Toriel,' so I didn't, I ended up doing a true pacifist run and my god, I loved it, all the way through, playing with either a controller or keyboard it was great! The music in the game for different events, fights, ect. But all the theories envolving the character 'sans' got my deeper in the fandom of Undertale, I played the game over and over, Pacifist runs, Neutral runs, even the Genocide run twice. I won't go too far into how amazing one of thr characters is though. Let's keep in mind that not all games are perfect, and look at something I found incomplete. The royal scientist before the one you meet in the game, 'Alphys.' The unknown character of W.D.Gaster, while doing a normal run, the most you will probably notice are a few lines of text, one being the wrong number song, the other being something said by the riverman. Anyway, W.D.Gaster only brings up questions, and when you look for answers, you find one answer that will bring up three more questions, not to mention the 'mstyman' sprite that can only be found by altering the game files. The other characters you can find are Gaster Followers 1, 2, and 3, and the grey monster kid. The gaster followers are all grey, so I assume the grey monster kid is also a follower of gaster, but I don't know. Back to the good things about this game, there are too many to mention in 12 reviews, with very little bad things about this game, I suggest buying the game. It was probably my best idea so far, and as far as the story line a lot of people might have expected to read about, you aren't getting any spoilers from me. If I had to rate this game, I would have to give it 9/10, there are a few plot holes, but it makes up for them all with the game-play.",1
"Superfun not so typical Tower-Defense game, great presentation, graphics, setting and atmosphere. Highly recommended! And during the current weekend deal offer it's only € 1.79 !",1
"  Very interesting take on a card game. You don't actually battle your opponent directly until the end of an adventure, or 'quest'. Your hand is literally your adventure. You have to earn gold each round to buy buffs, weapons, effects, armor, even debuffs for monsters you place (that you have to fight yourself).   Monsters give effects based on how powerful they are, some of the strongest monsters will give you permanent buffs for the remainder of the match, nuke your opponents health or even double your gold. Depending how you fare on your journey, which weapons and armors you played and what monsters you faced determine how powerful (or how good as dead) you are for the final duel.  Card packs are quite expensive with in game currency however, and it does seem there are some VERY powerful cards not available from just leveling classes. Although you can disenchant cards for dust which you use to craft anything of your choice, better the card; more dust you need. You can also create custom decks based around Runescape heroes. There's a mage who harasses the enemy hero during their quest, a warrior who can become insanely tanky and even deal damage and heal based on his armor amount and a vampire who can drain monsters and her enemy for healing and inflict extremely high damage when close to death. There is also a rogue and a blacksmith but I haven't tried them, I've not seen either of those classes do well however.  It's a short download, free, and very fast to learn thanks to a no nonsense tutorial. I would recommend this to any TCG/CCG, strategy and even RPG fan.",1
One of the few stealth game i've played to completion. This game knows how to do it.,1
"Ive selected my region 'EU' Ive got 40-60 ping 120-150 fps stable but im still lagging, Let me give you an advice refund the game or dont buy it the servers are just getting worse and worse on PC if you want to play the game buy it for console as this game is impossible to be good at without and controller so you could just play on console instead, if you dont have a console then simply dont buy the game.",-1
Very fun game!! Not overly complicated but keeps me entertained. Not a game if you want actual simulation but looking for something to be able to jump in and out of. Best 2 bucks and change i ever spent.,1
"With a lot of visual novels, there's a real hump to get over as they take absolutely forever and a day for the plot to actually start. This is no exception; the setup goes on for an age and *seems* like it isn't going anywhere. It certainly doesn't appear to have any relevance to the blurb.  And then the plot starts. And what happens as the plot starts rolling downhill is made so much more powerful by the aeons and aeons of setup that precedes it. It wouldn't be nearly as good without the amount of time put into establishing the characters, and their odd little world, and the initial mood of the thing.  Stick with it and it will reward you.  (note: if you like your visual novels with choices in, steer well clear)",1

you can play minecraft in this game,1
"Don't get me wrong.. This is a great game. Its polished and basically bug free. There is a ton of content in this game and plenty of places to explore, discover and fight.. But what makes this game undesirable for me is the Micromanaging.. When you start getting a stock pile things.. it becomes very tedious to organizing items and you start to get bored once you acquire the higher tier gear.",-1
 A masterpiece of classic platforming,1
"Much more fleshed out and better realized than the original, but still suffering from the same problems except they're even more obvious this time around thanks to gameplay additions that simply clash with some of the core game systems. I'm mainly talking about stealth and tomb sections that really show off Assassin's Creed's finicky controls clearly not built for that level of precision. Putting all that aside, what works REALLY works and won't grate on you after ten minutes like the original did - story is more cohesive albeit a traditional revenge story, gameplay is varied up a bit and collectibles are actually worth collecting. Also features fisticuffs with a fat man in a dress and wacky totally-not-aliens ending. WTF, man?",1
"Now I understand why Alien Isolation's sales were slow or poor.  A lot of people were turned off of Sega's line of Alien games because of this game.   For those people who have refrained from buying Alien Isolation: RETHINK IT... AI is a superior game to a lot of games out there and it is more Survival Horror (like Outlast only better) than anything.  Alien Colonial Marines is 'imitation CoD' mixed with some of the older Playstation Alien games from the 1990's.   Graphics wise you can see there is a mix of good and bad. Some computer screens you come across look great.. others are so blocky and out of focus it makes you wonder if it were merely copied and pasted in a rush.  The Multi-player, at least the co-op seems fun --at first. Then you realize that even the Bughunt DLC requires 4 players... which is not good. Should have been 2-4 per team.  The A.I. for your allies in single player mode is awful. You save marines... and then some of them stand there like idiots instead of doing what they need to do like... getting back to basecamp.  The main story is not great and could have been done better... there should have been more 'helping marines live' so they can help you defend in certain spots later on (i.e the more you save the bigger the group you'll have later etc).  Locking doors so you cannot run back and get the Auto-turret for one scene was not a good idea either.  There were some interesting spots, like wandering around in the sewers against the elderly aliens (lol).... but even that entire scenerio could have played out better or scarier.  I will say that I think some of the DLC's helped this game (I'm told Bughunt is good when you got enough friends to actually get it going)... and the 'Statis Interrupted' DLC was interesting. Similar to Alien Isolation (perhaps like a rough draft of it)... where you are a chick and go around without weapons and find your way to point B...   All in all... this game could have... should have been better. Multi-player was not appealing at all. Period. Sega NEEDS TO LEARN how to set up Lobby systems.  The lobby system in Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, for example, is EASY and not limited in what you can set up. This game's multiplayer was a huge turn-off.  I got one friend on here who has the game and we are trying to do the Co-op game and so far it's going okay ... but we don't have enough to do other multiplayer maps. sigh.  One final word to those who can still do patches:  It is never too late to do a game over-haul patch. You can fix some issues for the game and perhaps clean up some of the bugs. Gearbox, this dud is on your reputation, not the company you tried to outsource to.  You guys are going to have to live with all the negative reviews unless you can heed this suggestion and fix what you know needs to be fixed.  Alien Isolation's sales... suffer because you guys dropped the ball.  Fix your bugs please.",-1

This game is great , its free and playable being free too and also has a great consept to how the war is played out . I would easiley say one of the best WWII mmos out there .",1

"You can easily get to the end boss with levels and equipment that aren't enough to actually kill him, and to rectify that you would need to reload an hour old save. Even switching to Easy difficulty after doing all the other stuff on Normal was not enough to finish the last battle. Other than that it's nice enough game, but this sort of thing is just unacceptable game design failure.",-1
"This was definitely nostalgic and a throwback to those old NES games like Island, Metroid, Mickey Mouse, Nemo's Dreamland and even Mario. The colors, the distortion of the TV, it all emulated what you were staring at back in the day in the darkness. Playing for hours in the night. It is rather a straightforward platformer. I was not hooked on any sort of story or 'atmosphere' and didn't really grasp the purpose of the lands (bouncy mushrooms, painful water, slamming stoneheads, etc), but it was still a really great game to launch yourself back into the past. I wouldn't pay 7.99 for this unless you were REALLY hurting for an oldschool type game, and they did a VERY good job of reliving those times.",1
"This wonderfully funny and enjoyable RPG consumed my life for weeks. It was with giddy excitement that I approached each new quest and advanced each level. The malleability of the gameplay is incredible: you seem to be able to craft almost anything and accumulate a vast array of different spells and skills. Unlike many RPGs, none of the abilities or skills were redundant, and you can really only succeed with a well-rounded squad who can deal with situations both in and out of combat. The turn-based queue combat requires a lot more thought and strategy than the usual action-RPG format of Diablo or Torchlight, and I found it infinitely more fun. 10/10",1
"For a game that I spent 24 cents on, it was a pretty fun romp. Probably not going to play it again though.",1
Its a great game nothin more needs to be said really. I must of invested over 600+ hours over 2 accounts. I mainly use it for DLR now however. Be interesting to see what LFD3 brings.,1

"An amazing MMORPG for those on a budget or not. The game includes all the usual PVP, PVE, and world gaming events you expect from any MMO and then throws in its own personal twist with Rifts and zone events. Between warfronts, rifts, zone events, pvp, crafting, artifact hunting and much more you are sure to never be lost in this game and without a dull moment.",1
"I hope that you get to do a lot of welding in afterlife, Shitbot. We'll remember you!   Also, this game is so incredibly underrated. If you look for the game on Youtube most related videos have less than 10k views. I mean this game has been here for more than two years now and I didn't find out it existed until a few days ago. Great game, but it makes me sad that it doesn't receive the recognition it deserves.",1

I know ten hours isn't alot, but I feel it's enough for me to give a positive review. Honestly I haven't written many reviews if any.  Do I think the game is perfect? No, there is plenty that could be improved. Do I think the game is worth the price and worth playing? Yes, at times it can be a bit annoying having all your traders die to pirates, but for the price it's definitely worth trying.",1

"Updated 12/22/2016  Since my original review the game has made several strides in fixing the main issues. The game is a ton of fun to play and makes for some exciting moments. There are still issues with matchmaking and some minor balance issues but the developers are on the right path and make the game better with every update.    Old Review: The game is a ton of fun, when it works. I was hoping the new patch note would fix the match making issues but it only made it worse. The buffed the survivors so much that the killers are now the hunted (especially when flashlights are used) and as a result no one plays killers. No killers no game. Also survive with friends is still broken and you almost always get kicked back to the main menu after it begins to search for a game.   If the devs re-balance the game and fix survive with friends I would gladly recommend this game. But as it stands this game is dying a slow and painful death.",1

"Indie gaming at its finest! Dust is a beautiful, fun, fast paced hack n slash game set in a Metroidvania type world.

If you want a game involving planes that requires almost no skill to play, this is your game.  I would only recommend this to people that want an action based experience similar to Call of Duty.  Remove DFM and QTEs and it could have been playable.",-1
"What can I say? It's Borderlands.  Ok guess I can say more. Borderlands is a lot of fun. Especially with friends but even alone is a great game. It's funny. The game play is like most rpg. Ya, there are a lot of fetch quests, but it was not that big of a deturant for me. Ya, I know it says 30 hours, but I actually own this for my playstation. Got it on sale here to play with my friend.   In the end this game is worth getting at full price. So few games are these days. Oh and pick up Borderlands 2.",1
"Oh boy, where does one start! MS Revolution will go down as one of the most unremarkable and forgettable titles around. It felt like going back in time to a playstation 1 game, the graphics are blotchy and outdated, even on the highest settings.   This game offers nothing that the title suggests, there is nothing revolutionary about MS R. The game's weaknesses are all too evident:   - Laughable AI  - Stone Age Graphics  - Dull Engine Sounds  - Horrible Car Physics  If you truly are mad enough to still buy this broken and hideous game then at least do yourself a favour and research it on the net. Look up all the videos you can and then decide whether you're still keen to invest in this game. I decided to ignore the bad reviews posted, now i'm $14 dollars down and left with a driving game that has been uninstalled.  Don't pay attention to the amount of time spent on this game, i've spent far more than what is recorded. I never play online, when a game downloads i disconnect from the internet to play all my games offline. Please take the advice to research this title before jumping in to purchase, it is a major step backwards that simply isn't worth investing in.",-1
i love almost everything about this game. One of the only things to gripe about is that the Completely Overkill Pack is gone forever. unless i pay some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ $1000 on ♥♥♥. i dont understand the situation fully but it seems like they must hate money or something.,1
"A surreal, foreboding freebie title, Close Your Eyes doesn't have much going for it in the 'game' department, but more than makes up for it with its offputting atmosphere and a creepy, minimalistic story that plays out with the unrestrained logic of a nightmare.  There's not a lot to say about this one other than try it out. It's free and is less than two hours long, you literally have no excuses. Absolutely not a trip to miss.",1
Still better then CS:GO for me! I love it so much!,1
"I never would have bought this game were it not included in the Humble Indie Bundle, and I must say that it would have been my horrific loss. I had thought that, like denim overalls, top-down shooters were out of date and I had outgrown them. Not so. Jamestown brings back the top-down shooter in an incredibly engaging way. There is no shortage of enemies to destroy, and when each one explodes in a shower of coins it gives a particular feeling of satisfacction. Not to say it will be easy - they swarm and their firing patterns mean some artful dodging is required if you want to reach the final boss with enough lives intact. Though the single player is spectacular enough, the multiplayer just pushes it over the top. Though there is no online play, crowding around a computer with your friends and screaming at the screen has its own unique charm.",1
The LPG tank has a benefit in this game.,1
Very good game. 10/10 would get ♥♥♥♥ed by 5 clans again. also get it on sale for like 5 bucks if you can and get a friend to play co op with too,1
"First off, I am going to say that this game is a decent game, I do not recommend it because at its current price I do not think it is worth it.   Pros -  Story - The story is actually an interesting concept, and for the most part it plays out decently. There are a few moments in the story that irk me, mainly because more could've been done with that moment, or it basically forces you into an option you wouldn't do yourself.  Combat - The combat is engaging, I guess some people have found it hard, while some have found it easy. I am one of the ones that finds it easy, its a bit difficult starting out. Once you level up it gets easier, I went Technomancer, with Dagger and Gun. The gun makes fights a whole lot simplier, so I would recommend the dagger and gun build for people who want an easier time in combat.  Graphics - Graphics are good, not as good as Witcher 3 but still passable, and the animations are better than their previous titles where everything felt stiff, again, not as good as Witcher 3 but still better.  Upgrade System - The weapon/armor upgrade system is in this game just as it was in like Bound by Flame, very simple upgrades all around though, basically weapons have 4 upgrades crit, dmg, distruption(stagger), and armor pen. Theres also multiple levels of the upgrades. These upgrades also give the items visual upgrades which I really enjoyed seeing, just means they put in a little extra work to the upgrade system. I still think more could've been done with this system, but its nice to have an upgrade system regardless.  Cons -  Companion AI - The companion AI in this game is a joke, half the time I will look around and I will have 3 enemies on me while my companions will have 1 and somehow I will beat the 3 enemies while both my companions are almost dead and the 1 enemy they were fighting is at 90% hp. Its just really bad, the only thing companions in this game are good for is to soak up some attention from enemies but sometimes that doesnt even work.  Companion Stories - Its sad, but there is pretty much only 1 companion that had a story that actually made me care about them in anyway. The rest of them were either generic stories or just werent well done.  Traveling - Ok this would have to be my biggest gripe with the game. It reminded me of when I played through Dragon Age 2 with always going back and forth through places I have already been, except the respawn rates of enemies are so fast that by the time you get back from a 2 minute mission they will have respawned and you will have to fight them again, and the quest givers like to hold back quests to extend the play time of the game so you get a quest, go complete it, come back to turn it in, than he gives you another quest in the same area you were just in. Really annoying.  Voice Acting - The voice acting in this game is mediocre at best, especially the main character. He just sounds the same no matter what emotions he should be portraying.  Karma System - So I seriously have no idea what this system does to be honest, I truly can't think of anything to say about it besides when you bend down to drain an enemy(kill them) a popup shows up saying -1 karma, or if you do something good a popup shows up saying +1 karma. I never found any point in the game where my karma actually affected anything. I put this under cons because a useless feature in a game takes away time from features that they could've refined more if they focused on them rather than putting in a feature that doesnt do anything besides doing simple math.  Exploration - It really isn't worth it to do any exploration, through out the whole game I found 6 'purple' items, 2 of them I didn't even wear because they were worse than what I was already wearing, 2 pieces were off a boss from a quest chain, the other 2 you don't even get till you are right outside the last boss encounter. The majority of equipment upgrading I found was off enemies or from vendors, not from chests. I only found 2 purple pieces in chests.  Weapons/Armors - The amount of weapons and armors in this game is a let down, but thats not the reason this is a con to me, just like the Gothic series that had a minimal amount of different armors, this game doesn't make the new armor or weapons feel like a true upgrade. Take the Technomancer gear sets, from all the armor I saw on vendors or that I found through out the world they had 3-4 different chest pieces, 2-3 boots, 4 gloves, 1-2 helmets. Sure you can mix and match but since the only pieces that could get fluid regeneration on them were the technomancer equipment I felt that I had to wear that equipment. The heavier armors had more variety but since I didn't use them besides for equiping my companion with them, it just didn't have that much of an impact on me.  All in all, this game is decent at best, I never got one of those moments that made my heart race or gave me chills that I have gotten with so many other RPGs out there now a days. I would recommend waiting till this game is 20 bucks or less before snagging it up.",-1

"Battlefront II has to be one of the best Steam games availible on the market.  At an affordable price under £10 (even less during sales...!), Experience the many battles throughout the Star Wars universe from the eyes of a soldier, Jedi or Sith. You can Make use of Thermal Detonators, Tanks, Blaster Rifles, Turrets; Heck, not to mention Star Wars' most iconic symbol - A lightsaber.   Hours of endless entertainment provided to gamers who really love a shooter, with a twist of star wars in every corner. The variety of gamemodes availible really help cover a wider audience. For example, those who like to use their minds will love the Galactic Conquest gamemode - commanding your fleets and conquering planets for total victory. If you like a game with a good emotional understanding - the campaign does an adequate job. Or if you're the person that simply likes to blow sh** up, Instant action.  Another vital piece of this game is how the game manages to live on - even with the discontinued use of the Gamespy servers, the modding community is very large and helps make the game even more fun and specified to your 'taste' should I put it. (But then again, who isn't having fun with this game?)   As you can guess, I'd thoroughly reccomend Battlefront II for all gamers out there, especially those who would like to play games such as Battlefield, but don't have a 'beefy' computer, allowing many more people to enjoy this masterpiece. Despite the game being fairly old - it manages to maintain it's spot as one of my favourite games, 10 years on. Definitely a '10' from me.",1

"I've played DMC3 and DMC4 enough to say that this is an almost perfect game in the gameplay aspect even if it has backtracking and some tedious parts.  Gameplay is refined and Vergil's skill ceiling is insane, Trish is hilarious and Lady is a pleasure to master.  So, I recommend it.  However, optimization is terrible this time around, and I hope they patch it, it's Capcom so I don't expect them to do anything competent other than porting the game itself, but I have a little hope, I get some freezes every time I do a first summoned sword on a map and multiple stingers when I play on full 720p.  A Radeon R7 260x should be enough, so there is no excuse, after the game sells enough on consoles, patch this thing.",1

"I must say I am enjoying this more and more as I go along. I have even stopped my WoW subscription. So in short, I would definitely say you should at very least give this a go.  On the upside, there are so much content that you don't mind paying the few $/month to be a supporter. Which will give you those points that you need for smooth sailing. You can learn all the crafts and skills. So you can switch classes and take up professions that works with that class without losing progress on anything. The crafting system has got nice depth to it and still makes sense.   There are a lot of skills/spells for every class that allows you to build your character the way that fits your play style. You can even use skills from the other classes in your build.   Missions missions missions. There are so many. Dailies that for skills, missions for reputation, missions for craft rewards, side missions and main quests. So if you like missions you wont run out quick. Alternatively, if you don't, you can still dungeon grind your way through levels easy enough.  Finally, the community is nice and helpful. I have done tons of dungeon runs and never got called a noob or derp if I got stuck not knowing how to proceed when doing a dungeon the first time. People are friendly and helpful, which is rare these days.   I am likely missing a lot of things I wanted to add here, but I am rushing to get back in game.  There are a few hings that gets to me personally, like small stack sizes in inventory and a lot of back and forth running in quests, but I can also understand why this is so. It is not a pay2win, although it leans towards it. You CAN make it without paying, but it would be quite difficult.",1
"I do not know where to start but I'll start out by saying that this game is NOT the same Knight Online that old school players from 2004-2008 era played. It used to be the BEST mmorpg for me and for lots of people, we skipped school to play it, we got fired from our jobs because we couldn't wake up in the morning to go to work as we were too busy playing KO until late hours of the night. It was a passion for us, it was a legend. And now it's a monstrosity, everything about this game has been designed solely to FORCE you into paying money for it since NTT game bought the game.  When we remember all the good times we had in the old mysterious world of Knight Online, we get nostalgic and want to get back on it but we cannot because it is no longer there. This is what lies beneath all the bad reviews about this game. Heck, the reason I'm here writing this review is because the old soundtrack of Knight Online happened to be on the suggested videos list on a YouTube video I was watching. Listening to it evoked so many memories and I came here to get it off my chest.  Thank you NTT game, for ruining the game we loved.  If you're someone who has never played Knight Online before, turn back and walk away. This is not a game anymore, it's a cash grab facility.",-1
"This game is great, maybe an 8/10  Pros: -I see alot of action in this game -Average number of players -Gamemodes just made this game alot better Cons: -Bad menu -Graphics not that good -*Sigh* Only if this game had more weapons",1
"When I first saw this game being played, it reminded me of fish in an aquarium, just with the ability to shoot lasers at each other. Even now, after I know it's a space game, it still has that organic look.  This is a great game. It runs very well on an older laptop, and when things get too intense with the graphics, the program simply steps down speed rather than crashes. The design interface for the ship editor is very well done and you can zoom in and out. It has a lot of things you can use, but just enough so you do not get overwhelmed from too much inventory to choose from.  Piloting your ships is a little tricky, since it involves the cursor and the keyboard and even then you have settings to choose from. My best analogy of piloting a ship in Reassembly is like riding a horse, where you use rein to control the speed and steer your steed.  The conquer the universe mode is pretty straightforward and you got lots of time to build up resource. The tutorial helps you get things rolling though I was hoping for more, like for example what exactly am I scooping off these asteroids? To date, I've never been wiped off the map for being too slow. If you beat an agent, you unlock a faction to play.  THe sandbox mode? Okay, that's the first real negative on this game. I'm old enough to have played games that involved you using complex commands in a text editor to create the scenerio before the game began, so let me tell you I've never seen a sandbox mode that involved command language since the 1980s. This would have been acceptable for the 1980s but this is the 21st century, and most computer users are not programmers. They would expect an Activision-esque style of interface where you select number of players, difficulty level, type of victory scenerio and so on. AFter seeing a dazzling UI, asking the user to create a sandbox match using command line languages gives this game a unfinished look. It's not a deal breaker. I got more than my money's worth out of it, but I would have loved to see what the sandbox mode was like.  My verdict? Worth it, lot of replayability value and you will have hours of fun designing things and watching them go blooey. Just skip the sandbox mode.",1

"Fun side-scrolling crafting game with a lot of option available. Like cooking. There is so much cooking. I can't tell you how many omelette's my character has scarfed down. It has a pretty fun exploration element to it, with lots of different planets and environments to discover. Everything has a randomly generated structure or two for you to delve into!  On the downside, I've run into multiple performance issues. The game doesn't seem well-optimized and lags terribly when there is too much happening on the screen, despite having a radeon R9 380X.",1
Actually not bad at all...,1
"The creators of Bastion know how to take a simple story and enhance it with beautiful settings, music, and narrative which makes it one of the most memorable experiences I've had in gaming.",1
"Some of my thoughts after about 40 minutes of playing:  - The game is buggy, It has crashed a few times, and I have experienced glitches in the game forcing me to relaunch it. - Music is repetitive uninspiring. - This game needs more depth. A good example is a budget option for running your newspaper that rewards you for selling more newspapers. - Choices are extremely limited for editing articles and layout.  The first 10 minutes were fun, but quickly got repetitive. This game has so much potential, it just needs the core concepts to be fleshed out more.",-1
"Note: Steam achievements are rather annoying, unlocked several achievements at once due to being a previous player before steam version came out (only after one achievement was unlocked that i did not have and then all achievements previously unlocked have unlocked)  Been a player since the Closed beta, they have seriously come a long way and some of it is not for the better of the game...  They have revamped the resources almost 4 different times in the game, changed up the Crafting three seperate times, changed up leveling the frames twice, and changed PVP/PVE functions about twice as well (PVP more than PVE).  The game is heavily based around skill of the player with a hint of luck with the gear related, so long as you keep moving you generally will survive most conflicts against the Chosen and the creatures of the world.   There is a very diverse variaty of Weapons and Frames to choose from ranging from the classic Archtypes as follows  Assault: General class has abilities that can be both used for close combat and long range, your basic build types but branches out into some more exclusive types for Heavier damage or crowd control  Dreadnaught: Heavy Class, your massive brick wall that can just take everything and everyone at once and still keep on going, has rapid fire weapons and shield type abilities, branches off into classes that can create shields, become walking armories, or just straight up bullet spitter.  Recon: Long range support type class, does have some close combat capabilities but eventually branches out into a long range support class that can be utterly devistating to anything, can cloak itself with certain abilities and even create havoc against the enemy targets by making them attack clones or other enemy troops. Branches off into Heavier sniper type frames armed with Bolt action rifles or charged energy rifles  Medic: Healer class, starts off very slow and rather hard to level unless you have some friends but after a while it can branch off to become a very self sufficient frame. Can revive faster than any other class and has abilities to poison and even set some traps if players know what they are doing. Branches off to become a strong healing frame or a more offensive DPS frame  Engineer: The Supporter class, can create anything and everything that has a gun attached to it really, can create support turrets, landmines, knockback weapons, and stations that give ammo/health/armor and boosters for damage. Can branch off into a stronger defensive class with more turrets and supportive drops, or an offensive buffer that can boost friendlies weapons and use a railgun.  Overall there are quite a few combinations in the end, the game is fun and players who have been around enjoy it and oddly enough still come back to see what else is new with the game...  8.5 out of 10 ",1
-Great gameplay. -Interesting story. -Awesome music. Team sonic should take notes from these guys.,1
Very good team work game. game play could be fixed up a bit such as melee struggles with zombies and more content added would be awesome! customization would be epic.,1
good game and it has a good phicics engin,1
Love it.,1
realy good game 9.99/10,1
"I've only played this game for a couple hours and thoroughly enjoy it. One of the best games ive played just because of how addicting this game gets. I played the demo and was interested by what the rest of the game must be like so i bought it. At first it was hard to play but once you get the hang of it its crazy addicting. I had no problem putting in 100+ hours and this game with mods, i had to change my pants. I 10000% recommend this game to everyone, its incredible.",1
"this a a very relaxing and short game. I personally really enjoyed it.  exept for that one final puzzle. really, ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle. like half of the time I spent on this game is in that final puzzle.   but ignoring That One Puzzle, it is a cheap and very enjoyable game. if you have the money I recommend you buy it.",1
"Get this game if you have friends and it's on sale. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's going to be a fun and pleasant experience. This game is a little glitchy with the AI, classes don't matter, because weapons are shared. If you like hardcore games with all the odds against you, then maybe this game is for you. And playing alone, missions are almost impossible.",1
Grat design and well animated but too repetitive IMO.   Grab it on sale it's not a 'bad' game.,-1
I have had this game for almost 2 weeks now. I have played as much as I can and yet still have to discover so much more. 10/10. Brilliant. nuf said,1

Awesome! This game is more fun than any other Sonic game out there (except Colors) and I don't know why everyone complains about the story. I love it! 10/10 for sure!,1
"Great game! I followed the directions about deleting the Uplay thing, then re-installing the Uplay thing, and it worked great. Really nice game!  I followed Korey's advice, which I copied: There is a Uplay issue. Fix: go to  uplay.com  and download it, make an account, register your game under the games tab, minimize it, go to steam, play. Boom, money not wasted.",1

"This game sucks buffalo butt dumps, pre-rendered backgrounds, short ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, horribly linear story, no loot system, awful interface, and the ♥♥♥♥ing graphics are about 5 years above the original for SNES. Making a game that has steam workshop capability for the soul fact that the community might salvage your game is ok. BUT the developer didnt give the options to the users to fix this exploded ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so everything the community churns out will be along the same line as the 'Dead mans switch' story'. Its like drawing a comic book with a broken hand and everytime someone offers to draw for you, you break thier hand to, so they cant outdo you.",1
"looks a little bit like a cheap version of cs.. controls aren't that easy to handle. the video and the pictures on the storepage looks promising, but the actual gameplay isn't...  it is more realistic than other shooters i've played. but it ain't that fun.. its still under development, i have that they keep working on this game, who knows some day i like it..",-1

"The story's alright, but since Rockstar thinks no one plays it anymore they don't update it with anything new.  GTA Online, however, they do update. Very often, nice cars, nice new features and lots of people playing. Unfortunately, the economy is screwed. More than our own. Unless you like grinding your ♥♥♥ off in missions for hours on end, there's not much for you here.   Go spend your shekels elsewhere.",-1
"This is a great game, with a few bizarre snags.  1) This is not a released game, yes it isn't in early acces and yes it it has a presence on other platforms. However, this game is no more complete than Star Citizen is. Keep that in mind no matter what the developers say. It seems that the only reason they 'Released' this game was to beat SC to the punch and generate cash flow.  2) This game has a massive open world, with lots of things to do. It's almost like an MMO with the option to go solo. It also has all the addicting MMO things. Like camping for a spawn (waiting for the right mission in a station) or getting ganked by level 10000000 players that in this game are represented by people with huge ships that can tear you to shreds. Just like warcrack or any other MMO a great deal of your time is spent doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. You wait for a cooldown of 30 seconds then a charge up time of 10 seconds every time you jump between stars. This is the main mechanism of travel in the game. Most of the time you spend playing the game it's waiting around over and over again.   You do that hyperspace cooldown 4-10 times until you run out of fuel then refuel at a star for another 30 seconds to a minute. That's 20 minutes in cooldowns alone to travel between places. Long journeys can be 30-99 star hops like this. This game is just absolutely filled with random cooldowns and time wasters to inflate the amount of time. It also has a reputation system for different factions, with a catch the game tries to force you to sink time into it by making your reputation with these factions decay if they're not tended to with quests. Also like an MMO without expansion packs this game has maybe 4gigs of assets that are recycled and reskinned over and over again space stations are the equivalent of MMO towns and there are around 6 different types including planetary each with various reskins. It's as if Ironforge was cloned and pasted around the warcraft map over and over.     3) Dying has real consequences that can feasibly wipe all of your progress if you don't have enough in game currency to cover your ship past the noob ship it's possible to lose ALL your progress in the game. For example I purchase a big shiny ship I have been saving for by sinking 400+ hours into the game. It cost me 400 million in game credits. I now have 0 credits. The game uses an insurance system to repurchase your ship so if you die with 0 credits in your account and cannot cover the cost of the ship you lose ALL your progress and are back to the noob ship.  4)The game is filled with hundreds of bugs as it is in practice still a beta. However, customer service is often willing to help you if you lost credits or items or whatever because they know the game is buggy as all hell.  5)My biggest and most bizarre rant is on the tutorial. There's one for controls, combat, docking and navigation. They go into the bare minimum of details and this game expects you to figure everything out on your own. You are dropped into the world and not really given any direction or instructions. This is similar to old MMO titles like Ultima Online when it was run by Origin. It's really up to you to research crafting, game tutorials and other things by going on youtube and pulling up either offical videos or much better player tutorials. This game is in desperate need of a singer player mode that explains the mechanics and finer details that are required to give new players a direction. IE: Here's how you do mining, exploration, trading, etc etc. This is made even sader by the fact the game has a built in google esque galaxy map that gives you all the tools you need to find things like trade routes and best places to mine and the like it just doesn't explain how to use it.   The whole thing reminds me of a certain TV show where engineers build software and never give it out to regular people to beta test and then are confused when normal folks have no idea how to get it to work.",-1
METAL GEAR SOLID V: The Phantom Pain One of the best games in the series ?  In my opinion hideo kojima has out done himself on this one  from the story to graphics and sound its just flawlessy put together   Also be sure to check out MGS:GZ first   As it plays a key role in knowing just what the f**k is going ON  hope to see you guys and girls online early next year for some metal gear mayhem,1
"Not long ago I came across a pathetic remake of ReVolt, it was even insulting to see a beautiful game like revolt copied in such a pathetic way.   But Super Toy Cars, is something else. It's fun to play. The tracks are Re-Volt-ish style, but are original.  Pros: I like the idea of building your own tracks and sharing them. The driving is very responsive, and definitely more realisting than some other games on steam. The soundtrack is really good, even though there are only a few songs.  Cons: Sound Effects are missing on some spots on the tracks. Multiplayer is there, but unfortunately nobody plays. The graphics may be improved, maybe adding more objects that drivers can interract with on the tracks. I think also that if not improved the price should drop significantly.  Even though the game can be improved I enjoy playing it, I'll definitely play until I unlock all the cars, paints styles and achievements. I can't wait to play this game with friends, I'm sure it will be a lot of fun.",1
"i know why people complains getting black screen after meet seirno at magris academy after his dialog ' what! is that ...'  either  use 5 people on party using tacticial tome   or   need to talk to all people in academy.  i faced that black screen but restart and load my save game then go back, i reduce my party to only main character alone and talk to all people then talk to seirno, after that i dont receive any blackscreen",1
Very fun and realistic. Great grafics and satisfying explosions.Srry if i misspelled something.,1
"Beautiful.  I don't play many indie games, but when I do, I hope for games just like Dust. The artwork and sceneary for the game is beautiful. The settings change with every level and none overstay their welcome. The soundtracks for each area are seperate with a few notable ones that simply had me back just to hear the themes again.  This game made me love side-scrollers again. Platforming is fun, but not too difficult to distract you. Combat is pretty well a lightshow, with small, but effective combos.   For a game that is usually on sale, you cannot go wrong.",1
"The only good game in the series. Dragon Age is a fantastic role playing experience, I put nearly 400 hours into the PS3 version which is crap compared to the PC version obviously. The game is epic, engrossing, and has more than enough content for its price.",1
"This game is great. . . When it comes to the story. The plot is fantastic and I played through to the end because I was so interested in where it was all going; the story literally grabs you and pulls you down, it's presented very well through the narration (patrick ♥♥♥♥ing stewart.)  The game play kind of sucks though. The camera is fix and it makes combat kind of wonky. Particularly with the keyboard and mouse it's a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. The combat itself isn't very difficult and doesn't give too much challenge which is nice if you're someone who would like to play just for the story, but because of the strange camera it does at times get kind of frustrating. I remember one particular area where the camera would switch between two entirely different angles (from top down kind of, to from the side) if you moved to a certain spot while fighting some difficult enemies.   It's not a piece of ♥♥♥♥, but it definitely was not done as well as it could have and it ♥♥♥♥s the game play to a fair extent.",1
This game is real gud,1
At first I thought this was daxter and jack but I was wrong.,-1
The tutorials are horribly written and extremely difficult to follow. This game is entirely too stressful.,-1
"I absolutely love this game. If you're a fan of the Supernatural and being badass, this game is for you. What I really like is that you can play alone or with friends and the challenges are the same.  I've only played for 40 hours, but after playing some other multiplayer games with toxic communities, this one is not one of them. Everyone is very friendly, and most times are willing to help and teach the beginners. It is also a very forgiving game. If you don't like a weapon set up you may have picked before, you can easily switch to another set and begin storing points for them.  The only thing I find lacking is the character customization as the males and females have a set body figure. You can make them shorter or taller but their body shape remains the same. I also think that more customization would be highly benefitial to the game, but I do like that you can wear anything you want and it's not covered by ugly suits of armor.  All in all, I recommend this game for the player base and the gameplay, as well as the story.",1
"I was recommended this game by a friend. He challenged me to beat his highscore. I sat down, pressed play- and 7 hours of playing later - I died. A combination of over-stimulation, exhaustion and forgetting to drink water killed me. This is me writing a review from heaven. But I gotta go, I need to play this game some more. Pls send help.",1

Wow this is old.,1
"I'm not much for giving in-depth reviews, so I won't go into details, but I have to say something about Quern. This game is fantastic. I'm a big fan of the four original Myst games (and realMyst) and I'm always looking for more like those. Many are similar, but very few hit that particular tone and feeling. Quern definitely fits that ever-growing Myst-shaped hole in my soul.   A great but somewhat subtle detail is that as you progress through the game, the puzzle elements and invironments you interact with become more and more technologically advanced, which nicely parallels and illustrates the growth and experience of the mysterious Professor you learn more about along the way.  Another amazing element to this game is the way new challenges you encounter continue to use previously solved puzzles, locations, and items in a way that makes everything feel more connected and relevant, rather than simply being a bunch of isolated puzzles.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves puzzle-based adventure games.  In case you'd like to see my playthrough of the game, this link is a good place to start:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdmm5UWA-t0 ",1

"If you want to hear these stupid idiots talk about nothing and play poker more slowly than necessary, then this game is for you. Even if you recuce the dialogue frequency all the way down, they still talk and make faces. Play Governor of Poker 2 online for free, or buy it on steam for 20$ if you want a real poker game.",1
"This is a very good puzzle platformer.  While playing through I felt that the creators drew inspiration heavily from Metroid and Mega Man, a feeling which is actually confirmed in-game via some background objects and animations.  The artwork in this game is gorgeous. It's Rockman platforming with Metroid atmosphere. Lots of lonely and anxious jumping with some upgrade collection in a giant maze.  The plot is unveiled mostly through static and dynamic imagery. Text is almost non-existent.  There are not many enemies to defeat. The majority of fighting is done against a few difficult bosses. There is no health, ammo, or lives to worry about and you respawn in the last room you entered so the game is very forgiving of mistakes.  Controls are a bit slippery at times and could use some tightening up but it's never frustrating. The control scheme is a bit strange on keyboard. Switching between tools mid-action requires moderate dexterity at times.  Overall I enjoyed everything and can't complain about anything.  ",1

"My favorite game of all time and a truly amazing RPG achievment by the now sadly defunct Troika Studios. Along with the first Deus Ex one of the two games you simply have to play before you die. But when being dead is this much fun, life can be somewhat over-rated. This is not Twilight with guns, it's much, much more.",1
Simply one of the best Stealth/Action games ever made,1
Where did the last hour and a half go.. Damn. This game is so simple yet so satisfying.,1
"I was pretty excited when I heard about Kyn, being a lover of nearly all things Viking/Nordic. However, when I saw the game description mention 'strategy', I put off purchasing the title because I'm fairly crappy with strategy style games. I wish the Developers would change this inaccuracy, since Kyn is simply an overhead RPG along the lines of Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin and Diablo.  There are a lot of ups and downs when it comes to Kyn. On the one hand, I want to recommend it because it's a fun title with vast, beautiful levels (maps) that are unique to one another. You'll have a great time exploring the large open areas and completing the many side quests along the way.  On the other hand, many of the exciting elements of an RPG are put on the back-burner. Such as leveling, which is usually exciting and leaves you feeling accomplished. There are only 3 attributes for you to put your skill points into each time you level up, which will only happen after you complete main missions. The entire concept of leveling within this game is mediocre. It doesn't even matter how many monsters you slay or people you help along the way.  Another down note of Kyn are the items. Most of the time when you loot a chest, you'll get a little bit of gold and some crafting items; rarely will you see any gear, let alone rare items. You'll spend quite a bit of time gathering crafting items to finally be able to make something, too. This takes the fun out of wanting to explore and open treasure chests. When the Developers boast a 'rich and deep' crafting system on the store page, I was expecting something a little more. You won't even be able to craft anything for at least the first three or four levels.  The story is also rather bland and disappointing. There's not much to say about it at all. There's also barely anything Viking/Nordic about this game except for a few references and symbols scattered here and there. Since I've listed more cons than I have pros in this review, I am going to not recommend Kyn at this point. It's a fun game, for sure, but when other games such as Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin are out there, selling at around the same market value as this game (if you're smart about purchasing), Kyn just does not have what it takes to stand out.  Edit: I have encountered a series of bugs, however minor they may be they are still quite irritating. One is the fact that the characters will get stuck on stairs repeatedly. You may not notice until you're a good way off from them. Second is that whenever you go into the menu to turn the audio down or off, it will come on again once you go back to town or load a new level.  Edit 2: More bugs and glitches found. Near the end of the game, a door becomes destroyed. Could not get one of the characters through. Also, the sound effects seem to randomly crap out and you're left with only music.   Rating:  2.5/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",-1

I loved almost everything about this game the only thing i hated was that it was only 7-8 hours long honestly the game was amazing i was not disapointed easy to start out but it scales so perfeclty into being a challenge the way they tell the story like a fairy tale in rymes and the small nariation cut scenes tied it all together to create this atmosphere that i think can not be topped in the gaming world at least not anytime soon 9.5/10,1
"Really enjoyed this game. It had a longer game play than what I normally play, but it has a great story and you get to see two different characters' lives in a world no one lives in today. It's very imaginative and makes you keep coming back for more.",1

"Currently extremely disappointed! Worst $30 I've spent for a game I currently still own on disc from original launch and know that I love to play. Within my first 2 games of online play, which is the only reason I re-purchased this game for the steep price of $30, I cannot even play. Literally. Can. Not. Play. The lag is terrible, horrible, pathetic. Freezing for 5 seconds at a time, every 20 seconds. Both games I played stalled out at locked screens forcing a resign. I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together. This is a disgrace to a game as good as this is. If this was fixed I would recommend AoM in a heartbeat, but for now, don't waste your time or money if you want to play with other people online. If I wanted to play solo I would pop in my AoM disc and be happy. But in this day and age of online gaming in the Steam multiplayer community, there is no excuse for this.",-1
One of the best rpg shooters i've ever played!  Pros: -awesome story -awesome weapons -awesome talent tree's (played only as siren) -too damn funny interactions! -awesome cutscenes  Cons: -if you dont own the dlc's you can't play Co-op online  My personal rate: 9/10,1

"First of all, yes, I haven't played this game for too much time, but as far as I can say, it's truly a special experience.  You know a game is really good when you bloody dream about aerials at night and whenever you close your eyes during the day, when you jump out of your seat when trying to dodge-hit the ball and then realise there's a barrier in between the game and reality. Also, I excpected a lot more toxicity because I'm generally bad at any game, but everybody I've played with so far was very helpful and did not get angry whenever I did truly stupid stuff.  8/8 would r8 while I sk8 again, m8",1

Hanako and Lilly, Flashbacks and Feels.  i didn't know what to expect, to be honest i thought that it would be yet another free game that you'll play to pass time or some form of grinder to play for a while to actually be able to do any damage. boy was i wrong.  it is a rather stable balance between easily won and 'oh for the love of god!', sometimes you'd feel able to win easily, sometimes you'd just feel like you're in for some trouble, and a tush handing session.  the sprites are so clean and cute, the images are amazing, though some of the effect sprites like the lasers and such do sometimes glitch and you'd see the borders of the sprite, but it's generally fogrettable.  the combat reminds me of YS: ark of napishtim, easy to play and easy to follow, i love it. the difficulty remains generally the same, level up, get better gear, get higher damage, beat enemies from 2-hits to a one hit finish, the enemies are ranging from a cannonfodder to a son of a protestant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the tactics go from one to one, to one over many, easy enough to do.  the map ranges from a wide and open fields to alleys tighter than a nun's butt, and each sector gives you a range of enemies to kill, either you completely bash them till they die one by one, or use your specials to hit with higher power or chain kills.  SPOILERS AHEAD, STORY REVIEW:  okay, it seems like a Cliche type of game at first, but it fits this game like a glove, the idea behind it is heartwarming and heartbreaking, your character is extremely determined and very resilient, the objective is great, but an old and overused cliche, though it is used correctly, but it still makes it feel a bit overused by the abundance of games that used the 'i will save Onee/Onii-chan even if it kills me'.  the Onee-chan is beautiful, sweet, kind, she'd do anything to help you, even if it kills her, what a surprise there~! though she is doing a noble thing, she has the skills, but she's not in the emotional status to partake in such journey, a place that will take your mind takes a great will, going there without preparing for external forces taking your mind over is suicide.  so, the game is free, the gameplay is spot on, the creator is not forcing you paying anything or doing so crazy crap to actually win the game, he tried his best to make a good game, and he did what's better, he created a great game.  also... Senia is Hanako, Magaleta is Lilly, Malphiq is Rin, the succubus is Shizune, the fairy is Misha~!",1
"Rise of Nations has been my 'go to' game for many years when I wanted a challenge  without a lot of story line investment. It's great to kill an hour or an afternoon, and has  so much variety that even after years of playing I know I haven't come close to doing  a quarter of the combinations available.  When the Extended Edition came out I was skeptical about spending money on a  game I already had, but it has been well worth the price. The graphics are crisper, there  is more variety in maps and nations, and it is at least as much fun as the original. So when I don't want the emotional investment of DoA, or the horror of ME3, I just sit  down and crank up my old faithful to see if I can blast the Mongols to ashes with my  nuclear warheads before they develop nuclear missille shields.  Boom.",1
Let me start by saying that the multi-player is exclusively local. That being said this game is a must own if you have a PC controller. The single player mod does offer a decent challenge but the bread and butter is in the vs. Each match is quick and exciting. The controls are simple and crisp making you feel like an expert the first time you play. The character are all mechanically identical yet are interesting in design. If you want an amazing experience when hanging out with some friends TowerFall Ascension is a good game for you.,1
"I am changing my review and giving it a thumbs up but Its still not as good as KF1 even though it has lot more content and much more polished and has amazing asthetics, I still prefer Kf1 over the new instalment in the series .",1
Amazing game that let me name my gun Mr. ♥♥♥♥ Yo' ♥♥♥♥. 10/10 would bang.,1

how can i ply this game need to waiting update or fix bug ??,-1
"The puzzles aren't overly difficult and irritating the way some are in other games, but still challenging enough. The story is rich and really interesting. It's hard to stop and take breaks because you're hungry to find out what's going on. 10/10 totally worth the money.",1
"I read all these reviews about it being very lifelike and accurate but I have yet to fly anything in this game where that's the case. I mostly enjoy the fighter jets and I can tell you the physics are just absolutely terrible. The plane will be flying sometimes almost sideways. It's just terrible. Coming from FSX, I can say that there's no way I can recommend this game over that. FSX might not be quite as detailed when it comes to like the trees and stuff but I'm in it for the flying of the plane, not the looks of the land around it.",-1
"Well, I guess its alright. I haven't played it much.",1
I would rather eat $15 of my own grubby money than feed the developers and their kids.,-1
"One of the best games I have ever played. At first glance it seems to be nothing more than a mountain simulator, but after playing for a while, you'll realise that there is more than just a mountain spinning around. Frankly the lore of this game outdoes any of the games I have ever played, the plot drives deep down into the very dephts of the human soul and spreads its reaches into the infinite vastness of the universe. Furthermore, the lore is dynamically influenced by the choices you have to make at the start and very likely you will never come across 2 of the same stories whenever you play this game.  Overall best game of the year when it comes to story telling, outshines any fromsoftware game in terms of lore depiction. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone as it can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages regardless. You can simply regard this as a game to simply run in the background and only check back every so often. OR you can examine the game deeper only to realise the breathtaking lore buried so very subtly in the game, it is truly stunning.  10/10",1
this game is really great unless you like being Germany,1
Make sure you get your permission slip signed for this FEELtrip.,1
"Fun game. You can make multi stage rockets, fast rockets and planes. Can get complex.  But I cant cuz i suck. I stick 20 rockets on a pod and fly it into the station.",1
The voice acting and story are suprisingly good.,1
"While it doesnt deliver the 'True next gen experience' as promised (it doesnt even have f*cking water splashes) its alright, i had fun",1
Pretty decent game. A bit grindy at times but something keeps making me stay for a bit.,1
"Gameplay aside... Optimization is terrible. Online services and reliability are terrible. The game can be fun when it works. I would recommend the single player for a run through, but play the multiplayer at your own risk of ruining a halfway decent experience.",-1
"IF you like to get into space adventure just Hyperspeed is not enough.Same gamplay have -Star Control 2- for example (talking to aliens, fighting them,gathering resources) but it drags you in from the first steps while -Hyperspeed- is so blank, empty.And if you want something more from this genre(type) of games try -Millennia: Altered Destinies-. ",-1
this is really good,1
"Best game ever, nothing beats SF.",1
"It's great for the lels for the first few hours, then it just boils down to monotomous gameplay. best thing to buy on sale otherwise not worth it.",-1
"Literally the worst game I have ever purchased from Steam. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t random laziness passed off as 'roguelike' because the designers couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to figure out balance. A really sad commentary on the state of game design today, and a total waste of whatever you pay for it.",-1
"This game shouldn't have been fun. End of story. It casts the player in the role of a border control inspector in a fictional, soviet-like country shortly after the end of a brutal war with its neighbors. It's almost impossible to get to the end of story mode without screwing someone over at some point, you feel like a d**k and you seriously question the government you work for and yet... it works. Having reached the majority of the 20 possible story mode endings, I still can't work out why I enjoyed 'Papers, Please' and yet I really, really did! It was probably a combination of the simple, but soul searching storyline, the addictively fun mechanics and the variety of paths through the game that give it good replayability. Nothing I can say here will truly convince you, but please try it out and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1
"Game is pretty easy to pick up for new or experienced TCG players, client is good, Auction house is fairly easy to use. This game seems like an up and comer",1
"While not as good or as original as the First Half-Life, Half-Life 2 continues the story of Gorden Freeman, following the events of Half-Life. Taking place some time in the future, Gorden must navigate his way though a drastically changed world, encountering old friends and foe's alike. Supplied with a varied array of weaponry and access to mission-critical mounts like the modified buggy, Half-Life 2 offers new challenges and hidden secrets to satisfy lovers of the series. All in all, not a bad game, but not as good as the original.",1
"Like Oregon Trail, but with zombies. Growing up in the US, many of us had elementary schools which bought Oregon Trail because it was educational. It was a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if I actually learned anything other than a lot more people died from diseases we no longer have to worry about such as cholera, typhoid fever, measles and dysentary.  I haven't really played much, but I have watched Game Grumps play this a bit. If I had to describe the genre it would be towards simulation where you have to manage resources. Combine that with the quirky humor (and pixel art) you expect from indie games.   My only complaint is that the gun controls are kind of strange. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I play with an unusual control setup so it's kind of difficult for me. So far, shooting the gun doesn't seem necessary to complete the game, but maybe on the harder difficulties will require this more.",1
Used to be a super fun game that me and my friends would spend hours on.   Making us pay a ♥♥♥♥ ton for DLC to make the game pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for base game owners was bad -   Having DLC worth more than the game and over 25 of them is even worse -  micro transactions that basically mean pay to have good weapons?  LOL payday 2. A game that lets you rob while it robs you.,-1
This game is more like an app for tablet/phone than a game for PC. If you are looking for quick achievements then this is the game for you.   For achievements: Total game play time: 4hours approx Secret Achievements: No All achievable in one playthrough.,1
"Adrift is really well optimized, the visuals and animations are looking really good, you get the 'alone in space' feeling in the game, So far i dont know what to expect story wise of the game, as i havent spoiled too much of it for my self, so its just diving in, but its high quality so far thats for sure. So if you like exploration adventure, you should get this.          YouTube™ Video:  ADR1FT Gameplay - Part 1 - Walkthrough (No Commentary)&nbsp;",1

"Great game , horrible port. fix the issues. thanks.",1
"go buy it, don't waste your time with other space sim",1
Rest in peace Texas Red,1
Most boring game i have ever played and the intro was misleading above all. Its basicly a 2d game worth 5$,-1
Love it! Its great to sit people in front of it during small parties and everyone take turns. x3,1
"After playing roughly 10 hours of this game, I can honestly say it's pretty enjoyable. There's a world of depth and complexity surrounding the myriad of races, minor factions and technologies. Even though I usually like to play 4X games, like Civ V, quick and aggressive, Endless Legend offers an incentive to progress differently by having factions that focus on varied forms of winning. Some factions have incredible bonuses to diplomacy so expansion and peace is easy for them. The Broken Lords faction have a win condition of controlling a large portion of the map and almost exclusively use the dust resource. One group actually has a motivation to be at war with as many people as possible (the quintessential strategy horde army). As a result, I'm struggling to defend myself and maintain peace throughout while building up my cities rapidly since that's what the Wild Walkers are best at. Overall, it's an interesting and challenging game that encourages different forms of play and many hours of play time to master. Definitely requires more than one playthrough.",1
"This game is my absolute favorite of all time. Borderlands 2 can be played extensively without boring you. The many characters, which each have their own unique abilities and potentially slightly effective but extremely fun specs.   What you can expect from Borderlands 2 is to be dropped into the middle of nowhere from an explosion and to be picked up by a lunatic robot. Setting you forth on a quest to become the #1 badass! This game can be really difficult and really casual at the same time. In the very first difficulty you can just wander without really having to worry about your gear, as long as you get a new gun appropriate for your level from time to time. While in the 11th difficulty, hardcore players will be satisfied, exploiting their extremely effective builds to the utmost extent. If an area is proving too challenging for you, then it's probably just time for an upgrade. it's an RPG after all, sidequesting will be necessary. The game's amazing for cooperative play as it is much more fun to experience the abundance of craziness with a pal alongside you. In any case, I recommend it for anyone who's into a game that has a pretty humorous side to it as well as bring crazy gameplay to the screen.",1
"This is such a great game! I recommend it to the fullest, though it's not idmitadly my favorite game, it hold the rank as my 4th favorite game ever! I hope others will like this game as much as i do.",1
If you want to be Big Boss  Then this game is for you!,1
Great game and series. You have the option of going stealth or run and gun. The mechanics are amazing. You can jump and climb on virtually anything. Using combinations is very rewarding.,1
"So, I'm not much of a strategy gamer myself, but something about this is really appealing and fun. I think that it has really nice pacing and being able to focus on building and exploration rather than combat is a huge plus for me. The resource management is, well, manageble even with all of these unlockable hidden resources as well. Having a mix of hostile and friendly races about is nice. Always fun knowing you have both allies and enemies and not just an overwhelming amount of either. Also, any game that lets you play space otters is good in my book.",1
  i love this game so much.,1
"yea its got puzzles and pirates. in seriousness it is always fun to play the puzzles, they are all a treat, but i never want to rank up or contunue playing",1
My playtime speaks for itself.,1
"Great game! For most people who want to play this game in 1080p (or more) I recommend going into nvidia nhancer if you've got an nvidia card of course and limiting FPS to 30 like the consoles. Variable framerates drive me nuts. Unless you have a 980gtx or higher this game will be too demanding. Also textures set on 'very high' may be too much for cards 4gb and under and cause stuttering. I am running this game on a core i-7 laptop with 32gigs of ram with two 780m gtx's in sli with a custom sli profile and I have locked 30fps performance by locking the framerate, setting everything to very high, and textures to high. Looks better and runs smoother than the xbox one version. I'm happy my aging laptop is still able to play a game like this with a locked framerate at 1080p. If people whine about performance on this game hitting that silky smooth 60ps, the 'very high' settings are basically for future hardware or very top end rigs. If you ran the game on high and turned off tessellation then you have console parity with more than likely 60fps performance for most gaming rigs. If you want pcss high rez shadows, etc..you will have to pony up the cash or wait for new hardware. I wouldn't. I wanted graphical fidelity without upgrading so I locked the framerate at 30. There is a great game if you make some smart compromises and proper tweaks.  The game feels on rails for the first hour, but then opens up and becomes a very wonderful game. I loved Tomb Raider 2013 on all platforms and liked the desperation and empathy for Lara that one made me feel. They are going for the same way here, but it doesn't hit me as hard like the first game did. Lara's more prepared and used to being bad ♥♥♥ so it doesn't feel as desperate although the game tries it's hardest to make you feel that way. Thre are lots of tombs to explore as well as a gigantic map to look for hidden items.  The game has Denuvo copy protection and I can't blame devs for using it as it really works. My only fear is not being able to online activate the game 10 years from now on future hardware. Hopefully it will be irrelevant if denuvo is defeated by then. I would like to buy the game and run it easily on any rig without online activation like the witcher 3. I feel like I really own that game and will always be able to run it on anything. I always run steam in offline mode as I am NOT a multiplayer gamer, but whenever I get online, steam updates all my denuvo games and I have to run all them at least once online to activate it AGAIN before I can play offline. So annoying. Not a fan of this copy protection if I have to prove I own the game after every single update. I want ownership, and that feeling will only come in the form of a crack however many years down the road it takes to get there. It's sad that this is the standoff we have in PC gaming these days.  With all that said: To the devs who sweat over this game and the last- Thanks guys!",1
"Grab insurgency even if you're not CS:GO fan. I've played CS:GO enough to come to the conclusion that I just don't like that game. Insurgency although uses the same engine, is very different from CS:GO and from many other FPS shooters. The graphics aren't great but they are good enough. The suppression is real, every step you take matters. Insurgency really has it's own thing going and the price is pretty darn fair.",1
The game that started it all. 10/10 would play again.,1
"While the controls are flipped for most, this MMORPG; albit scattered, is addicting to anyone's interests. Going solo or with some friends just to kick some monster tail is just part of it- after all, it is someone's story!",1
"A great action adventure game that is fresh and unparalleled. Gorgeous, charming and slick, the story is wonderfully told and the combat is varied and exciting. The enemies are varied, interesting and also vary nicely in strengths and weaknesses. It also has one of the most unique approach to difficulty I've seen, along with wonderful art and music. Not the longest of games, but will still take a good chunk of time if you do everything, the extra challenges are difficult and fun. Overall a stellar game that is well worth the price.",1
Buy This GAME! You wont regret it!,1
this game is VERY FUN (but very hard too) also if any of you stay to the the ending credits well ya its funny,1
"Reminds me of game 'Mountain' except items don't just randomly apper on the mountain in random order.  In Viridi you get random plant per week for free [as a bonus I guess for coming back] and if you can't wait you can buy plants from 9 cents &amp; up to 23 cents as I remmeber [23 or 32 but not more than 32 thats for sure]. There are 23 plants which I could find igstore and as plants grow in 'real time' you cant just replace them on daily basis and see which one is better. Its like a garden in a pot.  You need to water plants occasionaly so they dont die and if you going away for long you can activate 'Vacation' which will freeze/pause the growth of your plants so you don't need to worry about watering them until you come back.  Calm music will surely make you relax so if you want some background relaxing music then you should surely try it out.  It has steam inventory as well which is an awesoem thing to have for a collectionaire [Me]. I am not quiet sure yet of the store items which cost 3 &amp; other one for 5 euros [the only 2 items apart from plants igstore] but they seem to change the background or something more than just a plant so I will update the review when I find out.  To summorise its like a tamagochi except its at a slow pace, like realy slow one &amp; as its free I cannot put thumbs down even for micro-transactions which could be by-passed using random free plant per week.",1
One of the best horror action games.,1
"One of my fav rpg, I never beat it as a kid so i ended up playing it again on the ps3, ps vita, ps4 and now pc and I have spent well over 2000hrs playing this game &lt;3",1
this game is so sweet! ,1
"loving this game, lots of sneaking and looting with a bit of skill and weapon customization. Good ambiance and bones ad a quick way to change minor skill preferences. all in all a half decent game!",1
Master Piece.  Not Much else to say.,1
"!!!WARNING!!! There is a STRONG chance that you will experience errors the first time you launch this game!!! SOME people have solved their errors by simply unplugging their USB gamepads BEFORE launching, whereas I had to edit the game file's compatibility properties to function properly with my version of Windows, but I think it was worth it!  I absolutely LOVE this game! I am a huge fan of Ghostbusters, and this game feels (to me) like the third movie. Of course your character isn't much more than a shell for you to insert yourself into the ghostbuster team (which I think is done relatively well), but I feel as though that's the entire point. From the original actors voicing themselves, to the immersive gameplay style, and dialogue, this game had me hooked from start to finish. (even though I don't have many hours on steam just yet, I previously owned this title on PS3)   I feel as though everything done in this game is done to create as immersive an experience as possible regarding what it's like to be a ghostbuster. You catch a ghost, you get money, you destroy property, you lose money (which, in the movies, was a major gripe of customers and a realistic aspect of such an organization), the ghost fighting feels like I always imagined it would, as though you're desperately trying to grab something not of this physical world.  If you're a fan of the Ghostbusters franchise, this game is a MUST! If you're not super crazy about Ghostbusters, it's still a fun game overall, but you won't get as much out of it. Aside from the Ghostbusters aspect of it, the gameplay can get quite repetitive for some, as you WILL be doing a lot of hold beam on ghost until ghost gets tired (or destroyed), lay trap, continue holding ghost until trapped, repeat.  In the end, I feel like it more comes down to whether or not you are a fan of Ghostbusters. I'm not saying that it is a bad game in ANYWAY, BUT it WAS designed to mimic the way the Ghostbusters go about their daily business, which I feel makes up for the repetitive nature with accuracy to the source material.",1
"This game is pretty much the hit 90s cartoon program, Life with Louie. They just replaced Louie Anderson with Ron Perlman (playing himself through out the game) and being a fat kid in Wisconsin with shooting a billion cops. The reimanging holds up.  ",1

"Largely forgettable story, with a villian who is a cheap Vaas rip-off. But the zombie killing is fun, particularily with the freedom of movement the parkour system allows.  The one significant problem the game had when I played it was that there was no firearms other than lvl 1 firearms which could spawn (due to a glitch in a lookup table or something like that). Dont know if they have fixed it, but it meant you HAD to melee.",1

"Protip: the pistol is in the box where the first enemy is.  If i had to compare the gameplay to somthing it would probably be leaning towards Resident Evil 1. You have to use 'Disks' to save your game, no auto or quick save here. You have to pick your kills, or risk losing all your ammo, andthere is some inventory management to work with. There are also alot of secrets in this game, so keep your eyes peeled.  Not much to find in terms of story here, its all strict careful planning, Learning how to do every room, and finding out where all the guns and pickups are.

"I played this game for about 2hrs. That is pretty much where the novelty wears off. This game made its name on the idea of killing civilians and the violence of it, but in the end, its not even that bad. After 10 minutes, you will have seen all 12 types of executions (that you need to perform to get health back... weird but it is what it is.)  There is no plot, no story. Just an angry character that wants to kill everyone... Kinda of a missed opportunity imo. There is no emotional attachement to anything in this game.   What kills this game's 'fun' is that gameplay is flawed to start with. Your character gets stuck on anything, even by adjusting gamma, the game is so dark, you can't see anything without pressing ALT to highlight thinks that need to be picked up of killed, cops or civilians shoot at you from beyond the screen's edge, and it's impossible to know from where you are being shot at.   There is no strategy to this game at all.  Nothing you do in this game you haven't done in GTA a thousand times. Nothing to see here.",-1

"As someone who really enjoyed NFS Underground 2, this game felt very reminiscent, the story is good enough to at least keep playing through the campaign and the cars handle great as long as you put the time in to level them up. The map is awesome, it spans something like 110 kilometers across from Seattle to Miami and a lot of places in between, it's a lot of fun to cruise across the country with friends just exploring. The only downside is that this game is pretty pricy when you include Wild Run. Definitely check this game out when it goes on sale if you enjoy racing games that are more casual than Forza.",1

"Amazing completely amazing i love this game and its so challenging and amazing and i need to make my vocabulary better... cool, its cool.",1
"It's kind of a CoC type of game whereas you don't expect to sit and do everything then and there. You come back each day as you progress, but it a little more consistent I guess. It's addicting to say the least. I just leave the game running while I work so I can catch the bonuses and level up when I need to. It puts you in the place of Nick Fury if he were in a fantasy game world. 'I'm putting together a team...' and in addition you train them and train them. Addicting!",1
"awesome game, worth every penny :D",1
"~You test the chocolates on the chicken. Chicken dies. Then again you don't know if it's because the chocolates were poisoned or from the fact that you fed it chocolates. You decide to find someone unimportant to test the chocolates for poison later.~  I guess the proper way to start this review is to mention that this game is amazing. You get to choose activities for a soon to be queen - the subjects she's going to educate herself with. You get to choose two subjects a day and the amount of points gained in them is affected by her mood. Over the 40 days you have left to your coronation you're going to face certain events - many of them resulting from the choices you've made.   How does the system work? For example, you decide to let Julianna stay, and she helps you learn Lumen magic. You get several occassions to blast your enemies away with your newly aqcuired power or... you fail to contain it/your power is too weak if the stats aren't high enough.  You could also choose to follow the peaceful path, or perhaps become a musician with no intent to fight anybody. There's tons to choose from, numerous ending possibilities and parts where your enemies try to get you assassinated.   Another part of the game is different outfits you earn by raising corresponding stats, that add bonuses to the whole skill tree. You can only equip them at a certain point of the day and they can provide an extra modification to some skill check outcomes (for example you'd like to fail a certain check and don't want to raise the skill too far, but pass a different check for it).  Long Live The Queen is a game filled with humor and an overwhelming amount of choices that affect the whole story line. If you're after a fun game with a great replayablility factor, this is a title for you. I highly recommend it.",1
"It's f***ing Half-Life, dude. 'nuff said!  10^10/10",1
something spooked me so i closed the game. who wins now ,-1
Excellent demo of whats to come. I've visited most of the museums which the art in this demo provides. It does a great job recreating them and letting you comprehend the size and emotion behind the art. Definitely worth a try.,1
The game was good before patch 3... It made the game less fun and more laggy for me.,-1
"I only got this game in the first place, because my friends like simulator games, and they like multi-player games. So... One of them gifted me it. All I can say is .. PURE AWESOME! Not only because you get to fullfill your fantasies as a bank robber, you also do that with friends to share the experience. That is all.",1

"Smashy and fun. Even with only partial controller support, gameplay was smooth. Found a bug whilst piecing together the Armageddon Blade, but nothing game-breaking.  I originally started this on console when it was originally released; it's good to see the gameplay and graphics still hold up.",1
"A fragfest of the western variety, fun to play occasionally, a jamboree when played with friends. The trailer shows it all, kicking shooting and excessive drinking of whiskey.",1

"I've eyed this game for a while as I've seen it on sale once or twice, but finally decided to give it a go when I felt the price was right. Felt like it was worth the purchase, but even so, it bugs me that there is no one online to play with after beating a mid-ranged story mode.  Coffin Dodgers feels like Mario Kart met up with Road Redemption while introducing it all with an interesting story line to say the least. The game is good, but it feels like it could have been a lot better with a few tweaks. Death one day decides to show up to the little town where there are numerous old folks. One by one, they will be taken away if they do not succeed in placing first in the race.   The game itself is enjoyable. In fact, the game feels quite right as no shortcuts or glitches seem to prop up. When I first started playing, the driving scheme didn't sit too well. It felt like Mario Kart turning initially but ended up as Sonic All Star Racing drift feel. I was slightly confused in knowing how much was too much going into a turn when it came to smashing the gas. After a bit of time, I familiarized myself with their control scheme and actually find it enjoyable. You can get through a track without using the brake by letting off on the gas to make sharp turns. There are times you will need to quickly let go, tap the brake, and hit the gas quickly to keep your head out in first. The carts you drive in themselves were also up for question before I bought this game. I figured how fast could one really go and make a scooter fun to drive. They, however, made it so. Besides the driving feeling right, they added power-ups within the game. Upgrading your scooter can allow you to hold two power-ups simultaneously as well change it's color and engine specification.   Power-ups come in many forms such as rockets, boosters, mac-10 automated pistol, and even oil slicks. My power of choice in this game is the ability to whack your opponents with your cane at any given moment. This is one of the great features in this game that many other games as Mario Kart lacks. I like games that consistently keep you on your toes, engaged, and force you to pay attention at all times. At any point of a race, you are able to charge up how hard you want to hit someone and are able to release that charge right through your cane into another racers face. Just because you don't have a power-up, doesn't mean you won't get knocked off your scooter/kart. In this sense, it follows Road Redemption but adds the extra umph once a power-up is picked up. This feature alone can make it worth while, and as seen in RR, can make the whole game. After each race, you are rewarded with coins and experience. There was an excellent balance between grinding for cash and earning rewards. Throughout the race, there may be random obstacles within the way or ways to get more XP or coins. A cop car or a regular car may come driving through, a pedestrian may be crossing, or zombies might be in the way. I also have to give the game huge props for doing multi/local player battle race extremely enjoyable and simple to access.  Graphics are absolutely appropriate for what they did. It feels like N64 graphics but with a 2015 update/mod/patch/fix to it. I love the sounds and the ambiance provided within the game. You will see your old timer as they are cruising through the map looking around and observing what's going on. It's small details like this that make games noticeable (but it's the big details like game play that make up a game)!  Though albeit the game for the most part is good, it could have been a lot better. Besides having one melee attack, why not add two? Or a variation to the swing? Small things like this take the game from simply having an ability, to extending the power of this ability that effects the entire game. It also gives me a different method of attack. I would have also liked to see different game modes. Sumo, battle, or maybe a mode to see who could blow up or whack the most zombies.  Because it is missing a little, but because it does have local, I think it's a well rounded score deserving a   Indie RATING : 7.8/10  Standalone RATING : 7.0/10  I would highly recommend playing this with friends as it's difficult to find people online. Also, for any future updates or DLC's to the game I would recommend a longer storyline with a bit more whackyness to the tracks. Towards the end (and especially the final track), things finally got overly creative that it was starting to become really fun to play. Playing a bit of local co-op I've noticed some players spend a lot of time on the floor. I noticed myself on story mode that I'd be licking pavement. I would make it slightly more of a challenge to knock someone off their scooter.

Very enjoyable game.   Upsides - Great enjoyable fun game. Some very nice graphical effects and transitions that are oh so missing from modern games. Nice sound effects and decent voice overs.  Downsides -  Rather short . Gets to easy nearer the end. Only a handfull of weapons.,1
"Not the best shooter I've ever played but well worth the 9,99euro Big sandbox you can roam, a few good fights and nice zoomable guns. Not as good as Shadow of Chernobil, but if you've played that it is cool to play a different game in the same world",1
"Just walking in this game causes you to feel nauseous. Terrible graphics, enemies kill you almost instantly, ♥♥♥♥-poor effort with interaction...everything about this game is a fail.",-1
Very unique and very fun game. The puzzles get harder and harder as the game progresses. The Swapper isn't very long - took me about 6-7 hours to finish on my first play through and I like to explore everything - but it is definitely something I enjoyed playing for every one of those hours. Highly recommended.,1
"Awesome game Mexican themed.   CO-OP is awesome, great moves and fighting. Lots of good humor and the looks and gameplay are great!",1
"Look you get boobs, you get ♥♥♥♥♥, what more do you want? But really if your not into this kind of thing don't get it if you are the girls are well drawn and the story is alright (better before remasterd though).",1
"An absolutely phenomenal game. The puzzles are well thought out and the animations of the young boy are beautifully portrayed. But the high point of the game is the atmosphere it sets up. The dark colors, moving shadows, and amazing sound effects really plunge you into the world of limbo. Riddled with metaphor and mystery this game will surely keep you thinking long after you've played it.",1
No FOV slider. Default FOV must be 60.  If I can't find a workaround this game is unplayable to me.,-1
"You wake up with no idea of where you are or how you got there. Eerie looking mechanical parts with what seems to be biomechanical growths conjoining them sprout from the walls of the facility. Every sound makes you uncomfortable. The environment itself is a macabre display of fleshy machines. Welcome Frictional Games' newest horror title, SOMA.  SOMA, unlike many horror games, is not about jump scares. It is about terror and unease. The atmosphere is designed to make you feel extremely uncomfortable. To progress in the game's story you are forced to do things that make you feel instant regret.  On the subject of atmosphere, the sound design is some of the best I have ever experienced. It does an excellent job setting the tone and every bit of the environment including drips from the ceiling have an associated sound effect to really immerse you in what you are experiencing.  The storytelling is also something that would be worth mentioning. It's exceptional, not just among other titles in the same genre, but compared to almost any other game out there. The narrative the game tells really tests the player's humanity. You are forced to do things that make you question your own choices. You encounter several robots who are completely convinced they are human. It is all very unnerving. I have noticed a number of complaints with the voice acting breaking immersion, but I have found most of it so far to be good enough that it didn't really affect my own game experience.  The last thing to consider would be the interactivity of it all. There are several hundreds of pointless objects that you can interact with, carry, throw or even just rotate around to look at. Since the visuals are so stunningly high res, it really adds to the experience. The first scene in the game comes to mind where you are looking for something you have to drink before your brain scan, but as a player you probably got sidetracked and instead trashed your apartment by flinging every interactable object across the room.  My overall opinion of SOMA is that you need to buy this game. The sound and visuals rival that of AAA titles and the price is extremely reasonable. I enjoy it so much that I can't wait to get home and play it some more.  10/10 Would think I am a robot again.",1
Terraria is a very fun indie game that will never get boring. you will never want to get off untill your parents tell you to get off,1
"It's ridiculous how Infinity Ward managed to regurtitate the same franchise over and over, gain success, but suddenly crashes and burns. This is exactly how Call of Duty: Ghosts feels like - a bigger slap than what Modern Warfare 2 is to Call of Duty 4.  Single player offers the exact, same plot as the previous titles did (don't get fooled by the 'underdog' title), with just a little mix and matching between Modern Warfare/Black Ops titles. And you father in-game dies in the most cliched way possible. I mean, you simply haven't been presented with a way to connect with the guy, other than calling him 'dad' (just kidding, you're *surprise!* mute). No character depth whatsoever. Even the main villian is straight out of recent hollywood flicks - disgruntled former military person gets left behind and holds a grudge? Please.   Expect guns, goons and gratuitous explosions, but it just feels like the same CoD experience you had in the last 6 years. But you get to control a dog. Is that a good point? Frankly, no, since it's the same 'go-to-this-checkpoint-while-we-the-developers-make-sure-you-don't-get-spotted-at-all' kind of thing.   Ooh, and SPACE! You get to have firefights in space. Which is a little cool, if it's not frustratingly hard to find and pop out of cover due to your altered acceleration/deceleration. But you're in space. So I'll let it slide.  Multiplayer is an even bigger letdown, with massive latency issues and ill frame rates. Not to mention the maps, that are seemingly carbon copies of the map Downturn in MW3. It sucked not only in visuals, but also in map layout - it's like they're expecting everyone to either camp or run as a Maniac. Every map in Ghosts is like that, I swear. 'Dynamic' maps are supposed to break that habit, but considering that's only one map (a pre-order bonus, at that), you'd think they should've done a good job. Except they didn't. Because it's not dynamic, it's just a heavily-scripted, moving-platforms version of (yes) Downturn!  Overall, kudos to the space concept (a nice surprise, actually), but the rest just falls down hard. I regret pre-ordering this on retail, and I guess, I'm just lucky to have bought the Standard edition.  YES * High production value on set-pieces (especially the space parts) * Great graphics  NO * Single-player campaign drags on * Utter reliance on set-pieces instead of great gameplay * Crappy support for low-end systems * Multiplayer maps are terribad * You'll lag hard on multiplayer  Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED",-1
"I strongly recommend this game for the lovecraft fans, unlike other horror/adventure games I've played the suspense doesn't leave after the first encounter. You have to become increasingly creative to hide from the enemy. The lack of light and general ambience of the game is pretty chilling, with the added real life darkness and headphone combo this game is super effective at letting the player become immersed in the game.",1
"It says it's Vive compatible, but every time it launches, it says 'not compatible with your active headset'. It's also not fully compatible with the Vive controllers. Vive's input system is often still recognized by the PC as a mouse, but it behaves oddly if you don't have a mouse hooked up (why hook up a mouse if I'm really just using my VR PC for VR, right?) It's also really annoying having to use a physical keyboard to enable VR videos. They do know that you can't see any keyboard while using VR, right?  Also, you would think it would be possible to create a VR desktop environment in which you have more space than on any screen you have connected to the PC, but for some reason that's not possible with existing software.  This software needs some rather large updates before it functions the way it's supposed to.",-1

Terraria the original sandbox that is still updating till this vey day. With its calming grass biome music to the wildness of the underworld down below this game is going strong with the recent update it has made an entire New game Style Adventure maps to the people that dont wanna play a the normal terraria people can do these fun maps made not by the developers but by the Players that spend hours making beautifal maps that stun alot of people from these maps. with another update coming back this game can step even further.,1

"Honestly I want to enjoy War Thunder and I originally did. As I've progressed through the game I've had good moments and bad. Having recently unlocked the Leopard 1 I thought I'd give War Thunder more of a go than I had been. The moment that War Thunder becomes a failure is fairly prominent, especially in the last update 1.59. And that is the ATGM(Anti-tank Guided Missiles). Having played through the Tiger II and all that before ATGMs were introduced I wasn't too alarmed or really fearful of them. Having played a few round through my Leopard, however, I find that ATGMs are way too imbalanced for the current way WT plays and handles. The most prominent issue is the IT-1. An atgm built on the chasis of a T-62, with an armor thickness of up to 500 mm in the turret due to its slope and the fact that the turret is the height of a child's palm means that these things can sit behind a hill without exposing its body and one-shot any tank it comes across without having to worry about return fire. Now I know that these rockets are incredibly hard to control, but this doesn't excuse the fact that these things are nigh impossible to kill on certain maps with the right experience. I don't want to call 'russian bias' but seriously come on. These things are starting to pop up in droves in high tier games and honestly the only fun I had in WT was GF and now with ATGMs being everywhere I find it incredibly hard to enjoy.  All in all I don't recommend this game unless you're only in it for Air Battles with friends or low tier ground forces.",-1
"Just finished the game and WOW what a ride!  Not only is the story and characters great, particularly for a zombie game, but the combat and parkour are heaps of fun.  A huge thank you goes to the devs from me on this. It was so very nice to pick up a new AAA title that had a lot of hype and play it for the first time, being able to experience everything in the glory that it was made to be. None of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of having to play with settings or mess with files to try and tweak things to get the frame rates etc right. This game worked.  No bugs. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It worked.  So thank you devs, in this day and age such a small thing (of actually completing a game before it hits shelves and not selling half finished garbage), doesn't go unnoticed.  I have, I will and I do recommend anyone interested in something enjoyable, full of side missions, some great combat and progression system to buy this. Give it a go.",1
"This is definitly my most favorite game ever.  I have never played any of the other MGS games but I really want to give them a try. The story in this game sucks ♥♥♥, its like watching some dumb anime, and even after finishing the game i still have almost no idea what the story is talking about.  It took me 100hours to finish all the main mission, and its probably the most fun i have ever had. the main mission dont take that long to complete ofcourse but I love just running around super fast and shooting people in the face to make them sleep. also blowing someone's face with a rifle in this game is satisfying as ♥♥♥♥.  In my opinion there is no game better then this one and I think others will agree.   Plus you can attract people with anime posters you find at your base its a masterpiece",1
"best thing about this game is that there's an item that allows you to choose a foto of something and burn it, so if you think someone is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ you can burn them",1

"Speaking as an avid fighting game fan, I can safely say that this is without a shadow of a doubt that this game is something that comes only once in a lifetime. Everything about Skullgirls as a whole is absolutely remarkable, from the Dark Deco design of the characters - something that has been in use since Batman: The Animated Series but my only gripe is that the roster feels relatively small in comparison to other fighters out there - the swinging soundtrack, to the relatively tight and simple controls. If you were to ask me, however, I feel as though that this title should've been brought out years ago in arcades all across the globe.  I have spoken about this game numerous times in the past, plus you've also might have heard so many other people sing the praises of this game that it so rightly deserves, so I'll just cut right to the chase. At the asking price of only 15 bucks, it feels relatively cheap for a game that has this much lasting charm, quality. pedigree and challenge, but at the end of the day, it's more than fair. Sure, you might need to shell out some extra cash for the extra stuff, but at five bucks individually, but it's worth it.  All in all, this is one fighting game that deserves its spot if not stand head and shoulders with its competitors. If this isn't in your collection, then I don't really think you should classify yourself as a gamer unless if you've given this one a fair chance. Sure, the story mode isn't anything to write home about, but considering the rather grim nature of each character's backstories, some of them end in a rather goofball way (or not, depending on who you choose). And although this game feels really simple, the amount of information this gives you like Air Cancels, Ensemble Attacks, Off-The-Ground combos and so much more, this game has the most detail that you'll ever see in this game's tutorial mode. Where else are you gonna see that?  I could sit here and just continue to harp about this all night and tell you more, but this is something that you have to see for yourself. You owe it to yourself for this wonderful experience.",1
"It's one of the best Call of Duty's out there. The Campaign is great, yet the multiplayer has a small population and is full of hackers. I reccomend that you buy this on game when it's on sale and focus on playing the campaign since the multiplayer is not as good as it used to be.",1
A very awesome &amp; challenging game.,1
"well, ill say this, it was a good game, it WAS. now it lags so bad i have a hard time moving and going places and killing things. i know its not my computer and i know its not my internet, so ill just leave it at that. there are so many builds and it is still kinda confusing to me as well, cuz so many people say its not a gear dependant build, but eventually, they are all geardependant. i dont think there is any build out there, you can go and fight and kill things(and win in the higher levels) in just a pair of boxers.",-1

Ok, this was my first TTG , but since i just heard good stuff about The Wolf among Us and WD, and since i am a great Fan of this series, Novel AND TV, i just had to buy this.    And i don't regret a second of it.  The Graphics are neat, fitting for the setting, and a HUGE bonus is , that they got the Original Actors for the Voices.  The Story itself...well, i can't say too much without a spoiler, but it sure as hell is worth the name of the game.  To everyone, who loves GoT and/or SoF&amp;I, i strongly revcommend this game, since it'S a huge addtion to the Series in general.",1
Crappy version of Minecraft? It wasn't too bad as long as you get a group of friends together and goof off in survival. Worth the $2-3 I paid for it though,1
A top contender for best sandbox game out there and a lot more fun with friends. I've never said no to a friend asking me to play this game with them and always had a blast doing so.,1
"Entertaining for the first couple sequences, until you realize the game improvements only improve how the game looks, not how it plays. Gameplay is rough and unsatisfying, as it becomes a bad Zelda clone spliced with a really basic JRPG battle menu.",-1
"The game itself is quite fun, phisics, gameplay and graphic are pretty decent, but it has two main flaws:  1)AI: your opponents are completly stupid and unware of others on track; result: every race becomes a destruction derby after 1 lap 2)main carreer design: you basically earn too much money, that you will spend on upgrades for your vehicle  those two flaws combined make the game waaay too easy. it's a shame because it can be a very fun and challenging game with only minor refinments.  I can recommend it only on discount as a 5-minutes waster",1
The best feature was the uninstal option.,-1
a bit on the grindy side but for a free game well done to the devs,1
"Fun and a Great game overall. Recommended for those people who play Basketball for fun and not seriously. Fast gameplay, Decent Graphics but the Community is really bad.

"One of my favorite games on steam. It's combat is similar to that of Diablo. Your methods of attack are of course Ranged (Guns) and Melee (Swords). The skill tree system allows you to specialize in one or the other but also allows you to mix and match to find a style that find a style that fits your method of playing. The game is pretty long with plenty of side quests and the story is pretty good. The dialog could be better for other characters but the conversations between you and your partner are quite humorous. There isn't any grinding in this game so the game pretty much encourages you to do side quests to make sure that you're at the appropriate level so things aren't to hard. There is some strategy involved in combat so you can't just go rushing into a fight expecting to win all the time. I learned that the hard way. You're ghostly companion can also be leveled up and the game allows you to spend her stat points as you please, so you can make her a tank or an all out brawler. She also has two modes of attack: Melee and Ranged which you can switch at anytime you want even in the midst of combat. She has plenty of buffs you can choose from when you level her up, giving you more defense, attack, etc. The games multiplayer isn't that bad but it's kind of dead so maybe you might want to try and get a friend to play with you. Overall the game is worth the buy even at full price. My personal score for the game is an 8/10 so give it a try!",1
This game changed my life. I never knew video games could be like this. I am now complete!,1
Yes I rate this game as a yes because Dark Souls 3 is fun wait a min why would you be continueing to scroll down for better review take my word and JUST BUY THE GAME,1
"I refunded it thinking that it was gonna be rubish  After the sale is off I realised that i was sooo wrong. The gameplay people posted on youtube, the amazing cities I've seen makes me soo sad and regret I refunded it. Pls give me another chance and have another sale.",1
"Despite there only being 5 campaigns (plus The Sacrifice), the game is certainly replayable. It's not too difficult to play either, and very well balanced.",1
Brother showed me this and its a great game!,1
"This game really grabbed me. It's theme is tight, art is spot on, fun, and fitting. Everything makes sense, and to say it is fair and balanced is incorrect; the title gives an idea of the difficulty. It's not a statement, it's a warning, a taunt, and the game is rooting for you to die and start again. And if you have some patience you will. Again and again. My suggestion is to jump in and play a game. You will most likely die by the first time the hounds come for you. Then, unless you are a purist, go find the dont starve wiki if you want the whole system, and if you want more of a guide, find a walkthrough on the Steam forums or the wiki.   Don't Start nailed it. Uncompromising but not without warning. There is no hand holding within the game. And it's up to you to survive. Don't starve.",1
"Turbo Dismount; multiple things really. A sandbox? A crashing simulator? Kill Bieber simulator? A combination of all that actually. This is a game I can keep coming back to, pick up and play, and just have good old fun. Turbo Dismount isn't perfect however. I'll go over that later. I've owned this game since it came to early access, which it is currently  OUT  of. Here's a little list of things I like and don't like    Maps[/u]  The official maps are well made. You can play the game with just the original levels and have fun for hours, but then theres workshop maps. You can make your own level which is pretty simple to do. You just need to download Unity. If you are new to Unity, don't worry the Unity website has plenty of tutorials. So far I've made about 10. They aren't hard to make, but if you are making a big level, then yes it will be time consuming and long. Theres around 300 workshop maps. Most are decent, some are just random things put down, or an editing level scene, or something just.. abnormal. You won't run out of maps to play though.    Vehicles[/u]  There are a number of vehicles, you cannot however make your own. Theres a whole bunch, all with different poses (at least 4 on each vehicle) so theres plenty to look at. Since the game came out of early access though vehicle updates, or updates in general have been scarce. But don't blame them, this is a complete game, not a beta or alpha.    Charaters[/u]  Hello, and welcome to the forgotten part of the game. Don't understand what I mean? There are only two charater choices. Look at other dismount games, with lots of charaters. But only two is just terrible. The devs just didn't add any, only Mr. and Mrs. Dismount. No different body types.  BUT  there are bobbleheads! Basically get a face of anyone from Nicholas Cage to yourself and slap it on your charater! It makes it more interesting, seeing someones face get blown off by speeding cars. But still, charaters are not great.    A Bit More[/u]  Yes, I do recommend this game. One of my favorite games in my steam library. There are a few bugs, some of which are gamebreaking. But in my honest opinion, Turbo Dismount should of had more done to it during Early Access. Lots of missing features that could make this game so much better! Workshop for vehicles, Saving Replays, more level creation assets, and more of everything in general. From obstacles to poses. But, you know what. I got 65~ hours from this game. Maybe you will and enjoy it. Turbo Dismount is a great game for anyone really. $9.99 to have fun with crashing cars and exploding celebarties!    ",1
excellent Strategy FPS!!!! Remember.... dont go alone! Attack with the team!,1
"&lt;Rant&gt;  I am not going to lie I am not going to exaggerate This is the Greatest game I have ever played.  I have always loved MMORPGs. I have played WoW, archeage and a few others, whilst they all had good points  and bad points this game has EVERYTHING.   Pros:  Interesting NPCs, all fully voiced with FEELING. The voice actors don't feel bored  *cough* Peter the boring ghost out of destiny *cough*  Skill system makes leveling up more than just a *ding*- I have spent more time than I like to admit  just thinking over what  to put my next point into. *NOTE: be careful, once you put a point in, it costs a lot of gold to get it out apparently  The worlds HUGE!  Well duh Lewis its an elder scrolls game what did you think it would be? No voice in my head,  I mean more than that- skyrim, morrowind, daggerfall, they felt empty, this game has quests,  things to find, items to pick up, runes to collect (more on that later) and much, much more at every turn   This ones more hards to explain. You know that feeling when in Skyrim you heard the theme and you felt epic? When I'm riding down the road on my horse listening to the music, (for more on my horse see cons) that feeling  occurs, RIDING BETWEEN TOWNS FEELS EPIC a.k.a exactly what a game like this should do  Music is awesome and meaningful without breaking emersion  *Sigh* Its time for...  Cons:  £70 for the 'real' version??? I bought imperial addition because of two things: 'Horses are apparently super expensive' and well since theres only one dlc for the game I may as well. It is worth it, especially if you plan on playing with friends due to the 'scrolls of mara' which gives you a 10% exp bonus and has a hilarious animation that left me and my friend in stitches (SPOILER ALERT: sparkles come out your bum as you essentially marry them). Anyways back to my original point... There is nearly £30s MORE dlc in this game AFTER the imperial addition. I'll be honest I don't really mind that. I wouldn't mind if there was £50 more dlc that adds content into the game but instead the crown store (which is generally not to pay to win) allows you to buy the 'adventure's pack'. This pack allows you to be ANY RACE in ANY alliance. Forcing my friends to be either a Redguard, Orc or Brenton was horrible, my friend bought the game so he could play with me, his words: 'I can't wair to be a kajit like I was in skyrim', being the understanding fellow he is he picked Orc without a fuss-  RACE BOUND PAY WALLS SUCK!  Also optional subscription which gives you DLC for free, cosmetic items and 10% bonus to everything, theres literally a list of which includes EXP, research times, wiping your ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing your mum, etc, etc. Ok, I'll be honest this games way of keeping the game supported is actually the best system out there with possible the exception of Wow except this game has no sub! :D Not pay to win at all, mostly cosmetic with a few 'get there faster' style thing (e.g. pay £5 to do this, this or this or spend a few hours doing quests).  To sum up my first con, Money system GOOD not crap like certain other games that come to mind *cough* archeage *cough*  Graphics are ok on ultra if you can run it, one of the best for an MMO. Graphics good enough for things to look cool, not good enough for me to cry whilst looking directly at it.  Now this one bugs me the most: random frame drops after playing for a while.  PRO TIP: Use the 64 bit version of the game, in files it's called ESO64.exe more or less solved the problem however only use this method if your PC has more than 4GBs of RAM. I'm not gonna start explaining 32 bit vs 64 bit so google it :P   In Conclusion Or TL;DR: BUY THE GAME AND YOU WILL BECOME ADDICTED FASTER THAN YOU CAN FUS RO DAH... but only get it in the sales when its 50% off like it did ;)  Time to go play more ESO... &lt;/Rant&gt;",1

I cannot wait to get my first driver working for me.. untill then long hauls and lots of coffee.   2 states with a third coming. The rest will be payed DLC i believe. It is a bit small but by the time they get to the heartland I will have a trucking empire. You only get 2 trucks for now but there are already mods out there and many more will be coming. I won my copy of ATS watching geekdomo on twitch Great streamer who usually streams a variety of games but has been playing sim games lately.,1
"Note from the Start, I will be editing this review WITHOUT spoilers as the game continues to expand chapter by chapter.  Season Two takes off where Season One left off, at least not too far ahead, but enough to progress the storyline. This time though- you take control as the one everyone loved, Clementine. You can tell she's aged a bit (but I won't tell you how much!)  Many a things happen in the first episode- which is exactly what should happen- along with a huge amount of people to meet. Most of the Characters are forgettable- at least name wise, it might be me but I simply cannot remember many of these characters by name- and I am recalling this from playing the episode yesterday. Clementine has went through a TON of character development- you will be able to tell about twenty or thirty minutes in that she is no longer who she once was because of everyone she loves dying around her. Even throughout the first episode you will see her change over and over (I again, won't say how, but it is impressive!)  Overall, I have no qualms or satisfaction issues, I enjoyed it all and love/hate getting teased by the cliffhanger!  I would give this game a 9/10 and would easily recommend to all I know interested in the zombie franchise era :)  Truly,   TwR",1
"Styled very much like a classic arena FPS, except it's you versus all sorts of spikey, explodey, shooty contraptions, not other players or AI bots. The game moves fast and smooth, a necessity for this style of run-and-shoot twitch shooter, and plays equally well with KB+M or controller. Love the cel shaded artwork and the weird 'alien factory' type design of the game world. There's also a good sense of humor that is thankfully never overdone. I had no idea what to expect in this one and it has turned out to be one of my favorite 2014 games to date, a half hour at a time adrenalin rush that I've kept installed on all my computers since the game was released.",1
"Usually to lazy to write reviews of games, this one deserves it. Everything in this game is executed perfectly during the whole expericnce there is not one thing I would want to change.   Game play 10/10 Visuals 10/10  Story 10/10   Would spend £600 on graphics card again!!",1
"Offworld is a unique RTS game that captures the best and worst parts of capitalism, in space! I've been following this game for some time, and I am not disappointed by the results of the hard work of the development team.  The overall objective of the game is to become the most profitable off-world trading company by becoming the most profitable and efficient corporation around. You'll achieve this by building supply chains of goods, selling them to a local colony, shipping them off the planet, and using your gains to buyout your competitors while avoiding being bought out yourself.  Positives: +Amazing soundtrack by Christopher Tin (composer of Baba Yetu, of Civ 4 fame) +Quick cutthroat gameplay; the decisions on where to land, and what to start producing are the beginnign of a race to quickly provide goods that meet the demands of a local colony. +The gameplay is unique: there isn't any 'militay' component to this game; instead you will be competing with other corporations in the marketplace to become the most efficient and profitable offworld-trading company. +Interesting hostile actions - while you can play it straight and just compete on the 'free market', there are a variety of options to sabatoge your competitors through illicit means. +Unique factions - each faction has their own set of strengths, and weaknesses; playing one versus another feels very interesting and different. +Great writing (in the tutorial and opening missions, at any rate).  Negatives: -It seems like there's not really a comeback mechanic once you start to fall behind; if you make a few mistakes early, you're probably going to have a bad time. I could be wrong, but once I start to lose, I continue to lose. -The factions aren't visually all that different. -This game is probably overpriced for the content that you're getting; I recommend purchasing this game on at least a 25% sale, probably closer to 50%. -I'm unsure about the replayability of the game; so far, the experience has been novel; outside of multiplayer, I don't think the game will provide more than 20 horus of gameplay.  Overall, I highly recommend this game for RTS players who want a different experience - namely one that focuses on competitive supply chains and economic efficiency. The game has a lot of character, and has been very enjoyable to explore.",1
"  This game has a deep sense to it. It blurs out the main theme by making you look for your sister, but in the end - that's not the main thing. It's almost anticlimactic.",1
Fun if you like shooters and RPGs. Much better than Fallout 3.,1

"Another excellent adventure from Wadjet! Can't say that I loved this one as much as Technobabylon from a story or puzzle perspective, but the production overall is top-notch. Highly recommended.",1
"I'm pretty sure no one expected Hatoful Boyfriend to be as good as it is (me included), but given what the original Hatoful Boyfriend did; how could one expect the sequel to end up?  Unfortunately, not much. Since the previous game had wrapped up just about everybirdie's character arc, there wasn't much room for expansion in the characters. Holiday Star abandons the 'pigeon dating simulator' thing for a more linear story. That's not to say it's bad, in fact it reduces the redundant dialogue from replaying the game. But with the branching story gone, it's hard not to feel something was taken.  Sadly, if you've already played the previous game Holiday Star doesn't give you that morbid curiousity that makes you say 'this is a weird dating sim'; since the previous game perfectly elaborated the backstory. And without that sense of curiousity, Holiday Star just isn't as mind-blowing as the first game.  While Holiday Star's writing isn't as good as the previous game's, it does make it up with the story. Since Holiday Star has almost no pretenses of being a 'pigeon dating simulator', the story focuses less on the character and instead on your bizarre adventures in St. Pigeonations. What Holiday Star has a hard time doing compared to the previous game is to subvert expectations, since the first game blew it's load on that department; there wasn't much Holiday Star could do in that regard.  Also, Holiday Star has the nasty habit of giving you a choice that actually could give you a bad ending and makes you restart the game. This would be fine if Holiday Star was closer to a dating sim, but given the linearity of the game it's easy to forget to save and end up repeating an entire episode. My best advice here is to save if a choice pops up.  Holiday Star is accessible without playing the previous game, but it's still highly recommended that you play the previous game first; just so you'd already be emotionally invested in the characters.   Holiday Star perfectly supplements the previous game's story, but unfortunately that's as much as I can say about it. Think of Holiday Star as a doujin/fanfic that adds the story of the previous game, but without the joy of it being as new as the original.",1

"An amazing game!!! Great game-play, never seen such detail in an aviation game!!!",1
"I enjoy strategy games, but there was something about the total war series that didn't feel right. This game made me realize how much more fun it is to be able to control an army while also acting as an individual unit and being able to fight as well. The game has a lot to offer and while the graphics are dull and the gameplay can get a little bit repetitive, the active modding community does a lot to fix that and make this game a must buy.",1
"This game sucks. After i install the game and want to test and play, i log into the beginner server and when it finish loading suddenly i was kicked out with the suspicion of cheating. Wtf... is this how u guys treat a new player? kick him out from playing the game? bad bad bad bad bad.",-1
One of the best singleplayer FPS games in the last few years.,1
"I gave 'Why Am I Dead At Sea' every opportunity to disappoint me. The character sprites felt derivative of a certain console RPG franchise depicted in my profile pic; the chiptune soundtrack suggested a by-the-numbers approach to game design. I am relieved to report that these initial doubts fell by the wayside after only a little play, and surface concerns of this sort disappeared once I submerged myself in the mystery.  The central conceit is that you're the spirit of someone recently killed, and you can inhabit the bodies of people you know to access their abilities and research the circumstances of your death. If you learn enough about your host, you can take full control, doing things that they wouldn't normally or discussing subjects of which they know nothing. This didn't seem very original in my initial (uncharitable) assessment—Double Fine's 'Stacking' treads similar ground. However: 'Stacking' is a high-concept artpiece puzzler that I couldn't bring myself to finish. 'Why Am I Dead At Sea' is a  thriller . It has  suspense . It has characters that  appear  to inhabit straightforward archetypes—and then it challenges  you  to figure out whether those characters have contradictory depths, or complementary depths, or no depth whatsoever.  I played through it twice in eight hours.  Highly recommended.",1
Ended up swimming in a pool of blood trying to rescue someone from being burned alive for a god. 10/10,1
one of the best games i have ever played,1
"If you are a fan of old school SHUMPs (shoot'em ups/bullet hell) type games than Sky Mercenaries will fill that need. There is lots of shooting and dodging. You can even flip between 2 ships on the fly with 2 different shooting patterns.  There are a lot of upgrades for each of the 3 ships. Some are temp that you grab while on a level, some are permanent with a RPG like system in place to upgrade each ship in the hanger.  The Devs are very active in the discussion area and if there is any issues, they jump right on them and usually have it fixed within a day or 2. They seem very polite and willing to consider suggestions for the game.  There is a workshop for maps you create in the game and can upload them for others to use. The further along in the game you make it, the more stuff you can put on a map so a good incentive to go as far as you can in the game.  This is a fun game to jump into, shoot some stuff, build up some money and jump out or to have a couple of hours worth of fun.  2 thumbs up",1

Just awesome. Awesomeness by awesome.,1

"I have owned primal carnage, the original game, for almost 2 years now, and when I found out they were giving us a Primal Carnage: Extinction, I was uber excited. Primal Carnage is a fast-paced first-person shooter or action-packed third person offensive game. Basically, it's a deathmatch of dinos and humans. Both teams are equally strong in this game, but most people prefer the dinos, obviously. The difference of the graphics and maps are so stunning compared to the orignal game. I LOVE THIS GAME. Please get it if you are a dino fan. Best game of my 2 years on steam so far.",1
"This is a good game if you know somewhat what to expect. It's no GTA V but for the work that was put into the game, it's quite a refresher from Ubisoft assassins creed series. I liked the open world map and the hacking design even though any third grader knows those puzzles are not hacking. The story was good, but I did hope it would be a bit longer. Overall 8/10",1
"This is the kind of game that makes you want to beat that level no matter what, and it feels good when you do. With a almost destroyed ship clearing waves and waves of enemies. Just when you thought it was over they give you more and you have to find a way to beat them untill they beat you, makes you want to keep those super guns in case ♥♥♥♥ happens :)).  Its a great game that i had fun playing, i have yet to beat the last level, maybe a build full of homing misiles will work.",1

This game is both boring and nonsense.,-1
"Tharsis is a roguelike that only takes 2 hours to learn and maybe 10 hours to master. This is achieved through having very little content(though addition mission have been bolted onto the actual experience to try and mitigate this problem) and having the gameplay be a whole bunch of dice rolls. There is some value in that if one is looking for that VERY condensed roguelike experience, but personally I don´t see it and wouldn´t recommend this over the meatier games in the genre.",-1
"The game itself is not that bad, the idea is nice, and I think that the way it looks is pretty cool. But the questing is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you need 7 items from an animal, and you're busy killling those animals for 10 minutes and you just got 5. I dont want to kill those animals for 15 minutes before I can finish 1 quest. Think about how long it will take to go through the story line. I don't recommend it. They tried, but in my opinion they failed.",-1
"I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the Action RPG genre. The bread &amp; butter of this game is the battle sequences that happen between armies. You can build up your, and your party's, attributes to be better equipped for these battles. Though, there is some redundancy in these battles, there are a lot of variables to change to make the battles feel fresh. From joining a faction's cause to changing the soldiers within your army.",1

(And now I have some nightmare fuel for the rest of my life, but it's okay.)  I came to play, and laugh and to think 'woah, I'm dating with pigeons! haha this is bizarre' ...But I must say I ended this game having my heart broken and I got emotionally traumised. (Thanks PigeonNation.) You get all the routes, then you get the BBL/Hurtful Boyfriend route... The epilogue... And then you want to die drowned in your own tears.  (I'd probably would do this again.

"After seeing and reading up on this game due to recent incidents on the net, i decided to fork over the money and try it. Keeping an open mind, albeit a bit skeptical due to the hype behind it, I must say I was surprised! The game is fairly simple yet strangely complex...almost everything you do has some impact on the story in some way, shape or form. The story is nice and simple, easy to follow without any 'fluff' per se. The combat is nice and different, a combination of timed attacks and bullet-hell dodging, with a mix of something I wont spoil. Music, it was nice. It fitted the atmosphere of the stages and battles, and the sound effects were pretty well done as well. Graphics, they reminded me of those from the NES days, and that's not a bad thing! I really like how the characters seem alive, even the weakest of the badies to the strongest of bosses. All in all, for $10 it's a game worth trying. Is it the best thing since *insert whatever here*, maybe not, but is it a good game, yes. I personally give it a 9/10. Now to stay determined and make friends with everyone...or just gain some EXP and LOVE",1

I really appreciate its art style, I like the music and voice acting in this game (all twenty of the voice actors did a phenomenal job), and the puzzles are very memorable! Double Fine stayed true to their word that the second act would be much tougher than the first!  I was so glad I got to back the game, as well as beta-test it.

The gameplay style is great for a person into casual gaming but there are rewards for those who want to complete every aspect of the game. The gameplay is truly original and I've never seen anything else like it. It's so simple yet not boring at all. But the part that really sticks with you the most is the beautiful story. There are 3 endings that can be seen after beating the final boss of the game and let me tell you: they really make an impact on you. This was an absolutely wonderful game and I'm so glad I played it. You can really tell this was a passion project for the developer and I hope he does more work in the future.

"Things I never knew about this game: Ubisoft made the controversial decision to not release the epilogue for PC, which did get the original game. A Ubisoft community manager stated that the DLC was not released on PC due to 'business reasons'. The decision led to an outcry in the PC community.   This is just ♥♥♥♥ing bs. ♥♥♥ hats. Since the original 'ending' of the game is SO unsatisfactory...but afaik the DLC ending isn't much better anyway.  Things I hate in games in general: - Fancy menus that put style above usability. Seriously, waiting several seconds for every menu to 'load', just because you wanted a stupid animation every time you opened ANY menu!? FU - Unskippable cut scenes...screw you - Unskippable 15 minutes credits scene? Screw you even more  Now this PoP has nothing to do with any of the others. New hero, new side kick, new combat, new mechanics, no more Sand (of Time at least). So no reversing or slowing time or anything else like that.  Instead you get a sarcastic, snarky hero (really liked him) and a pretty naive princess (her not so much). The game consists of 'cleansing' several areas and defeating the area boss. You do so by unlocking 4 different powers, of which 2 are pretty much exactly the same for whatever reason. To do so you need to gather glowing light orbs that spawn once an area has been cleansed. You guessed right, that means tons of backtracking. However, at least you don't need all of them. I think about 65% of available light seeds need to be collected, which, frankly is rather stupid, because by the time you unlocked the last power to reach the final 4 areas and 2 area bosses you have already collected as many seeds as necessary in the game and there is no need to collect any more...sooooo. Someone didn't think this through.  Traversing the terrain is pretty standard PoP, but easier, since the controls are MUCH better this time around. There are also almost no puzzles and traps in this game (only a few in the end game mostly) and getting lost is virtually impossible since you have a navigation system with Elika, your partner in crime. Speaking of Elika, she is THE most annoying side kick in terms of game play...she constantly follows you around and you need to lift her up or switch positions with her. Every action takes time and takes away from the fluidity of game play. You also need her to turn a turnstile...really, that means waiting for her to come over, every time. Since many puzzles rely on turning those all the time, this gets really annoying. On the other hand she is required to traverse the new 'power plates' (yes, those powers), which are 'wall running', 'flying' and two 'jumps'. Flying is easily the most frustrating one, since it's the only once requiring real input, but makes it so dubious to see where you have to go at times it's just irritating. The other ones are pretty straight forward.  There is no more game over. You simply start at the last check point, which is usually before you leave solid ground to go jumping around somewhere. Health bars are also gone. There is very little fighting in the game now. Only bosses and some random enemies. You now fight only 1 on 1, blocking and countering enemy moves. That works surprisingly well, until you meet a boss you can't damage directly or until the boss just activates 4 quick time events after another...all the time. You also can't lose a fight anymore. The enemy simply gets health back when you mess up. It gets old really fast, because the system does not evolve at all. Thankfully the bosses are mildly interesting.  The story is bleh.  This is a PoP game to grab on a discount if you're bored. However, it's not bad enough to give it a 'no'.",1
"Borderlands2 is amazing and very varied depending on which character class you choose. Once you have finished the main main guest line there are a huge number of additional quests of varying quality/interest. So if you try some and you feel like 'nah, this is not that exciting' do yourself a favor and get Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep (DLC) which shows up as a lilac quest symbol on your map (i.e. the lilac question mark). This leads you to the most hilarious string of additional quests ever: A role playing game inside the computer game, designed by Tiny Tina. She makes the game up as you go along and she borrows heavily from 'Dungeons and Dragons' as well as 'Skyrim'. I laughed so much that I could hardly handle the combat -- which is not a good idea as the opponents are bad ♥♥♥. Go get it!",1
"It's very pleasant visually and narrative is good and touches on many points not many video games go for, while thankfully avoiding being pretensions.  Puzzles that are necessary to progress the story are challenging but at the same time not so hard that you would be stuck on them for days. Additional puzzles are sometimes completely insane, but they are there if it's something you are looking for.  A lot of thought is put into preventing motion sickness for people that get it in first-person games, which I personally appreciate a ton.  Overall one of the best games I played in the recent years.

This game is really fun. Im glad that this game have vac system if not we wouldn't have so much fun go ahead buy the game ;),1
"Do not buy this is you are looking for a scary game. It is NOT scary. Instead, it is just atmospheric. I bought this to play with friends (and it looks good in my library), and it is rather fun to play with other people.   6.5/10 overall",-1
"This game is very strange, but in a good way. It gets a little bit repetitive, but nevertheless if it goes on sale I recomend you buy it. I've played this game before on xbox, and it was okay. It is way better on steam (pc) than on xbox or ps3. I give it an 8.5/10 because of the story line and mostly the voice acting. Also, this game reminds me of borderlands. If you like that game you might like this game, but with less guns.",1

"  It was a hot day on the arid island of Altis. My AI companions and I daydreamed of pizza all throughout our patrol. As such, I signaled one of the boys to place an order. We were notified the pizza was on the way to our position, and waited hungrily in one of the various abandoned houses on the outskirts of Altis. However, all was not well. After twenty minutes had passed, a voice on the other end of the radio sprang to life, informing my four man squad of a complete travesty; our pizza had been stolen by CSAT forces.  I sprang into action immediately, retrieving the nearest Lynx and jumping into the nearest vehicle, said vehicle being a sedan. I yelled for my men to get in, but the poor boys couldn't move from their sheer hunger. I bid them farewell and went on my way; this had become a one man mission. And it was personal.  I sped over the terrain, quickly meeting up with the team that spotted the damned pizza bandits. The aroma of pizza was wafting up the nearby hill, overwhelming my fellow soldiers. I threw myself back into the sedan, stopping just on top of the hill. It was time.  I set up my trusty Lynx, and set my sights on the CSAT officer. Around him were three to four other men, all prepared to consume my delicious pizza sent from the heavens. Without a moment's notice, I fired. Down went the officer, sending his men into a panic. I swifty ended their existences one by one. With the area clear, I ran into the previously occupied house to the unwelcome smell of something burning. I looked to the oven with a look of dread plastering itself over my face.  The pizza was burnt. While I was exacting my revenge, the very objective had been left to heat up for too long.  I sprinted from the house and back into the sedan. I launched over the terrain of Altis at full speed; I had to get another pizza, no matter what. But disaster struck. In my haste to drive the four klicks to the nearest Dominos, I sped up a hill and became airborne. I braced myself for the result of my folly. The car flipped over and began rolling once it hit the ground.  Broken glass slashed across my face, and the whiplash was making me sick. The car finally stopped rolling, and remained on it's side. I crawled out of the car via the broken windshield and cried out with pain. My leg was done for, my ribs ached, and blood spurted from the long gashes I'd received.  I laid upon the ground, defeated. I gazed up at the sky, my vision beginning to blur. A light was coming closer, on it's way to envelop me. But something deep within me rejected that light. The sheer desire for a damn good pizza burned within me. I can't give up here.  I managed to sit up, and began performing first aid on myself. I pulled glass shards out of places I didn't even know the human body had, bandaged gashes that would turn into magnificent scars, and snapped my leg back into place. I got up and began moving towards the objective on foot. Two and a half klicks to go.  I had only moved half a klick however, when the radio sprang to life once more. My squad had been discovered by an enemy MRAP. Horror filled my mind as I listened to the sounds of good men being shot like starving dogs. And all I could do was move forward. And then it was silent. I frantically called out over the radio, but no one responded. My men were gone.  I walked on in silence, until finally, there it was. Tears streamed down my face as I stood in front of the Dominos. I ate pizza like no man had ever eaten pizza before.  11/10 best Military Sim and Workshop content.    In all seriousness though, this game is amazing. It's especially fun to play it with friends, be it screwing around or being tactical. Just don't expect it to play like other shooters. ArmA is a completely different breed.",1

"Should you buy this game ? Hell Yeah.  (Price tag may be a little bit high but wait until it's like 25 % off) Imagine you are the only guy alive in a research facility on a distant and hostlie planet . Oh , and you are being hunted by mutants , zombies and robots. Ammunition and supplies are scarce. And don't forget the perma-death. When i play this game i have that Bioshock 1 feeling , like when you dont know what is going to pop out and when , and you always need to scavenge and conserve. Crafting is nice and you have a large array of weapons. Apart from weapons you got some cool gadgets (a good example would be the detector). This is not a typical run and gun. No. You must think and ALWAYS proceed with caution. It also has a pretty rich backstory , but you will discover it as you play. On top of that , every playtrough is randomized. Oh and i almost forgot , there is only 1 bar of chocolate in the whole game and it heals more than a first aid kit. If that doesnt convince you to get the game , I dont know what will do it.   If you are a survival / horror / shooter fan and you want a challenge get this game. Final Mark : 9 / 10",1

"Maps are very linear, mostly objective based, although very creative in looks, not very creative in play, nor very fun to play.   Weapons are unbalanced and feel very flat to shoot. Main issue is that you get them all, fully loaded ready to go, at every respawn. So the rocket launcher is basically the main weapon to use, and annoyingly get killed by every 40 seconds.   I was really hoping for something similar to the old army men 3d games. Bigger maps centered around childhood imagination with vehicles and humor.

"I have written only a couple of revies in my time on steam. I've just finished playing this for the first time and i felt i must immediatly add my two cents:  What an amazing game. Yes people are complaining about the combat but i find it acceptable. Having never played Batman (which is what it is being compared to) I cant complain. It works.. they either patched it since the complaints or people are just overly picky about it. The only thing that bothered me though was the camera, it just doesnt feel right sometimes.  Combat problem aside. The rest of the game is amazing. The Dealer is voiced so well he makes the game for me. Along with the cards themselves, the stories they tell hooking me in.   I still havn't completed the story yet, I've had some really bad luck on some of the runs. There is enough game here to keep me coming back. Infact ive spent 9 hours on the game and that was all in one sitting. I still have a lot of cards to unlock and even when that is done, there is endless mode.  There are enough variations in enemies to keep the combat and draw interesting.  In one run i was doing really well and was on the last floor, after a very hard struggle of ups and downs id finally made it to within one square of the boss tile. All i had to do was defend myself from an ambush by a falling log 'Easy enough' i thought.. but then the draw. First enemy 'Queen of plague' .... 'well atleast it cant get any wo..' second card 'Jack of plague' ......... Needless to say that run ended there. But i laughed at my misfortune and moved on with the next run.  Pros: Narration is A+ (I just wish there was more but even the repetative narration isnt a bad thing.) Cards tell wonderful little stories. Variation of curses on each boss dungeon to keep it challenging. Game of chance/skill with picking the right outcomes. Random runs Simple combat. (I personally think a complicated combat system would take away from the rest of the game.)  Cons: Frustrating at times when the luck goes against you. camera angle in combat (very minor issue personally)",1

"So far I have played Dota 2 for 1 day, and I'd like to share my feelings about it.  Unfortunately it's lacking one of the most important aspects of a game, which is being easy to pick up, but tough to master. This game doesn't cater to beginners. If you have never played a MOBA, then even the tutorial will be hard. But I watched some guides on YouTube and followed the instructions. It helps to use the easier characters first, like Viper and Lich. It's still fun, but frustrating deep in the battle when you die and it takes about 2 minutes just to get back to where you were unless you spend gold.  But with all that aside, I would recommend it to anyone who likes MOBAs and those who just wish to expand their horizons. I look forward to improving, and with a little practice, I think it could be one of my favorite video games.  Edit: We see how that turned out.",1

"I would give this game 9/10, but it's difficult. Like really difficult. Hell, I'm not able to do first mission even on easy mode, after I capture first 3, the enemy sends in endless waves of soldiers and armoured vehicles, and I'm not able to hold it on my own. Also, the first mission for every country IS THE SAME. Capture about 9-10 checkpoints, then proceed to next misson. I've bad feeling next missions are gonna be the same.  You can use enemy weapons for your soldiers, you can pick up helmets, carefully pick off enemies with sniper, but not really, because at most times, the enemy turns full ape-♥♥♥♥ after you complete several checkpoints in missions, so there's no time to do such things. If your tank(s) get destroyed, your crew jumps out, which is nice, since you can use them not only to repair your tanks, but to repair enemy tanks and use them. But then again, not really, enemy won't give you chance to do it.  This game is just difficult for me, I don't know why. I can't do more than 2 things at the same time, control several units at the same time, but enemy can, ofc. Easy difficulty feels difficult, but you can't go lower. If you're good at these games, you're gonna absolutely love it. Graphics aren't bad, pretty good for this game if you ask me. If only there was AI help for every mission, just like in introduction, it would be so much better.  I can't really give this game anything, since I haven't done even the first mission on any country and I'm not really gonna play this game any longer due to personal probs, but so far, 7.5/10.  I mean, repair enemy stuff and use it against him? Hell yeah!",1
"Absolutely the weakest interactive novel from this studio that I've played.  It is more focused on gender issues than plot, and it shows. The Mysterious Alien Being is shown as transgender for no reason at all, with all the pronouns (Hir, Ze etc.) when NOTHING indicates its gender or lack thereof (based off a single short encounter)! We get to know that the main protagonist had 'freedom to experience their sexuality without restricting gender roles', that's very profound I think, but boring to mention. I'm to play a game, not entertain in gender studies, thank you. The number of remarks about gender is staggering and off-putting. That's too heavy handed.  Plot... revolves around biggest cliches in SciFi ever. Defend your world from aliens, ok. Standard, but sensible. Go to a planet that holds a mysterious mortal combat tournament between Good and Evil where contestants are from all the galaxy. Now, this is cliche, contrived and childish. There was an old He-Man episode with a similar plot, and it was done better. This is the laziest SF cliche of them all, that allows you to show many alien species and interactions between them without all that pesky world building. Including a map of the planet Versus at one point was a mistake, since the locations made me cringe - single castle, single forest, single range of mountains, single love lake in a shape of a heart... I've read Polish communist children books with better maps than that when I was 8. Either make a good map or no map at all.   We have flashbacks within flashbacks, game mechanics many times rammed in our face, and later, a wonderful option of buying a cheating DLC, forced on us during the actual game in a dialog. Hint: things like that ruin the immersion a bit. Had I wanted to by the DLC I would, now please gently let me play the game I've already bought.  I've enjoyed Choice of the Deathless, Hero of Kendrickstone, Choice of Robots and other games from the same studio. They had good plot or interesting scenery or great character development and often all of those. This one has gender studies instead, and a silly map suited for a children fairy tale, not a SciFi story. And I enjoy GOOD children fairy tales, mind you, but don't you think profound mentions of 'sexual experiences not restricted by gender roles' doesn't fit that? Must I tell the author such basics of storytelling, keeping a consistent tone?  Tl;dr; Weak and uninspired, avoid. There are much better games from this studio.  ",-1

After trying the new SimCity, I played it for a bit but it just didn't scratch the same itch. Cities: Skylines scratches that itch and others that I didn't know I had. The modding community is incredibly active and it makes the game even more amazing.  If you value your productivity, vitamin D, and social relationships, do not get this game. But, if you're anything like the rest of us, what are you waiting for? Buy it as soon as you possibly can.",1
This is a fantastic game for a game that is completely free and there for the enjoyment of gamers. It’s an homage to the 8bit adventure games of the past and does a brilliant job. It has some great voice acting with an incredible Viking storyline that follows a lot of Norse mythology. I will admit I wasn't great at it but I still enjoy it immensely. If you are looking to save your money and have a great time then this game was meant for you!,1
"From the first few hours of derping around with this game (as with every RPG maker prior) This has left quite an impact on me. Content wise is vastly better then Ace and VX, with quite an intresting Character generator that i want to tamper with a little, see if i can make a whole set of new sprite types. The plugin system takes a bit of getting use to but i see it as a great way to get deeper into coding and scripting when you feel ready for it, or experimenting with some amazing scripts to enhance that game. i may update this little reviewishy thing since i wanna get deeper into this but i would say if your mind is creative, go for it and make a game with this. tools are there, the drive is all you need now.",1

"Fun game. Can't wait to see if you add more factions or units into, maybe even PvP that would be cool.",1
"My initial reaction to Attila wasn't exactly positive, however after having spent some more time with this game I have to say that I feel differently about it. I still feel that in many ways that this still feels like a Rome 2 expansion pack more than a new game but I have more of an appreciation for some of the new material that has been added since Rome 2. For one they have made it easier to see the way that other factions view you and weather the way you have been behaving is going to better your relations or make things worse, that was a nice touch.  Going through the game as a hoard is much more enjoyable than it had been in Rome: Barbarian Invasion DLC. If I had to make one complaint about it would be that the CPU seams way too eager to raise city’s, during my first play through as the Visigoths I tried to set up a kingdom in southern France but once I got there in around 420AD I found that the fighting that had occurred while I was fighting the Eastern Roman empire had most of Italy, France, Germany and modern Belgium raised to the ground. Save for a few small towns here and there the rest of Europe, except for Spain for some reason, had become a group of wandering hoards after. The amount of time it takes to go through loading between turns is horrible even with the settings turned to 'max performance' even if all I was doing was waiting for units to heal midway through the game I would usually have to wait 4-5 min between turns. I am sure that this will be fixed in a patch at some point because this was a major issue that affected Rome 2 after launch so I am sure this is on the 'To do list' at Creative Assembly. *Sigh* Now here are my gripes about combat... Before I get to what I think about Combat in Attila I think I need to give a little bit of context. One of the big reasons I started to play Total War games in the first place, the combat, I played the crap out of Medieval 2 and all the games that came after and they felt like they had been improving every step of the way. When Rome 2 came out its like troop controls had gone out the window. In combat it felt like more emphasis was being placed on micro managing solders more than generaling. Now you need to pick a formation and make sure that your units actually engage the enemy and if the enemy unit flees that they will either pursue them or resume formation Instead of placing more effort on knowing what part of the battlefield you would want to hold and what kind of formation would be the most advantageous. In my experience once an enemy had been driven off the unit might just stand where they were and not move, they would not regain formation, assist a unit that was in combat nearby just simply stand there. I don't know what the reason was for dumbing down the infantry but it all but ruined the real time battles for me I would have preferred to worry about making sure that my units weren’t abandoning the battle to chase down a unit of a handful of men that were in full retreat than of losing units that just mosh pit together and only react when getting attacked. Most of the battles I have lost are because I end up losing too many men as they get all grouped together and then they allow themselves to get flanked in all of the other games it was bad news if you got flanked but only in this one would it go so spectacularly poorly as they don’t seem to react until they are being attacked even other units smooshed in to their formation won't react those units might as well be on the other side of the map.  I was pretty happy with the improvement that had been made to auto battle. since I wasn't exactly planning on going into real time battle I thought it was a nice touch to select how your general would approach the battle and how that would impact the fight. When it comes to Attila I think they dropped the ball, I haven’t noticed any real changes to the way infantry or ships play in real time battle and to boot they removed the breakdown that said how the way you approached battle so while you can still select weather your general will use an aggressive, defensive or balanced approach it’s a bit of a craps shoot as to how that will affect the battle. Trust me I want to love this game but I have a lot of hang ups on the way that Real time battle is in this game, I honestly feel like I must have missed some kind of prompt that fixes these issues if I am just not doing something right please tell me. I would not recommend this game for anyone that is not a diehard Total War fan and even then I would recommend for the bugs to get fixed and the price to go down a bit.  TL; DR. They made some nice changes to the politics and technology but the combat feels like Rome 2 and that makes me cranky",-1
"First and foremost, I won't be writing a single word about the gender of the creator, any rumors or gossip about her personal life, or anything but the work of art called 'Depression Quest'.  I call it 'a work of art', not because it's perfect, but because it's not really a game, a quest, or an adventure. Someone creative made it using their imagination and talent; that's the definition of art. The somewhat archaic label of 'interactive fiction' is the closest classification, but even that conjures up memories of the zany and fantastical Infocom-era text adventures.  The point of Depression Quest isn't to amuse or entertain you, but to show you the world from a different perspective. That's the point of all art. In this case, the perspective is bleak and grim. From personal experience, I can tell you that this perspective is accurate, poignant, disturbing, and all too familiar. Not just to me, but to countless millions who also struggle with this disease.  In terms of a 'product' being marketed on Steam (and elsewhere), it's pointless to try and use common videogame reviewer logic and terminology. There's no goal, no score, no controls aside from action choices. But you're not playing a game. You are interacting with a written work of fiction. You have limited control over your actions; choices made now may affect future choices. That's kinda how life works.  The point - the entire bloody point of this 'game' - is to put yourself in someone else's place for a little while. Read the text and try to understand and empathize. It may or may not be easy for you; it certainly won't be comfortable. You can roleplay and make your choices based on what you think the game's character really wants or feels; alternately, you can try what YOU think is the right choice, based on your own instincts and reactions. You might choose an option that you genuinely believe would be helpful, but the artwork processes your input through the filter of the character's depression. You might not get the result you expect, but that's how it goes. Depression has a way of disregarding your best intentions and making you behave in unpleasant and unhelpful ways.  Regardless of your actions, life sucks sometimes. For people with depression, it sucks a lot of the time. Depression Quest exists to show people what that can be like. It's not supposed to excite you, challenge your reflexes or your puzzle-solving abilities. It's a work of fiction, a short story fragmented into various rearrangeable paths.   I understand that people have Steam accounts to play computer games. There are tens of thousands of those available here. This is something else. If you're mature enough to read and think and feel for an hour or so, you might well find this an interesting and unique experience. If not, well, stop reading and go back to your fantasy RPG, your platformer, your first-person shooter. The rest of us will keep trying to figure this s*** out and go on with our lives.",1
"It's a gory third-person shooter with Nazi-zombies and an 80's style in music and visuals. It's fun alone and with more people, because more Zombies. I'll give this one a Zombie-Hitler mustache/10",1
"A great game for both the casual gamer and the more hardcore one. Easy to learn, difficult to master, lots of action, an enjoyable soundtrack, and a very fun experience from start to finish! If you like the MOBA games, but want a more relaxed atmosphere in a side scrolling style, this is the game for you!",1
Harder than a priest in a playground. Beautiful and fun as hell though.,1
"I don't know many hours this thing says I've played, but it's wrong. I got this game when steam didn't even exist and it is the epitome of what games ought to be: worth the damn money.  Obviously it's Star Wars, so it's got that whole world going for it, even if it is now part of a disavowed canon. But beyond that there isn't a lot happening that was ground breaking for RPGs (maybe the decision based morality system, but I am not certain about that). So why should you buy it and play a thousand hours?  The story.  It's a compelling story of redemption if you want it to be. It's a compelling story of fate if you want it to be. It's just whatever you want it to be. Add in all the mods currently available and it is literally whatever you want it to be. Also, the restored content mod adds originally designed items and quests that got left out because LA loves to rush their ♥♥♥♥ to the market before it's finished.  I mean, if you want to 'be a Jedi', there are better games. Battlefront. Jedi Knight II. To an extent, the Force Unleashed series. All of these let you control more of the force powers and have something more akin to actual saber combat. But this game is all about the story:  Sith versus Republic, a band of warriors brought together to fight for (or against) peace, and a mysterious stranger recruited to help defeat (or supplant) the Sith apprentice become master, Darth Malak. You travel to worlds across the galaxy in order to figure out how the Sith are building their fleet more quickly than the Republic can defeat them. And with the addition of the 'grey' Jedi, those who are neither light nor dark, maybe you decide it's best to sweep away the remnants of the Galactic Republic and rule it yourself.  I mean, it's not canon anymore anyway. Do what you want.  Recommended Buy, but only on sale because it goes on sale so often. It's worth the extra money, but I believe in you and your ability to exercise self-control until it's 75% off.",1
A Must play game Short but sweet Pros -It is FREE -Easy Achievements -The game's plot is very good -Excellent music and character creation  Cons: There are none. Play the game and enjoy ,1
"The game is notable for its over-the-top cartoon gore and wealth of character customization options. Players can alter the appearance of their in-game avatar as well as the properties of their weapons. Loadout is the type of game that you honestly can’t believe you’re getting for free. The amount of fun you’ll have, the amount of customisable options and features on offer, will leave you with an experience that most wouldn’t mind paying for at all. The cartoon-style graphics and characters are charming, the fast-paced action and fluid combat exciting, and the ability to customize your weapons to such an extent is fantastic and sets it apart from other shooters.",1
"i hope you'll buy this great game. and you can forget real all when you played. if this game is not good at one, you are another. well, he cannot even say future is now. anyways, you have to play this game altime.",1
"Beautiful game, better than most rts's out there",1
"This game is quite rough around the edges and the devs for the most part seem to ignore fans demands to fix the game, clear out hackers, and continously add more heists which could be easily done if they allowed the game to be on the workshop but even then they'll probably never do it.  If nothing else get this game on sale but honestly despite putting as many hours as I have into It hoping Overkill would improve the game only to make it worse I just cannot recommend it.   Pros - Plenty of content - Varied amount of heists and difficulty settings - Mask customization system  Cons - Needless filler content like infamy system that is similar to that stupid call of duty prestige system. - There is no way to shut bain up and for those new to the series even if you know how to play a heist you will have to hear his annoying voice every time you play a heist telling you the same ♥♥♥♥. - Hackers have for the most part ruined this game so unless you can find 4 legit players to start private games with then this game isn't your thing. - The game despite being out for 8 months at the time of this review is still a buggy god awful mess with enemies clipping through walls, AI seemingly being able to see you through walls, etc. ",-1
"Actually it's not a real game, but a simulation... When you start to understand how to use it, it can become addictive!",1
"This game is bad. The controls are bad, and it just doesn't work at times. So why do I like it so much? Because for those reasons, the game can cause so many hilarious moments. Dropping a saw into someones rib cage and watching the damage? Priceless. So I definitely say pick it up if you want a few laughs, but not if you want a working game.",1
"It's free, and it's fun to watch your friends die.",1
"Excellent game. There are a couple of issues, such as unstable fps or crashes, but I'm sure they will be fixed.",1
great idea of co-op heist !!!,1
"probably the best casual game i've played, and definitely up there on the tower defense scale too. get it on ios if you can, since it's like 1/10 the price and controls better",1
if you think away the arty spam its a really good game  6 euro for the dutch?? are you insane??,1
"This is the best Robotron type game I've seen so far. It's essentially just Robotron with modern arcade game innovations added (upgrade points, hit points, more enemy types, more general variety), but it's very well done. Being able to aim with the mouse cursor makes it more fun and interesting than the original Robotron which only let you shoot directly up/down/left/right.  I got this on sale as part of a bundle for less than $1, and it's a must buy at that price. Unlike a lot of games you can get for les than $1, this one is well worth the hard drive space.",1
"I looked at reviews before buying this game, I know it is a console port.  After playing this game, I have decided that I really don't like console ports.  This is the last time I buy one.",-1
It's dope.,1
"A very interesting game indeed,i wansn't sure of buying this game at first,but the story was so incredible and all my money was worth it.4 beautiful anime girls with different personalities and barely any clothes,everything is just incredible. 10/10",1
"I mowed 2 acres of lawn for my dad so I could buy this  I get it, and it crashes every time I click off to the pause menu  Uninstalled, now going through 8 hour download again    0/10 would mow lawn again",1
One Way Heroics is a unique game. While at first it seems a little grindy and nearly as death embracing as Dark Souls underneath this veneer the game sparkles. It has some great classic (cliche if you will) story segments that are randomly generated each time you restart and also it has a slight dry humor to some dialogue whichis quite refreshing. The music is beautiful and suits the game and does not become annoying. Perhaps the most astounding thing is that the creator found that other game creators couldn't meet his system needs so he built his own! (WolfRPG) which is quite a feat. Though it would be hard to integrate some multiplayer DLC or sequel would be a great addition to this title. I highly recommend this since it comes at such a low price!,1
It's a really bad game. But you cannot stop reading it.   Tip: Do NOT play this!,-1
wow cant belive i paid nine dollors for this cod ripoff,-1
A truly fantastic zombie game. Challenges you and up to 3 friends to survive the zombie apocalypse in one of several situations. An absolute must for survival game fans.,1
"A hardcore shooter, Insurgency combines the tactical precision of Arma with the simplicity of CoD. It has comfortable, fleshed out mechanics which are still simple and easy to play with.   The community is great, in matches many people will have a Mike on and be chatting not only about the terrorist in on the balcony but also joking around and creating a really fun environment to play in.  During a steam sale this game is a must have, if you still have reservations check out TotalBiscuits review:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iMxjlHU9u38 ",1

"Best game I have ever played in my life. Worth the 20 cents that I bought it for, but I assure you, the money you're saving for the next Call of Duty of Battlefield should be invested for this masterpiece instead. The beautiful graphics are mesmerizing and beyond next-gen capabilities. The physics engine must have had a lot of work crafted into as well. I spent countless hours playing this game and I can tell you right now that plenty more will go into it. 10/10.",1

"For a game as visually beautiful and full of atmosphere as this is, the game itself, well.. kinda sucks. The visuals, as mentioned before are stellar. I am not exaggerating when I say that this game is gorgeous. The sound, likewise, is amazing. This game really could be described as a work of art.   Now if the game wasn't so full of bugs and bad play mechanics, it might actually be a joy to play. Right about the point where you start to get into the meat of the game, it becomes an exercise in frustration. From bugs that prevent moving forward because of bad wall/ledge detection, to a stupendously BAD aiming/shooting mechanic for the bolo, this game sets you in places where it's almost impossible to progress. A shame because everything else about the game, from the wonderful cultural videos, to the amazing stylistic storytelling, to the aforementioned beautiful visuals, is PERFECT.   But the game is so fricking frustrating I simply cannot recommend it for purchase.",-1
"If your computer can handle it, so can you.",1
This game is wonderful for people who love card games XD,-1
"Originally the comparison between Saints Row and GTA came up, now the game compares more to crackdown. You have super powers which render any form of transportation useless. You still want to use tanks, or ufos to do the side quest due to the sheer firepower they possess. You can customize your vehicles like in 3 but you probably won't since there is absolutely no point as you won't be using them. With all of that being said, this game is actually really fun and it's worth playing and screwing around and blowing crap up. The main story has enough variation and humor to be really awesome. Saint's of Rage being my favorite part. The game is different than 3 by being a super hero sim this time around. The difference means you may go back to playing the older one to suit your need for a kinda more realistic thing or to this one for whacky super hero playground.",1
"Well I gotta say. They did a grand job with this one! The story has some emotional depth to it as far as the characters go and that's one primary thing I look for in a game. When I can feel like I am attached to the people I get engrossed rather quickly. The re-design of interface is nice, I love how the AI has been reworked to better match your battle decisions as well. It gets scary for sure, you feel like you're going to die....alot. At any rate I enjoyed the last Shadowrun even though I'm not very far into it but I must say that this Shadowrun holds a bigger candle to the glory of the last one. I would recommend this!",1

Mod it with Superman Mod and have the most fun you will ever have in an open world game. Superman Mod alone makes this game worth it.,1

"*krypt scary (very scary), if you have health problems (such as heart attack) or similar things forget about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ krypt, it scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me, those spiders especially.... There should be a less scary version, an option to choose.  *Note: There is a glitch at the spider cavern in krypt, there is a door in the south (kavern of doom) which will lead you to the spider gem i believe. Tap the keys as hard as you can but still you won't get the door open.  *better to play with a console, keyboard is not suitable for this game.  *they (mkx team) are still having online gameplay issues, *crashes to desktop oftenly, still having graphical issues,  *they should change 'test your might' and adopt it to pc. Smashing keys ain't helping. *needs sometime to recover, it won't be a good choice to buy this game at its current stage",-1

"This game is an outstanding FPS with a wide variety of weapons to unlock and missions to complete, a few glitches around the corner but all in all it is just an amazing game",1
I dont know how much time I put into this game some reason it isnt even in my steam library anymore. I had fun while I played the game but it got repetitive very quickly. There werent a lot of people playing it a few years ago I imagine the amount is a lot less now.,-1
"I personally loved the minimalistic style, especially graphics wise. The game itself is pretty predictable, meaning that most elements you come across give you an immediate idea of how or where to use them (and whenever you may be wrong, there's a chance you'll get an achievement for your creative thinking); furthermore, the character's thoughts constantly appear on top of the screen and they often act as hints to help you figure out what needs to be done next, so there's no chance to be stuck or find the chapters difficult to solve.   It gets pretty catchy, especially with the switching between the past and the future so often. I finished the game in 3 hours, then played a little more to complete all the achievements. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is searching for an interesting point and click game to play.",1
"is it optimized? yes does it run at 60fps? yes does mouse and keyboard work well with it? yes does it look good? yes Does it look better then console version? yes  i played it on xbox one earlier today and i notice the difference in some areas moreso then others does it look 10x better then console does it look better overall indeed it does.  did rockstar have enough servers to make gta 5 playable online at launch? no (kinda didnt surprise me anyways) was it worth the wait for the pc version if you already owned a xbox one or ps4 version? thats up for debate im undecided   i dont write reviews often games cause i suck at writing them anyways, if you havent owned gta 5 its a must have to own especially on pc.  if you dont have a very good gaming pc but already own a xbox one and or ps4 but are thinking about trying the pc version you can if you want but it wont be worth it in my opinion.  benchmarks will follow  specs: i5 4670k 3.4ghx oc to 4.4 ghz  16gb of corsair ddr3 1600mhz  gtx 970 g1 gamining edition  anyways theres the most important specs i maxxed out the game at 1080p using very high and ultra settings when possible with 8x msaa then theres the option of 4xmsaa with txaa i tried both the second option used a little less gpu ram and looked same as first option in my opinion and ran the benchmark mimumum fps was 26 max was 60 (vsync was on) and it uses 3764mb of the 4096 mb of availible video ram mind you thats everything up even in advanced settings so heres the wrap up  60fps nice its very well optimized mouse and keyboard are great and work good even for driving its a definite graphical improvement sometimes more noticeable then others but dont expect it to be mind blowing difference if you played ps4 or xbox one   overall 9/10 (hype made it lose one point same with gta online not working)(which was partially expected)  disclaimer i am candian and trevor doesnt represent canadians LOL!  ps this is my opinion your milage with the game may vary    edited:: alot of people are having widespread issues with game not working from what i heard people that have it threw steam are having no issues for the most part people who got it threw rockstar warehouse are having issues for the most part so i hope there issues get fixed and whoever buys it doesnt have those issues just a warning",1
"For the Shogunate !  Total War : Shogun 2 or Shogun 2 : Total War Review  This is my first (or third total war game , if you count empire and the original shogun demos) . Suffice to say I'm rather new to this type or Turn-Based Strategy with Real Time Tactics game. And yet this game is able to capture my attention for the first time I played the tutorial. Perhaps its because I'm new to this genre, the addiction of seeing my armies tactically win a skirmish because of good position attacks is strangely satisfying. Taking a severe loss can be heart brokening especially if you had the advantage. Outnumbering the enemy that has 2000 troops defending a castle with 6000 troops has it... tingling feeling (and the evil thought of the enemy army being obliterated) and some goosebumps as well. Those are the feeling that I have when playing Total War : Shogun 2. Now onto the review itself.  For the new user experience (new to this genre) , it can be... quite the game depending on what happens. For me it was literally a giant puzzle, the tutorial explained well, but was painfully slow to listen to , its skippable, but too much inportant info lies there. Your first few battles would be... okay if your not a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who throw archers into melee mode while your samurai hangs at the back. For those who are experience with this genre (those who played previous titles) it should be nice to see an upgrade in its combat refinement or rather its simplicity but still provide enough factors to blow your mind as usual.  For casual players its pretty fun, it will take up at least 1 hour if your going thru the campaign casually (with the RTT battles of course) . By this point simply understanding of tactics should come into play and the amount of exploration for units, technologies, buildings, and faction is a lot which can keep you pulled in for a long, long , long time. After all just... 1... more... turn... In multiplayer I cant say... I never found a match so far so its blank here.  For the 'PRO' I wont say much as Im not pro yet, but it would seem that large scale micromanagement would be need to effectively win against the hardest of AIs. The most minor of details such as weather, unit stats and levels, the options available to you ( fight this guy or both ) is a lot to take in. But it should not be a problem. For ODA !!!  Now graphics wise this aint the Witcher 3 , so dont expect world renowed graphics, however the details generated on High settings is very nice to see, each plated armor's reflection, the arrows that hits and object , the waving grass as your army marches , very nice. However particles (like fire) and water the (looks and feels) needs a lot more fine tuning, but neglegible.  Music, hohoho very... Japanese-sy (I know that's not a word), still its pretty good to hear, calm when its peaceful and exciting when you are fighting, but its getting boring real fast for the battle map music..  Price : Hmmm... I never ever , ever , ever recommend any games paid in full (when release or after 10 years) , but I will say it totally worth the price when its 75% off during sales.  Progress wise, there isnt any... unless you counting the progress system of your campaign game. For multiplayers or the 'Avatar Conquest' there is progress, but I dont really play it , so from MY experience , the progress in this game is pretty non-existant.  Now I know this game has SinglePlayer, Co-op and Multiplayer, so Im not sure what kinda of main theme they are focusing on since I didnt play co-op (yet) and didnt play multiplayer a lot. But if its singleplayer focused, then they did a great job, a very good job at it. They stuck to the Japanese theme quite well, called the unit correctly, maybe.. kinda.. (Yari Ashigaru and not just 'Spearmen') for the Sengoku Jidai era. But I kinda wish there were more... options for the faces of the Daimyo.  Community, uh.... no comment , since i have little to no interaction with them, but the community mods, dayum they are good , sooooo guuuuuuuuuud.  Its it fun YES and NOO, if you like spending quite some time, willing to brainstorm, love this genre, love to watch littlemen poke each other, love the feel that you won the battle by using your brain (finally something my brain and do without failing , unlike my Maths test) , then this game is for you.  If you dont like waiting a lot, suck at micromagement completely, or just plainly hate this genre, then dont touch this game. But in MY OPINION, this game is FUN and worth getting.  Serious score (with severe nitpicking) : 60. 77% Normal score (casually thinking) : 84. 54%",1
"Dope game, buy it.",1
Totally awesome game well worth the price even if not bought off the indie bundle. Also Hard Mode is balls hard they arent kidding around with it.,1
If you like the old 2d side scrolling games then you'll like this.,1
You catch bad people.,1
"Very nice graphics,sounds.....who cares about them?!? Is so fun and cool :D",1
"A strong narrative experience wrapped around solid and enjoyable action gameplay. Plausible, relatable characters with some genuine depth to them, along with a wide variety of enemies that challenge you to improve and adapt as you play. A smallish but well-chosen selection of weapons, larger if you consider the offensive potential of your giant mining robot... which you should, because not every game that lets you pilot a giant robot really makes you feel like you're in one -but this one does. It doesn't zip along on jet feet, sure, but that just makes it feel more real, more massive.  Controls are quite functional, one issue exists where an incorrect on-screen instruction says 'Rotate W/S/A/D' when it means 'rapidly tap F', but a quick googling could have told you that much. To make it up to you, if you have an Xbox Controller for Windows, you can literally plug it in as you play, use it to do perform the gamepad versions of various tool interactions, then unplug it again to return to mouse aiming. Or you can use it all the time if you like, just saying.  Graphics are perfectly fine, bordering on gorgeous. Depends how picky you are, I suppose, but I find it hard to imagine the type of person who would actually complain. This game has a lot to offer and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys mechs, shooting, narrative or combinations thereof. At its current price of €40, I would wait for a sale, but if you can catch it at a price that works for you, I say don't hesitate. The sound of your rig's soundtrack, echoing across a snow-swept canyon and up to your perch on a recently-grappled cliff, is waiting.",1
"This game could have been interesting if it weren't for the lousy gameplay. After twenty minutes I was ready to uninstall but I hoped it would get more interesting... It did, sort of... The cutscenes are interesting and the whole atmosphere of the game is like an x-files/twilight zone/slasher movie. It is gripping to get to know what's going on. However to get tot the next cutscene you have to play the corridor based game where you have to shine a light on the enemy to weaken then before you can shoot them, or (and this even becomes necessary later on) you have to run away to the next light. That't the gameplay, no literally... that's it unless you count picking up thermoses (what for) and manuscripts. Running away is so critical yet the makers crippled the running so that your character is exhausted after about 5 meters. Uninstalled and will be trying to find the cutscenes on youtube.",-1
Pretty darn fun game to play!,1
amazing one of the first games in a while i cried while i beat it,1
Brilliant.,1
It's a lot better now,1
"There is literally no way to play this game without a controller. Close to the beginning missions you have to learn the basics, one of them, unlocking school lockers. They actually want you to ♥♥♥♥ing TURN YOUR MOUSE CLOCKWISE AND COUNTER-COCKWISE TO UNLOCK PADLOCKS. So I can't play this game until I get a controller. still fun though, I played it alot years back 10/10 Pete Kowalski will always be a ♥♥♥♥ing pussi",1
"A short, text-based adventure. The starting point in the dungeon is a little dull, but in the gallery, the feelings of the occult make this altogether quite enjoyable. Read the books and notes which are left for you, otherwise this will necessarily feel lacking (if you don't want to read, why are you playing a text-based game?). Recommended if you can get this for free, or as part of a bundle, but I wouldn't really pay more than about 0.50 for it.",1
Is a good game and funny with friends ! :tenniscrown: :ghsmile: :tenniscrown:,1
"This.  This is the greatest game you've never played. In its heydey, you could find thousands of people duking it out in carefully-tailored zones that gave no ♥♥♥♥ or apology if you ate ♥♥♥♥. If you died, you only had yourself to blame; you probably shot one too many bullets, tried to burn out and got found, or got your positioning wrong.  It's a damn shame this game doesn't get more folks nowadays, because it was optimized for dial-up modems. With the high-speed everyone has nowadays, this is the most breakneck you can get with people in an old game. Give it a try! Hell, I'd like to give it a try and have someone to play with.",1
Very nice and immersive,1
"Excellent RPG, a breakthough at its time, even now it's graphics and gameplay are still fun, though a bit dated.   A true RPG, the story is fascinating and characters are well developed and really interesting. Decisions you make do have a strong influence in how the game plays out. Recommended through and through",1
"PROS; -Puzzles aren't too easy nor difficult -Controls are easy to learn -No cryptic thinking to exploit the games mechanics in order to pass levels -Campaign length is decent, fun and replayable -Characters add interesting moments at just the right times -Game runs very nice and smoothly on low power/budget hardware -Extra in-game features such as gel add an extra layer of depth to puzzles -Time trial modes  CONS: -Multiplayer can be frustrating when there's lack of co-operation -Some characters may become irritating if not in the mood to deal with dialogue -No multiple ways of solving the same puzzles -Loading screens may sometimes take a while depending on Co-op partner -Some puzzles may lead you to be stuck for a while without looking for guides/help  Overall, I give the game an 8/10. It's a slightly more easier version of Portal with Co-op and new features.",1
This game is really worth to buy.,1
is my favorite game   is the best game ever,1
"I love this game. Like, a lot.",1
This game is by far my favorite game. Nothing about this game was bad. The relationships that you have with the other characters in the game are great. The Story in the game made me feel warm inide from how amazing it was. the gameply and combate were both very unique and creative. The graphics were very nostalgic. And each and every boss was unique in its own way. In my opinion this game deserved to win the game of the year award. I rate this game 10 out of 10.  P.S.    Dont take the genicide route unless you want to have a bad time   ,1

"This game is WAY too fast, but at the same time when not using the booster, you feel slower then everyone else! Everybody always out turns you, you always crash into things and everyones moving too fast to hit! The customization, different ship parts, and weapons are very nice, so is the music. But the actual gameplay is lacking in balance.",-1
this game is suprising as ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to the amount of fun that comes out of it. Not like 95 hours in two weeks fun more like 35 but still fun,1

Granted, there is not really much to do, but just driving those truck through the mud and getting stuck brought enjoyment to me. But here is the thing: Oovee promised a lot of content, even previewed it, and then gave no more updates on their progress. Or rather no updates on anything. It's a great game suffering from a really bad developer/publisher.",-1
Game wouldn't even connect -.- only thing I can approve is Best. Achievement. Names. Ever!,-1
"Injustice is a breathtaking game to say the least, for comicbook fans anyhow. Not much more needs to be said about that! !0/10  ",1
"This game is definitely one that you go to when you find yourself without something to do or are waiting for the next big release. Mechanics of the game are great, and despite the series just having turned 15, it still has a large playerbase. If you haven't bought it yet, get your checkbook out.",1
2/10  Absolute Trash:  Garbage Controls Garbage Gameplay Bad Graphics Bugs Kids Absolute Boring Nothing To Do No People  that pretty much sums up with garbage game,-1
"A great but underated singleplayer experience, one of the best experiences I've had actually.  Sadly it never got the sequel it deserved.",1
buy unfinished game download unfinished game dlc completely optional (overpriced too) go into workshop of unfinished game get mods to your liking download radious no matter what enjoy a now fully functioned (finished) game  the modders saved this title i love warhammer im lonely,1
"Starbound is an enthralling game centered around space exploration, as the name implies. You can explore a near-infinite amount of procedurally generated worlds, each with their own landscapes and lifeforms.  You start off in your ship with some basic tools. At first, you might be confused, but don't fret - simply beam down to the nearby planet in order to get started gathering and creating. You can build buildings, craft furniture, find new equipment, mine rare ores, and more!  With over 1,500 hours of entertainment possible, this game is a must have for any block-game enthusiast.",1
Payday 2 is: When you want to play in stealth. Start heist. Go to the bank in casing mode. And you crash to the guard who came from the corner. RESTART! :D,1
"One of the best games I own. It never gets boring, and the gameplay is so layered that there are always ways to improve. Scoring your first goal, getting your first bicycle kick, and slotting home your first aerial goal are each fantastic moments, and playing with friends only makes it better.  The gameplay is so slick that even if you don't know what you're doing, things feel fast and responsive. The boost mechanic is managed perfectly, giving you an extra layer of strategy once you begin to figure out how aerials work. There is so much to this game that has to be learned, yet you can play at lower levels just fine.   The soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥, the different gamemodes offer new ways to play, and the wealth of customization options only add to the ejoyment. Finally, the matchmaking is done very well, and I've never had a server issue while playing.  If you like arcade-y sports titles with banging soundtracks, slick gameplay, great customization, and fantastic visuals, then Rocket League is for you.",1
"Bout an hour or two long...but so are games such as Journey, keep that in mind! Theres multiple options to do, and I was interested enough to try them all out. Wont spoil anything but it's pretty f'd up",1
"Test level, do not buy.",1
"The game I sunk hours into as a child I can now play untill i get old and die. hasn't changed much, like a fine wine it has aged well.",1
"Considering that the online mode is dead I can't recommend paying for this game, just wait for a discount. Anyway curious game where they exist.",-1
"The game is effectively 18th century naval combat in space, which everything that implies: - Two dimensional movement. Even though in space, your ships can turn right or left, but can't pitch up or down.  - Broadside combat. Sidle up to your enemy and let fly with side mounted cannons.  Even though having a space shooter pinned to a single plane was jarring at first, the game is incredibly solid and polished to a shine, with obvious influences from Firefly, Honor Harrington (even to the point of a having a ship named Manticore), Elite, and Freelancer.   .... and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the game has THE best soundtrack I've heard in years.",1
"Money grabbing DLC fest First RTS game that has exclusive DLC units which are quite powerful. Unless you want to buy lots of DLCS and want to deal with heavily unbalanced multiplayer and cheating AI, do not buy.",-1
"An excellent game. The price is excellent, and the amount of mods and DLC available are well-worth the cost. The mix of RPG and Strategy is excellent, employed well and the gameplay is addicting. Graphics aren't as exciting as other games, like Skyrim. There are some monor bugs here and there, but they don't take away anything from the game's likeability. However, the modding possibilities are endless, and it adds to the game's likeability. You can find any modification about anything and everything that you can think of, and the DLC as well as With Fire and Sword are great! I've been playing this game since it came out, and I cannot get enough of this game! If you're looking for a cheap game with loads of enjoyable gameplay, excellent mods and good specs, this is the game for you!",1
when you finally beat this game your life kinda feels empty,1
Totally Recommended! I do NOT regret any money what i pay for it! Emotionaly story what can move hearts! ,1
"The greed is real! First the massive invasion of Early Access games, now the selling of Mods. What will be next? Shame on Bethesda for supporting this BS!",-1
"Well, this game is quite fun, the classes are decent and the ability to get a secondary class makes it very interesting as you have a wide variety of playstyle you can go for. some people might say its abit too easy but 1-60 is really just a build up, it shouldnt be too hard to level. its NOT Pay 2 win but the costume in AP store is quite stupid as everything is up to luck. The gameplay and community are very good in my opinion, really like the graphic style as well.  There are however a few problems tho, one mainly is the sheer amount of bots inside the game.. i feel like aria is doing a poor job of trying to get rid of them, and also there are quite a few glitches when gliding and jumping as such. Overall good game but definitely has alot of rough edges that needs to be fixed. Would recommend if anime art is your taste and got a few friends to enjoy the game with",1
I recommended this game cause it have a lot of action and funny.,1
Terrible game. Has high framerate drops. The weapons feel all the same. The Animations are ♥♥♥♥ in multiplayer. The Single player is boring - like always. The Graphics dont look that good - The textures are terrible. And The Multiplayer? Has the Same feeling like every 08/15 FREE TO PLAY GAME. Dont make the same mistake like me and million of other players. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING CALL OF TRASH: GHOSTS.  Greetz.,-1
"I make gloryholes,my wife use them .",1
"I got my hands on the game Overture by the guys at Black Shell Games and had a blast with it.  Overture is a pixel art rougelike that is just very deep. There are 4 main classes and each one of those classes has several sub-classes. It has all the things you look for in a game like this. Intense action, loot, more loot, and delicious gold =D  It's set up as a twin stick shooter style of a game that is top down. You must shoot arrows, throw fireballs, and face smash your enemies away.  Overture is many hours of batshit crazy, intense fun.  For more reviews and a bi-weekly podcast about Early Access and Indie Games check out  www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com    https://youtu.be/MT7X5SHRCIs ",1
"I enjoyed this game a lot. Interesting puzzles, mostly challenging without being overly frustrating. Yeah there's a lot of point and click especially if you try to collect every little thing. Well done, interesting story, pretty good graphics. ",1
This game will make you rage unless you have a gold card or better 0/8 m8,-1
Freaking love it! The Atmosphere in this game is so thick you can cut.,1
"Finally after several years I decided to try Condemned out on PC, I remember seeing footage of it years ago and being impressed with the combat, but never really picked it up on xbox.   **Couple things to point out right away in case you are having some issues with the game, there is an issue with stuttering and performance with some Logitech mice, but a simple single directX file can fix it if you search online. Ran really well on my windows 10 system after that, except when I try to quit the game it will force a black screen and a need to reset the whole computer.**    Without going over any key story or any spoilers:  Positives:  Creepy atmosphere Solid jump scares that actually got me pretty bad Interesting story elements that progress in an unexpected way Visuals still hold up on highest settings Lighter collecting aspects(only used to unlock concept art which is a plus) Combat is balanced and I never ran into extremely difficult or overwhelming sections. Detective work was really cool, use of ultraviolet light should be in more games!  Negatives: Your character has the lungs of an 80 year old asthmatic whilst sprinting You walk up stairs like an 80 year old asthmatic There isn't really any progression for your character, you never get more health or stamina Blocking doesn't always seem to work with weapons, strafing and flailing works best Story can be rather thin at parts, I wish they went further into some of the world building which had interesting potential. Campaign was rather short, only took me 5 hours to beat it on normal difficulty.  Overall, I would recommend Condemned: Criminal Origins, I believe I picked it up in an earlier humble bundle so you can always wait until a sale and give it a try if you enjoy first person horror games.   ",1
"First thing I was thinking about when I bought this game: ''it's something like CS:GO, but much better.''. Now I played pretty long, got many achievments, and I would defenitely reccomend this game to anyone who likes to shoot things... I realy enjoy playing it.",1
Nice game to play to relax,1
very good but would be better if and when the new f1 games come out if we get it for free and update f1 2014 to f1 2015 for example but otherwise deffo recommend this game!!!,1
"Very interesting game. It reminds me of mario, if mario let you rewind time. It's very interesting. Sometimes when you rewind time, you can take certain items with you back through time, and sometimes not. You'd think it would get old fast, but it really doesn't. It stays challenging and interesting. And the music is awesome.",1
A classic.,1
bought it when it was on sale. this is so far the best detective game i have ever played,1
Doesn't even run properly and relies on mods to make it even good with all its bugs and flaws. Just get X-COM and OpenXCOM or even Xenonauts. Did i also say the game crashes from its own sounds?,-1
"Really good game, with really good optimisation so you wont lag, and i would recommend it to anyone",1
"Great game, but not the Forza of bikes I was hoping for. It's flawed but it's as good as we're likely to get until a big AAA developer does something based around 2 wheels.  Pros:  The bikes look great. Decent handling on pro and semi-pro modes. Lots of circuits, bikes, and hopefully incoming DLC. Great rider customisation. Well optimised, good performance with options maxed out on a GTX970.  Cons:  The same generic customisation options for each bike is dissapointing. Poor enviromental graphics and textures. Some bikes feel very wonky (supermotos and some of the superbikes). Career mode progression is very dull. Multiplayer is a laggy mess.  Overall, 7.5/10 ",1
"Only supports 1280x720 or 1920x1080 resolution, blurry textures compared to the PS4 version, 30fps.   Only thing good to take away compared to the PS4 version is that they readjusted the blood amount to the original PSP version, as well as dynamic shadows. Does have an optional cheat that changes your controlled character's moving speed.  Think I'll play the PS4 version instead, its pretty hard to look at a cutscene when the character's face upclose is nothing but a smudgey blur, but everything else out of focus is just fine and sharp.  Just a personal opinion, if you love the game despite its glaring features, go ahead. But labelling it as an HD product then failing to deliver that is pretty bad in my book, but its still playable.",-1
"For some reason this game just feels blindingly fast compared to the first game. Sure, it looks better, but it just feels bad to play. If you've never played Audiosurf, get the first game instead. It's considered a classic rhythm game for a reason.",-1
Very fun with friends but why only 2 factions? 8\10  FYI: you will need a very gpod pc for huge battles,1
"Thank you game, for making enemies so grotesque and disfigured I have nightmares at night",1
"You know it’s a good game when you go to sleep and dream about playing more. How does someone make an economic RTS fun? Play this and you will see exactly how. Also the tutorial is really good and gets you up to speed, haven't touched the campaign yet but it’s on my to-do list. Oh and the soundtrack is just amazing.   This game was finished 6 months ago or at least it felt that way (it’s been an amazing experience being part of the early access for it), and it has just been polished and polished to the amazing creation we are presented with. Soren and Mohawk Studios created something that will last a long time in the minds and hearts of gamers, just like Civ4. Highly Recommended, and easily going in my top 10 game list for 2016.",1
really hard but good!,1
Outstanding! A worthy addition to the Fallout franchise with good improvements upon the previous Fallout releases. This vast and colorful open world keeps you entertained for many hours.,1
"More Last of Us than Tomb Raider. It looks amazing and is mechanically well designed, but its attempt at being a gritty origin story for Lara fails due Lara herself being as relatable as a mannequin. The game's depiction of physchological trauma and stress are addressed in very sensational and insulting way.  There was fun to be had mechanically but I can't recommend Tomb Raider due to how it mishandles it's own attempts at being serious.  Below is a more fleshed out Breakdown of what I mean:   http://theboilingpot.net/tomb-raider-adventerous-phsycological-torment/ ",-1
"It has great graphics and absolutely beautiful and touching story. It has awesome puns too:D Totally not an RPG, though. It's actually closer to a visual novel in genre and involves a lot of reading. If you are fine with reading, i totally recomend it:)",1
"A must play game with an awesome story, great graphics and fun gameplay.",1
"I wanted to like this game. I did. I played through about half of it, but while the combat is engaging enough, the rest of the game is a mess. You are never really given any sort of motivation for you character, nor are you ever really made to like her. You are performing actions because you are playing a game, not because you really have any choice in the matter. The lack of connection leads to an utter lack of immersion in the game.   What finally made me quit, though, was one of the 'memory editing' sequences. Through an incredibly kludgy interface, you are supposed to rewind and fast-forward through memories finding 'glitches' and altering them. Pick the right combination and you achieve your goal. The interface is awful and the mouse-waving and right-clicking are finicky at best, which makes having to go back and try other combinations really boring and awful. These sequences aren't common, but having to wade through an annoyance to get back to a lackluster game made me finally ask myself why I wasn't playing something else...",-1
"  This game is awesome, I spent the best 4,5 hours ever. It's addictive and fun.",1
"Dreadful, boring almost like a board game in electronic form. after 3 hours there is absolutely nothing to do. i left the game and made dinner and came back nothing had happened, to have that in the first day of game is dissapointing. to all those that are expecting to build an empire you wont, you have no control of buildings, locations or upgrading buildings with the exception of a few, you plop down a city, build a road which literally takes 3 seconds and set up a trader and thats it-done. now wait for 10 minutes and repeat. I peronally have had it Kalypso, i have wasted so much monry on their hit or miss products and this is definately a miss",-1
The newer COD's can't seem to match up to this one,1
I've played for less than 5 minutes and already had to change my pants   10/10 will play again,1
Absolutely ridiculous. Absolutely. Ridiculous.  Buy it.,1
"Graphically beautiful, unique gameplay mechanic, and a good storyline (particularly the ending). It's only downside it that it's short.",1
  i want to kill whoever gifted me this game,1
"Let me tell you first that I've downloaded this game from a torrent, and played it for 14 hours before deciding to buy it. I have 21 hours in my save game as of the day of writing this review, and I'm far for completing the game at 100%. This game justifies its price by the amount of side quest, and things to complete and unlock.  TL;DR: Highly recommended for those fan of the anime that don't mind repetitive combat , and have a controller(highly recommended, but it's playable with keyboard, no mouse support).  Good things:  It makes you feel in the world of the anime. Original voice actors, and the animations for the movement and attack (of both humans and titans) are almost copied and pasted from the show, there's a lot of momments that you wil think 'I saw this on the show!'. The movement is kind of weird the firs 30 mins of the game, but you will get the hang of it and you will feel like a badass, flying around the city and forest, slaying titans foolish enough to try to make you their dinner. Also, you'll encounter in every mission characters from the show that will join you in your squad (up to 4), that will help you out. The music is okay most of the time, and it has some good tracks in there. It definitly has the 'AoT feel' to them, but sadly, is not the show's music. OPTIMIZATION. Let me tell you they did a great job on that, because I'm running this game on a toaster(Core i3, Nvidia 420 and 4gb of ram). I'm well below of the minimun, but I still manage to play at 30 fps most of the time, with some drops from time to time. The hub areas are really cool, you get to talk with characters from the series and roam around a little. Is just a gimmick but is a nice touch  Bad things: No mouse support. Yes, this is a pc game with no mouse support, and unless you've played Doom back in 1993 you're probably not used to that. A controller is almost mandatory, but I'm playing with the keyboard now because I wanted to try it out, and it's working surprisingly well, although I think that it will be much easier to learn with a controller. The IA sucks. Following the formula of the 'Warriors' series, you're thrown in a battlefield with multiple allies and enemies, but I've never seen the bots kill anything, not even if you set your squad to roam around and kill things, and this kind of kills the immersion for me, because you usually feel like you're doing all by yourself.  Gameplay: Extremly repetitive, but I personally don't care bout it, but beware, there isn't much depth on this game.  Story mode:  You can beat it in around 4 hours, and it follows the anime. After that, you have an epilogue, with a new enemy and scenes from the manga, is like a littel peak into the season 2 of the anime. I should mention that you get sidequest from the characters in the hub area, and after you complete them you get a little cut scene with some story and character developement, again some things seems out of the manga  Expedition mode:  Random missions. There's nothing really new here except for some maps.  'True' Story mode: Unlocked after beating the epilogue of the story mode, a much harder story mode but nothing else really new  Overall I really like this games because I'm a fan of the show, and this game provides an interactive version of the show, but nothing else. If you're not familiar with the show, I can't recommend this game for this price, and even if you're a fan I'd say wait for a sale, but I don't think you will regret it if you buy it",1
Sniped this game at the summer sale and had an absolute blast. It was more stealthy than metro 2033 and it got me totally into the metro experience like i imagined it from the books. Thrilling with a great story.  10/10 would sneak again.,1
i played this and it didnt really scare me but its a good game,1
Game is a blast. Definatly worth the $20. Played thru it once already and starting a second runner. Also looking forward to playing around with the editor and playing other UGC.,1
This game is wonderful! It has an amazing atmosphere and arouses emotions!,1
"but ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents",1
10 / 10 Would play agen,1
"Played 200 hours so far and not finished yet.  Ok where to start. I umbed and ard about getting this game. Thought it might be to basic as I am an old school 4X player who hates old school style games. I wanted a polished state of the art latest gen pc top end game.  Finaly brought it after months of thinking about it. This is waht you get....  A surprisingly well put together game that has all basic gameplay mechanics that work well together. A deep and strategic play through that is always enguaging. AI knows how to play the game. Interface is simple yet very functional. Graphics are good, and could be great if better models were to be created. I am talking about top end textures, lighting of ships. Models are my greatest disapointment as they are about the same or worse than sins of the solar empire (2008). Yes 2008 game trumps some of the texture and models used. Lesson for Paradox, provide some outstanding high end models with more animations. If you are a graphics nerd, do not let it put you off as this game is so good to play it gets away with it. Soundtrack is great. Depth of play is remarkable in that after 200 hours I still feel that I have not reached the games limit. It always feels fresh and interesting. Fustration is minimal concidering the complex nature and size of what is offered. This is the big question. It is complex, it is huge, it is built for veteran 4X players, but if you have the patience it will reward you in spades. DO NOT GET if you want a quick and easy game to play.    This is a single player long game made for any fan of Si Fi 4X games. Combat is hands off, but funcional. If it used Endless Space 2 combat it would be a perfect game. You must like large fleet battles as oppsed to intimate flotilla style combet. Long learning curve required, but interesting. Extensive mod community at work. This game will be the best 4X space game thanks to modders. Everything can be changed,   If you are on the fence and have liked what you have read. Just get it, it is worth every cent. It will only cost you cents per hour to play as it takes ages to finish a game. If you are a die hard fan of complex space 4X, then get it now, plays better than any of the old classics.  Paradox has put together a very polished slick game here and with some better models it is going to be fantastic game for years to come. Well done Paradox, I do not give praise lightly.   If you need a score then as it stands now it would be 9/10  ",1
"This is one of the best scifi horror games I have ever played, the longer you play it the more intense the psychological terror becomes. Nothings worse than C3P0 loaded with explosives trying to give you a hug except maybe a psychic monkey that gave up on sling poo around and decides slinging fireballs at your face is a good idea. If you have never played this you are missing out. Out of 10 I would give this a 10",1
"i Highly unrecomend this game due to its never failing glitching for Macs, such as half the screen disappearing, everthing becoming pixilated, overlapping voice segments, and last but not least, the lovely inability, to not see a damn thing.",-1
"This is a really enjoyable game. The gameplay is mostly just finding stuff around the environment, with a few simple stealth combat sequences and puzzles to mix it up. The story is pretty good, although far too short. Voice acting is top-notch, although the game does suffer from 'Welcome to Corneria' syndrome at times.  If you hate collectables, this is not the game for you, but unlike many other games, you actually get nice rewards for finding stuff here. The side stories are quite interesting.  All in all, this game is clearly low-budget and unpolished, but there are still many endearing and fun features. If you're a fan of immersive environments and detailed lore, don't miss out on this game.",1
This game is great zombie open world so cool,1

"It is a nice game. But when it comes to online, it's really hard to find someone at your level to join them. If you prefer playing alone, I recommend it. 8/10",1
"Awesome game, lots of fun. I have no complaints for online. For season mode, when you play with bots as team mates, they will push the ball into their own net. Kind of annoying when it's the final game and your friendly does that.",1
Zup! is a game that I recommend because:  - Graphics are awsome! - Perfect timekiller! - it has a good price! - it is indie &amp; casual - it has trading cards - Easy achievements   Try &amp; Enjoy!,1
"Well, I bought this and now it's free, should have guessed it would be free at one point considering its name, but oh well",-1
"Pretty good, but the game does have some bugs like crash for no reason.  ",1
"Dying Light.   + Graphics look nice.  + Fun combat.  + Solid freerunning.  + Diverse tactics.  + Good day/night cycle.  + Fun pvp mode.  + Fun coop mode + challenges.  + Challenging early on.  + Decent upgrade system.  + Interesting sidequests, some even tearjerking.  + Nice backstory/lore.   // Average story - Quite typicall, predictable.  // Halfbad lipsync.  // Abit buggy here and there. (No AC-Unity don't worry). // Lack of player choice.   - Male characters look the same, this is a bigg issue. 50%-70% of the male characters look like the NPC Gazi with different facial hair, even important quest npcs etc.  - Nothing to really do after maxlevel. After maxing all skills, you feel like nothing is worth doing since you only get minimal to no reward for doing things (sideobjectives, airdrops, save survivor etc.), would have been nice to see some kind of system in place to counter this.  - All your friends look the same in Co-op except if you have unlocked different costumes, feels quite silly.  - Lack of player customization (bad design), they decided to use clothing for different slots (example: Hats gloves, shooes etc.) but you can only equip them as a full coustume instead of combining it for your self.",1
  One word for each aspect of this game.,1
"Ok, yes, it has bugs. Yes, you have to edit the config file to get it to work in Win 7. Yes, the graphics are dated, the voice acting is ludicrous, and the text is clearly written by people who speak English poorly, if at all.  HOWEVER: It's a fun game. Whether you're just doing the main quest, the side quests, or exploring, it's a blast to play. The truck upgrade system lets you feel you're driving your own unique vehicle. And for 2 bucks (the current sale price) you do get more than you pay for.",1
Great short game but really great.If you get the meaning of this game you might even cry at end.!,1
"Boy: Mama please can i have it! Mama: Your grounded for a year remember you can only get games that invovle thinking! Random guy in the window to Mama: Portal 2 It invovles Thinking and Fun GET IT FOR HIM NOW! Just joking you don't have to Mama watches Videos of portal 2* Mama: fine I kind of like! Boy does angry frown* Mama: Ok Ok i REALLY LIKE IT GIMME GIMME! Boy: Yes! Does a fistpump with his dog* bangs his head on the table*  Well that short story should give you a bit fo detail about the game, this game DOES invovle thinking I find it really hard but my friends always helps me as there is also multiplayer and you can create your own maps.  Hope this helps you whether to purchase this or not Thanks for reading! Bye!",1
"Dont really enjoy the game, to be truthful I would prefer just joining a chat room, to get most of the cosmetics you have to grind or pay.",-1
"Right, after fifty hours of gameplay, I'll get straigt to the point with Pros, Cons and Misc notes on this game  Pros: -Decent Graphics -Good mechanics -Good art work -Great soundtrack -Nice pallet of units  Cons: -Needs a bit more content -Interface needs some work -AI needs to be a bit better educated and more active and stop porposing crappy deals  Misc: -No nukes (Wish they explained why) -Not Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri -Want to see this universe expand  Notes:   -In my heart, this isn't a Alpha Centauri spiritual successor, it doesn't have the distrubing undertones, infact it is something else, it shows more of a hopeful future for mankind in the stars.  -Seriously people should really look at Civ V pre DLC, it had even less content than BE  -For recommendations about this game... For new to the genre or even the civilizations series, yes I do recommend it, but for us veteran players... Well, wait till there's DLC to beef up this game a bit, though it still can be enjoyable.",1
"Probably one of the best none-turn based strategy games out their. If you play games like Civilization and get lost for hours on end. Though only problem is endgame, where you can find yourself loosing planets and having to recolonize them every 15min. So unles you play multi-sysemt planets, you shouldn't see an issue. But those are the best parts.",1
dynamic fast paced shooter that needs teamwork,1
while i will never forget what they did with microtransactions in this game im happy they have removed most of that and i can enjoy this game again,1
this game absolutely the best horror game which i ever played.  made me frightened good graphics sound music weapons  don't play alone/10,1
its alright.,1

"A good game for passing the time, although the item selection in the game is limited, it is still easy to get to high levels with skill and sometimes a little luck. My only regret is that the gun upgrades take forever to get (The raygun isn't even that good)",1
"It's an alright game but when compared to the first game it lost a lot. Less puzzles, less encounters. Last is personal taste but the narrative is purposefully confusing to the point of being confusing.  PS: Pigs are fam animals,right?",-1
'Pass the whiskey',1
It's fun when you solo this game due to its small amount of enemies it gives out early game to get you ready for the big ones and having one friend or more will make it more exciting,1
"After a few hours of playing, I'm glad I bought this game. I am still very fond of Civ V, but the sixth game feels weird, functional and fresh. I would also gladly play the full price any time for the GODLIKE main menu music (Sogno di Volare - The Dream of Flight).",1
"So, it's a game about drifting. If you know how drifting works, just forget what you know for this game. It has such a huge learning curve. With that being said, I love it. It's so much fun to just go in and drive around. I finally completed it along with all the achievements and it's still fun to play. My only complaint is at times you lose the car behind a building or wall which makes it difficult at times to tell what is going on. Other than that, I would say get it if you are interested. I can only see the game getting better from here on.",1
great game would play 9/10,1
Payday 2 is very god (say god with danish accent)  you shoot pepl and lose money but you shoot polise you lose no money so ♥♥♥♥ the police i give 10/123 have a god (agian danish accent) time,1
"This is a game that instantly grabbed me and threw me into a space western.. The navel broadside fire secures this title as refreshing while rockin my socks off with a familiar midwestern flair. Stability was not an issue and the play is smooth. Choices abound enough to give a bit of elbow room in an expansive and finally challenging universe. It took a while to get to the point where I wasnt the worst disaster in these factions history. The variety of missions and emergency beacons make Rebel Galaxy a good ride.  Every now and then i get a hankering to rock out and shoot it out, so I load up my Barracuda. Thanks for a good ride.",1
At first I was upset with the actions and choices of the main character however that is because I was playing under the perception of innocence of the art style. The ending makes the game. The ending makes the game.   Gameplay is pretty straight foreward and it's not hard to know where you are suppose to go. I found it quite clever that the areas in the game where blocked off by real world objects like band-aides and stamps. The only issue with the game is that there is one rock in the graveyard where the outline flahses white.  Great game. Trigger Warnings though. Not much replay value but I would share it with friends.,1
Challenging and fun. Would reccomend picking it up. Even better is the multiplayer option.,1
Great Game.One of the most played games on Steam. Buy it.,1
"Fuuuuuuck this game will ♥♥♥♥ your brain so hard that after you beat the game, you will be diagnosed with mental retardation. Amazing scenery and very heartwarming mood. 9.5/10",1
"Its a great game,but it has flaws. Some that make the game very very irittating. Such as the save system which there is no way around. If you make a mistake or accidently hit the wrong option for something,thats it. You're stuck with it,and there is no going back. You can't reload a save because it saves automatically. It is extremely frustrating. Also,you can only have on save active at a time,so you can't have more than one profile or more than one person play the game on one account. If this game had a new save system,it would be almost perfect. That is the only thing I would change about this game,but it is one of the biggest features. If you are a patient person, or one who doesn't care about your game getting destroyed because of awful saves, this game is for you. But if you actual want a full experience and don't want to start over a whole new game from mission one when someone in your group dies or something bad happens because of a bad save, then I would not recommend this game at all.",-1
"The first thing that I noticed except for new graphics, sounds, enemies, items and other stuff is that compared to the original Isaac, this one is very fast-paced. No longer you need to wait for 2 seconds after picking up an item, trinket or simply going though a door. Moreover, the enemies, shots and Isaac himself seem to be faster.  Well, that's all for my first impressions. Now I understand why Bisnap said 'If you play Isaac: Rebirth, you won't want to go back to the original Isaac'. Thanks, Edmund!",1
"EVERYTHING is red, the missiles are red, the ENTIRE BACKGROUND IS RED, the enemies are all glowing red just like the reticles and the background and them issiles and EVERYTHING ELSE!  I CANNOT SEE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SHOOTING AT.   Oh did I mention that each 'mission' is 3+ parts long where you don't know how long you are going so if you so much as think about firing a few extra missiles or rockets just to make sure you will run out on the 3rd section AND THEN when you die/fail the mission and it respawns you at the last checkpoint the difficulty is increased noticeably.   2nd mission in and I'm like, I'm bored and fatigued from staring at the glowing red and trying to see what's going on.",-1

"5/10 It´s basically a game for people who want to 'experience' the thrill of a horror game without the scary in it. The story is great, but the gameplay just gets boring after an hour. Many things get repetitive and it ends with dissapointment. The idea is original but it could have been done better.",-1

"The people giving this game a lot of crap are the ones comparing this day 1 Civ 6 to perfected Civ 5 w/ all dlcs. This game is far and awy better than previous iterations. The AI may not be super smart right now but that's something that's likely to get fixed within the first month of release. The game runs amazingly well on Day and is an incredible 4X experience that has spiced up the middle game very well with eureka moments and districts. Don't let people fool you. This game is worth it's price and is easily the Best Civ game made to date. The fews flaws that exist will be patched out but if you had to choose between buying Civ 5 and Civ 6, get 6 because it is far more fleshed out and there are very few (if any) major features the games is lacking. If you want a game that is easy to invest hundreds of hours into, Civ 6 is your best choice.",1
"This game is so great! Seriously, it's so much fun and it translates extremely well to VR. For me, this the kind of game that has hours of replay value.   I really love being able to get up close and watch the action play out. Thank you for getting this together. great job!",1
"No pay win aspects in this game at all. It's just complete fun, I've almost essentially bought all the Dlc just because this game is simply fantastic. This is an essential game for anyone's library.",1
"I met a man once at a bus stop with a peculiar beard. He questioned my choice in clothing and when I looked down, i saw i had some majestic fur pants on. How the hell that happened, I still don't know, but that's roughly how I feel about buying this game. Fur pants forever dude. GOTY",1
"A brief note before I start is that I managed to not get any terrible performance issues, so my experience was much better than some.  Dishonored is one of my favourite games, and Arkane's sequel is, in my opinion, a worthy successor. Storywise, it sees you cast from Dunwall Tower by a witch claiming to be the rightful heir to the throne, and you venture to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos to learn how to kill this witch and retake the throne.   PROS - This game has an excellent atmosphere, with Karnaca being much more colourful than Dunwall, yet still just as dark behind the scenes. The city is overrun by a severe bloodfly infestation and the Grand Guard have been given free reign to make the lives of the citizens painful, and sometimes lethal.  -The lore is just as rich as the first game, with books galore to collect and read, and more to be found in conversation and audiographs.  -The heart has a much better way of telling you about the people of the world, and I often use it as the judge of whether or not a guard gets a blade in the neck.  -The voice actors for Corvo and Emily are great, as each will speak of the world in a different way, as Karnaca is Corvo's home, he sometimes reminices of his childhood in Serkonos, and Emily, having never left Dunwall talks in a bewilderment about how it differs to Dunwall.  -The combat is tight and responsive, and the addition of the reflex powers make it even more fun to murder unassuming guardsmen.  -Upgrading existing powers and Emily's new ones are all great to mess around with. Corvo is still as stupidly powerful as he was in the first game with Bend Time, and Emily's powers are also a force to be reckoned with, as Domino, Shadow Walk, Doppleganger and Mesmerise make it easy to carve people into bloody bits, or sneak through.  -Enemy AI is greatly improved, as officers have different attack patterns, but best of all... enemies can look up to see you above them, so it's not as easy to just crouch a head above someone and remain undetected.  -I found myself hating most of the people I was sent to kill just as much as the first game, save for Doctor Hypatia, as the rest are all vile people, who in the words of Samuel Beechworth, bless his soul 'deserve their fates more than anyone else'.  -The inclusions of Bonecharm crafting, more bonecharms and the extremely powerful Black Bonecharms gives more freedom of playstyle, though I'm sad that Strong Arms isn't as useful as it was in the first game.  -The inclusion of some Characters from the first game and it's DLC are great, and don't feel fan-servicey in the slightest, like Sokolov and *Not going to reveal because spoilers' and really do the game justice.  -A crack in the slab is one of the most memorable stand alone missions in recent memory, as the game pits you against a mansion, abandonned years ago, and over run by bloodflies, and cared for by their unfortunate Nest Keepers. The twist is that your powers are locked, and to successfully navigate the mansion, you must use a timepiece given to you by the outsider to move backwards and forwards in time, but in the past, you are in the midst of a heavily guarded Soirée. This makes for a great deal of pain, yet joy when you crack it without being seen. (I already beat the game without being detected)    CONS  -The widespread graphical issues, primarily frame drops can really take you out of the otherwise fantastically immersive world.  -The story doesn't make you figure much out for yourself, save for slowly letting you figure out the identity of *not revealing because spoilers* and most of the game's story is fed to you via expositionary speeches by Corvo and Emily at the start of each mission, and sometimes the two assassins will say things so stupidly obvious that it didn't deserve to be their.  -The difficulty doesn't really increase after Jindosh's Mansion (not counting 'A Crack in the Slab') as the Clockworks are the most threatening hostiles, but are rarely seen again after that mission.  -Having a perk to have the same effect on multiple bonecharms led me to assume that they could be stacked, but no. It's still understandable, as it would be silly tostack swift shadow four times and move faster in stealth than when sprinting.  -The payoff is slightly disappointing, but alas, DLC aho!  -THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF WHISKEY AND CIGARS ANYWHERE 0/10 TRASH GAME  As a fan of the first game I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first installment, HOWEVER, this is a tenative recommendation, as the performance issues could hinder your experience greatly, and if that's a turnoff for you, wait till Arkane have fixed it. ",1
"Hmm, this was a tough one to recommend. Why? There was so much to it that I found to be attributing to being boring. I had to look up how to achieve each route, and as I went through each, I realized that you don't make very many decisions at all. In fact, there is only like 6 major decisions (Depending on the previous decisions you have made) I like a visual novel where you make a lot of decisions, regardless of how much plot you have. Also, the characters felt very rigid with their movements and facial expressions a lot during the scenes where people were talking to each other in a non-special scene. It was just weird. Also, it may be just the fact that I am new to visual novels, but I felt that the pacing was very...slow. That could just be the fact that very few decisions were made, but still. Now, I did actually enjoy the hell out of this at times. I am semi-new to visual novels and gameplay, but a lot of times, this had very realistic scenes of the glider flying in the air, etc. The art was amazing, and I love animes and visual novels that strive to create vivid imagery and lighting. It was phenominal. For the sound, the music was fairly limited in its range, but the sound effects made were very well done, if you ask me. I would give this a solid 6/10, not because it is mediocre, but because there are a lot of elements to a game/visual novel that need to be adjusted in order to make the audience a bit more interested in the story, even with a good soundtrack, where this one had like 1 really good song. That was the opening song in the main menu. I wanted to seriously play this and be enthralled, and to some degree, I was.  *Don't be too harsh. I am new to making reviews on here*",1
"Never play this Genre before but I fall in love with it. You control 4 units. Each unit has its ability. Every Turn counts. Every corner matters. More detail in this game than I thought. You can upgrade your squads ( stats , gear , gun , skill ). A lot of mission. Would love if campagne available. I bought this game for 1$. Really worth a buy.   8.5/10 really worth a buy while on sale.",1
100 hours of my life well spent.,1
"Dude, I dunno.. This game is a good time killer, I guess... But it's broken... The Multiplayer feature is broken, most of the times server won't show up, even though there ARE servers.. There no clear way to make a server.. and that's a HUUUGE problem, because 99.9% of the game is MULTIPLAYER, and when that's broken... The Game is worthless..  There are so many things wrong with this game.. Basicly, the game is Broken, when It works, it's okay..... But it dosen't most of the times.",-1
"I played through the whole game, I loved it, Its beautiful, its mysterious, its fresh, its a lot of great things, and I would recommend it to anyone who was considering the game in the first place. If puzzles arent your thing, this game wont be. Its a puzzle game where the puzzle is as much of the problem as the solution itself. Its very creative and rewarding.  But there is something that doesnt sit well. The open world aspect, the lack of any narritive is cool, but also feels reduntant. The progression, the world, the exploration didnt really serve any real purpose. While the environment was beautiful, and did play a role in lots of the puzzles, it did feel like it was just a sudoku book of puzzles with the puzzles having been scattered around a world arbitrarily. The 'island' didnt really serve any purpose other than a backdrop, it could have easily have been a game done like Portal, where you move from room to room solving puzzles. The mysterious tone doesnt really reveal itself(unless it went over my head which it very well could have). A very minor minor thing I didnt like about the game, but I just wanted to point that out.",1
The Game overall is decent. I love managment games done right and this was no exception. The Cons of this game where very few for example. The combat style is based on a game of dice. And when I got punch club I also got the Dark Fist extension pak. But for some reason After going Pro I lost the content progrssion of it. The pros of the game is in the experiance. You choose your fighting style and how you want to progress. Yes it will feel Grindy during your Rookie and especially your Pro circut bouts but it's all worth it with the rich story and chalk full of refrences. The ending is spectacular and could definitly be a to-be-continued kind of ending. And I am hoping to get my hands on the next installment of Punch Club.,1
"This is probably one of my favourite games. The artstyle really appeals to me, and I think it's a beautiful game. The story is not overwhelmingly good, but it's most certainly enough to keep you playing. I don't think the story is bad, by any means. It just didn't blow me away.  It's a unique game. I've seen, and played, several stealth games before. But The Mark of The Ninja is probably my favourite. It's just so unique, and I love how there's so many ways to complete a level.  I think the playstyle and controls are great, I found no bugs at all throughout the entire game. The controls worked perfectly for me, and if I messed up in a level, I knew it was my own fault.  So to sum up:  Graphics: 10/10  Controls: 10/10 Story: 8/10",1

"Almost one year after release and we STILL have no buff for Chanka.   10/6 would Chanka again.

"This is a great puzzle game for those who like casual puzzle games. 26 different puzzles to play ranging from really easy to hard as balls.  There really isn't much to say, other than that the 26 puzzles are pretty damn fun, as are the daily puzzles that extend the playability of the game.  Honestly, $3 for almost 70 hours is just such a steal. This is an awesome game for anybody who likes casual puzzle games, and it's got quite a bit of content in it.",1
I imagine that it is a good game and i enjoyed the first game a lot.   However dishonerd 2 runs slower and looks worse than the first game. i'd recomend waiting for the game to be properly optimised.,-1

Great Puzzles and amazing plot. I Love it :D,1
"I really enjoyed this game as a counter-point to a shooter. After killing for 60 hours it was nice to give back and watch those poor nomads settle down and survive.   Bit of a steep learning curve at the beginning, but once you learn how to make it through the first year and get the basics covered you can expand pretty quickly and explore all the specialized jobs and mechanics. Once I got going the hours disappeared and I was invested in surviving winter.  ",1
"Really love this game. The graphics is amazing. But the game crashed 4 times in 30 min of play time. In other words, it's broken and unplayable.",-1
"I have to say, this is a very well thought out game! It keeps you at the edge of your set a lot of the time, with intense fights and chase scenes, but it also rewards you for that with satisfying loot and death animations. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that like a fast fast paced action game, with RPG elements!",1

"Excellent Stealth-Shooter. My biggest issue with it was the control-scheme. The controls aren't quite what you would expect from a shooter game. 'c' is crouch instead of 'ctrl', RMB is take cover, not aim down sights. It take some getting used to, and isn't as intuitive as it could be. Otherwise a great game. Story is excellent, and it pays homage to the other Deus Ex games while still going it's own direction. If you like cyberpunk, stealth, or shooters: this might be the game for you.",1
"An enjoyable casual game experience. A mix of bejeweled and RPG elements to try and top out and keeps your interest. Played through on iOS, as well, and found it much more enjoyable with the handheld version. The use of the mouse can be a bit cumbersome sliding rows/columns around. Looking for time to waste - this is your game.",1

"the most realistic mud ever exist in offroad franchise.  but wait. this isn't about racing or time trial or competing against something, but it is about how long you could survive offroad driving, deep in the middle of (maybe) Russian forest alike.  with a described objective, you are instructed (or not) to find a shortest (tentative) route to the main objective with a specified task.  maybe this is the game for an offroad die-hard fans.  cons:   - no casual gaming - maybe it need a real off-road driving techniques to master this game - unfinished features (car attachement, variety of task, etc) - need more gameplay development  pros:  + hardcore offroad driver should buy it + close enough to the real offroad driving techniques + realistic mud and water (the best so far) + awesome physics + sandboxes are great! cool environment! + haven't try multiplayer yet, i guess it'll be great + you dont have to spend $15000++ for a real offroad car and pay the landlord for your driving issues  i bought it at $29.99 and it is worth it",1

"Disclaimer: This game makes me nauseous. I've tried altering the settings, and I've managed to play a total of 15 minutes in two sessions. This is my impression on those 15 minutes. The remaining time I have logged is just dead time to get cards.  It is certainly atmospheric. That is really its strongest point, and if you want nothing but a creepy game look no further. The whole asthetic is certainly cohesive, which makes me wish the art design was too. What I experienced of 'level' design was (mostly) competent though not compelling.   The story and premise unfolds too gradually; the first two levels have zero context. Even after that I often found myself looking at things and thinking 'Why does this matter?' My main gripe however is I found the controls clunky; it's not the best sign when your player gets immediately lost without you putting immpersion-breaking icons over everything.

It is F2P so there are microtransactions (which can be on the expensive side!) but very few non-cosmetic items are purchase-only. Essentially, you can play all of the content of this game without paying a cent.

"I got a refund Always on-line DRM The game does say it just needs steam cloud enabled but it will not launch in offline mode of steam at all thus requireing online at all times.  Also, I couldnt play the game as I had graphical errors that made it literally unplayable and unable to see what was going on. The cutsences played fine for only 50% of the screen and in game looked like a strobe of horizontal bars with the UI and subtitle overlays working fine. Even the pause screen worked fine with no issues.  So with not being able to ever play this offline combined with spending an hour trying to fix the graphical issues i just got a refund instead. If i can run the latest DMC game i should be able to run this.  EDIT: Not changing my review because they fixed some stuff later on, once a review is posted your done son.... That being said apparently they fixed the AMD 4800 graphical issue and 'supposedly' removed online only DRM so it can start in offline mode. But this should of not been an issue in the first place so review stands.",-1

Can be a good game but sometimes you get noob teamates who take all the ammo :P,1
So much for Twisted metal! I really enjoy playing this the graphics are amazing the gameplay is flawless and most of all the controls are fabolous. First of all I will admit that I was skeptical at first on buying this because I didn't know what to expect. Thank goodness they had a option for a demo and I gave it a go and just simply loved it.   Everyone has different taste but this was well worth the 50% off sales event.,1

"The graphic style of this game really snagged my interest, and was something I felt I hadn't seen in awhile. It felt nostalgic yet new. Like a lonely road, picking at what treasures I could and hazily watching the horizion. Just feels like there is so much in it. A shame it's so short! The story really intrigued me, and the 'aha!' moments were wonderful.  Definately loved this game, just sad that it wasn't all that long!   Would actually love to know more about the world it's set in, or get to go on more adventures in it's setting!",1
AWSOME GAME EXCEPT that is kiked me during preloaders and got an 30 min abandon ,1
"I owe a lot of thanks to Creative Assembly for making the Total War Series. I have spent weeks of my life playing these games and loved every minute of it. The original Rome total war in particular was a masterpiece  Empires was a bit of a dissapointment because of bad design choices and bugs which were mostly eventually addressed but it was hard to fault CA since the game was extremely ambitious and you felt they simply bit off more than they could chew.  Shogun 2 goes a different way by deciding to bring a smaller experience(Japan compared to half the world) with very polished gameplay. Battles involving thousands of units happen very smoothly and there is some real tension and sense of accomplishment when you find yourself hopelessly outnumbered and find a way to win.   The only negative to this game is that it can be quite hard at first, unfairly so. For example if you are winning, the Shogun will make all other factions declare war on you all at once. Other than that, I will say that this game is a must buy for fans of the strategy genre",1
"Hey, it's fun!",1
"Awesome, impressing - worth every minute!!",1
"Ever since it's announcement since last year's E3, I've been looking forward to it. Every piece of footage they've shown since then has gotten me even more hyped for it. When they said they were holding review copies until release, even I was scared. Scared but hopeful. I've been playing the original doom games since i was young, they're some of the finest games ever made, and I was hoping so much that this would be good.  Then it came out.  And it's completely blown me away  I'm incredibly happy with this game. I've been wanting a game like this for a long time, and finally, i've gotten an amazing one. It's just demons, guns, gore, and a good bit of story for those interested  The single player is undoubtable the main selling point of the game, and best part of the experience. It alone is well worth the price of admission. With a length of around 10-16 hours for your first playthrough, not a single moment was boring. Every second of this game is exhilerating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Weapons are satisfying to shoot, enemies are satisfying to kill, even the pre-canned execution animations are so fast they don't break up the pace of the game at all.  This game makes you feel POWERFUL, but soft. You can ♥♥♥♥ up enemies in record times with powerful weaponry, but on harder difficulties you are also quite squishy yourself, which combined with the speed of the game makes an extremely skill-based experience (A quick note, the game feels a lot faster with a high FOV. It's not super slow at 90, by any means, but at 130, you rEALLY feel the rush of moving extra fast, and it makes it more enjoyable). The weapon attachments are a nice touch to the game, along with the armor upgrades, adds for a bit of nice progression through the story, that can be completely ignored if you want of course. The enemy types from the originals are all there too, colorful and with great silouhettes and sound effects that let you know what you're going up against. They all have a really nice redesign, but elements of the original design are kept, that make many of them instantly recognizable as the classic demons you know and love. They have excellent AI too, they don't all just run at you blindly, they all act differently, be they an imp, running away and grabbing walls to line up a good shot, or a hell knight, relentlessly hounding you and attempting to beat your face in. They're all expertly designed to make you prioritize targets and make the senseless ripping and tearing a bit more strategic. The music is absolutely amazing too. It's not quite as memorable a soundtrack as the original's, but it's a fantastic mix of metal and electronic, that's brutal as hell and ABSOLUTELY matches up with everything that's going on onscreen. The boss fights, the few there are, are reALLY GOOD. They could be a bit harder, but I'm willing to bet they'll be harder to deal with in Nightmare (of which, i played ultra violence). But they're all really cool, with multiple attacks and the works. They're ABSOLUTELY good boss fights, and are very fun to fight, but there are some ways they could've been improved upon to make them even better. Though even with that, they're the best boss fights in the entire series.  The lore, what little there is, is actually very interesting to me. It's by no means extensive, but as a fan of being able to read up on lore of doom 3, the little bit of reading there is to do for every monster in this game satisfied me greatly. A little bit of context and story is good enough for me. The characters are nearly as intriguing as the demons, and i loooove reading up on the demons. The doomguy himself is given an interesting backstory, but doesn't talk, and through just his body language you can get more character from him than most big budget ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t exposition machines. Besides that, there are VERY FEW story sequences which lock you in rooms and require you to listen to exposition. And the few there are are pretty much all within the first few levels of the game, so it's not all that bad.  There are secrets too, you're rewarded with health, ammo, and even some classic doom levels you can mess around in, like in wolfenstein.   I think i've gotten through everything good I wanted to say, so now onto some of the bad things (what few there are). For one, there are a few graphical and audio glitches here and there. Every now and then it's easy to run into a physics glitch where a body will get stuck in the geometry and make some noise. but these aren't very bad, and barely hinder the game's experience, if at all. The bosses I enjoyed fighting, but theres one boss that I'm legitimately surprised they left out. I was almost certain they'd have the icon of sin in as an actual boss. I know it was just a wall in doom 2, but with what they did with the other bosses, I'm sure they could've found a way to make a modern icon of sin fight. A damn good one at that. But it only shows up as an environmental thing near the end of the game, though honestly with an extremely amusing easter egg attached to it. This also feeds into how I feel the boss fights could've been improved overall. They're GREAT, and absolutely fun, but each one is just in a circular fighting arena, and i feel like they could've been improved if lengthened, and put in bigger areas that allow for more running around, perhaps mixed with some regular enemies as well. They also don't have the arachnotrons anymore, though in the end I still had 2 slots in the beastiary empty, so I don't know if or how I missed 2 enemy types, but i doubt they'd be arachnotrons. The level design is great, the arenas and everything are well made and fun to run around in, but it plays a bit in that respect like a serious sam game, where you run through halls with little enemies in them and then the big baddies come out in big fights, which some people may not be a fan of, but I personally feel it matches what this game's going for and works well. But as the game progresses, the level design falters a little bit. They're by no means just infinite straight hallways like other modern fps games, they have secrets and damn good design in general, but they do feel a little linear in that most of the time you do just have a single path open, to which you get a key and then have just 1 more path, and so on and so forth. I definately remember levels like this in the old games, and it isn't quite as bad as doom 3, but I do feel the levels could've had more open levels later on. I also aren't a huge fan of the gauss cannon and the weapon modifications. They're nice, and don't ruin the experience or anything, but i feel like they can get extremely overpowered, especially the gauss cannon, which quite frankly, is a nice weapon, but is so ♥♥♥♥ing over powered i'd rather it just not be in the game at all. The chainsaw is cool, with limited ammo, and giving you ammo drops when you kill enemies, but playing on ultra violence i never really needed it (Though I plan on playing the game through again on Nightmare without any mods or upgrades, so hopefully it'll be more useful there). The bfg having such limited ammo is good too. It's incredibly powerful, to the point where I never wanted to use it though, as it would make things simply too easy. Though again, all of the upgrades and everything is optional, that's why I'm choosing to not use them in the next playthrough.  Now onto the multiplayer and snapmap, of which there isn't much to say really Multiplayer is a bit of fun, but mediocre, not well balanced (due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t loadouts lmao), and mostly meh. It's a bit of fun here and there but it's probably going to be dead soon so. The snapmap is a harmless addition, it's fun to play around with but lacks the depth to make really good maps. They really should allow better modding   Overall, doom is FANTASTIC. I loved it from start to finish An easy 9/10 for the single player alone  Rip  And  Tear",1
"this game was very funny until it crashed and all my data just disappeared, i was level 19 with alot of thing unlocked and after the crash,nothing! they seriously need to fix the bugs",-1
I was hyped af for this game. Was not disappointed. 11/10,1

"Great old school 8 bit game to relieve games like phantasy star from 'back in the day'. Turn based, no grinding required, fantasy story with a bit of humor.",1
Of course Max Payne 3 is a great game. If you have homicidal tendencies and don't want to serve jail time go kill some NPCs! Bullet time is back and better and who doesn't want to pop pills!? It's an awesome way to kill time...and people.,1
"I bought this because I've been a huge fan of the recent Tell Tale games and all I can say about this game is that's it's boring. I've given it multiple tried and every time I get bored rather quickly. I can't point to what specifically makes it boring, it just isn't compelling.",-1
"SO...how should i begin..i made a review bout this game earlier..before the 1.1 update came out.. (now we have 1.2...something...) soo...many new items werea dded wich are awesome..biomes are just GREAT..my favorite one is the crimson one...uuuuuuuuuuuuh..yea...what to say...the game got so awesome..it brought my interrest back now the game just needs..vehicles like planes or choppers..or whatever,,,then its perfect...or portals and a moon biome then...the perfect game is born.maybe even more bosses like a uuh...giant walking tree...not a morning wood but..a GIANt tree boss..i dont like the uuuh....how to say?..wave bosses...like santank or ice princess thingy whatever shes called,,,it needs classic bosses..like maybe a spaceship or a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig robot or a iron avatar n stuff...i beg the makers of the game (redigit) to ..keep working on this game..please make the community happy again with a new big update ;P this update was enought but there are still so many ways o make this game more awesome.",1
"Never played such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that is so fun. If you have friends that like cars and driving around then you are in for fun. Roadtripping is amazing and will provide a joyful experience; and there sure as hell is enough map space. I've now owned this on PS4 (Lvl 50) and PC (Lvl 10) and still enjoy just driving around. This game is enhanced if you have a wheel but there is a steep learning curve in setting one up. Car customization is fun but is no Forza. I will reccomend this game simply because I find it joyous to just drive around. Oh and btw Highway child makes a s h i t ton of money and I suggest playing it, but you will ♥♥♥♥ing hate it quickly, god that race makes me want to end it all.  Pro's: HUGE map fun with friends The Summit Drifting Racetracks Race cars Customization Random events The cars  Cons:  Random events  The cars (How long does it take to add a damn R35?!?!?) Barricade Rocketship (You'll know what im talking about) Numerous glitches (AC Unity bad in some parts) Sometimes the map will just disappear Highway child (♥♥♥ YOU MERCEDES I HIT ONE BARRIER AND NOW THE DEFACIT IS 4 MILES) EXPENSIVE ♥♥♥ CARS AND NOOO WAY TO GET MONEY.   ♥♥♥♥ this i'm just going to buy the Koenigsegg. (273 Fullstock).       10/10 Fiat Abarth Monster Truck",1
"The game looks great, but there is a lot of pop-in textures; even with updated drivers. The game will be better if you take the time to admire the artistic direction of the developers. The AI is a mixed bag ranging from dumb as rocks to not half bad sometimes. The towns and wastelands are to small and lack any real personality. If you buy this game be sure you complete everything you want to do BEFORE the final mission. The developers did not include free roam after you finish the game. As for the sewers DLC, don't bother unless it's free.",1
"This game has great potential to be one of the most fun and tactical games for a very long time. BUT, it has a long way before it can be called a 'good game.' Problems like hit reg, peekers advantage, matchmaking, glare... those are just a few of the things that NEED to be fixed before this game is a 'good game.' When these bugs/glitches are fixed this game has the potential to be as big and as great as CSGO",1
"Reading the reviews i couldn't help but see hundreds of negative reviews just because of the micro transactions. I myself also think its rediculous that they are in a singleplayer non competitive game, though i find it rediculous that people are condeming an amazing game over it.   This game is not pay to win, its completely optional to buy the money or praxis points. I found myself with almost all augs in the game without buying any of the microtrans and im around the halfway point.  The game itself is amazing and better then Human revolution, the leveling feels natural, and the story is captivating.  I would highly recommend this game to people who loved Human Revolution.",1
"Solid game. I'm disappointed they didn't polish it up a bit more before launch, but overall its an enjoyable experience and one that I've put a lot of time into. Just make sure your PC can run it smoothly.",1
"I went through 'phases' with this game. Anywhere between asking myself 'Am I enjoying the game?' to 'This game is incredible!'  The game feels like a illegitimate sexy love child of Batman (Arkham Asylum etc) and Assassin's Creed. The combat is Batman The exploration and 'towers' are very Assassin's Creed - The ranger man even has his own version of 'Eagle Vision'.  The game can be quite memorable, mostly due to the Orc Captains / Warchiefs. Each time you encounter one (If you don't one shot it) greets you in his own way. No two Orc captains / warchiefs are the same - At least I never came across two who looked identical, and I killed quite a few of them.  Occasionally an Orc will, by some super evil magic, somehow come back to life, even if you decapitated the damn thing. He will remember your last encounter and make some snide comment to you and threaten your life.  My only complaint about the same is regarding the 'ganging' up of the Orc captains / warchiefs. On occasions (far too many to count) I was met by 3-4 captains at a time. This isn't really much a big deal, sure they could potentially kill you, especially if they're crossbow using ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The main concern with this was that if one attempted to flee you were met with a choice - Persure the fleeing one and let the other two get away, or let him flee and try to kill the other two.  Either scenario lets an Orc or Orcs get away, become more powerful and potentially become resistant to more types of attack, which, in turn, could lead to an Orc immune to almost everything.  All in all I would give this game a Saurons Mouth out of 10.",1
"I wish this game at least copied zelda stuff better.  War is a really boring character, and the game itself is aesthetically pleasing but kind of boring.",1
Nice game!,1
It's a great game! The music just adds th the addictiveness!,1
Buying this game is like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a dumpster.  It stinks and you regret the decision immediately.,-1
"Probably the best melee simulation, that exists currently. If that appeals to you, this is the game for you!",1
"You have to let it grow on you. There are some bugs that need working out, and I'm only hoping this is in Alpha/Beta. Scruvy/Force feeding Can really mess your captain or crew over. Other than that it is enjoyable, just need to learn how to build your crew. It's trail and error. Start can be VERY rough. They need to implament some sort of higher HP regen when out of battle for awhile, or at a tavern. Other than that it's a fun game",1
great and unique gameplay.. it is a shame they couldn't make more,1
"After reading all the negative reviews I wouldn't agree with most of them. This game is beyond addicting and a lot of fun. You will enjoy this game a lot if you are a hardcore pvp player even if you solo. If you like hardcore pvp this is the game for you... you will die a lot but it gets better as it goes on. If you don't like hardcore pvp and are a casual player then do not buy the game. We all know its the devs from WarZ and ISS with their bad reputation, but this game is actually amazing and there are literally no cheaters running around because they all get banned. I have almost 200 hours from beta alone and I have never ran into a cheater. Their anti-cheat is on point so far and I hope it continues to be. There are two downsides to this game one is being that you will need to most likely buy gold edition or better because you will need the vault slots and it also gives you xp, but they just patched the requirements for levels of guns you can use and lowered it so you only need level 20 to run around with a legendary. The other downside is that you will die a lot regardles of what you do.. just keep playing and you will get better and stay alive a lot more. I 100% recommend this game to anyone that likes pvp. I really hope the devs keep up with how their working on the game now and if they do this game will succeed. They patch the game really often and fixed a lot of bugs and change a lot of different things by listening to the community. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who likes pvp games.. the pvp is amazing.",1
"He would be potentially a perfect game. It has only two BIG problems. Bad, really bad, matchmaking, that make the life really difficult for new players, and, above all, the f***ing Premium. Above all for customization, Premiums have too many advantages against Free to players. And now with this game on Console, on PC it will be abandoned.",1
"Its not perfect. Civ V wasn't either. This game is 10x better than V was at launch. I have neverending confidence that it will be added to, iterated upon, and improved in the coming years to make it the best Civ game ever.",1
Awesome game because it's free.,1
"Korean MMO Simlator 2015  Overall Trove, for me atleast is quite unsatisfactory. Solo play is quite fun at times but most of the time makes you want to get friends. However with friends trove turns into something in the background and isactually quite enjoyable.  I'd say when you have to make the leap from U1 to U2, don't give up because U2 unlocks shadow tower and thats pretty fun.  Ahh, another useless review",1
"Halo with dinosaurs, best $0.10 I've ever spent.  10/10 would get eaten by a Deinosuchus again.",1

Best in the world!  Workshop is full of cool trucks. Don't forget to download and install spintires plus. Free at spintires . nl Also free custom maps can be found at spintires . nl  Installing maps is as simple as dragging two files out of a .rar file to spintires level folder.,1

Freaking awesome classic game,1
Trove is a good game its not the best but its ok and I play it a lot but still I think that Its a good not the best but good. I would recommend this game but not for hard core gamers if you are than I would recommend GTA 5 or if your a bit young for that I would say This or Minecraft.,1
"Always been a TR fan, but this is the first title I actually finished 100%. Must have for any TR fan. The game does a great job of pulling you into the game. The whole survival aspect is intense.  Pros: Breaktaking graphics Upgradable weapons Finishing Moves Intense combat Achievements Collectables Auto-adjusting camera You can hunt crows, rat and bunnies for salvage.  Cons: Not a fan of button mashing, but it's not heavily overused Mobs do respawn, so be careful if fast traveling to a previous campsite, you could run into a group of baddies in an area you thought was cleared.",1
7.5/10,1
Sometimes I come back to this game just because it is too good to not forget :D,1
"Good game to play with friends now and then for a few matches. Gameplay runs well, not much to complain about. Not the greatest game and definitly not the worst. Just a good, simple, game!",1
"Highly addictive and very complex. I don't remember when was the last time I had so much fun playing a game. The only back side is it crashes randomly literally every 20 minutes of gameplay on my system, so i have to rely on autosaves.",1
Game is great. Just need to get past the online issues that plague all launch days,1
Garry's Mod is well worth the very low price. I have exactly 907 hours and I can say I still enjoy playing it time to time.,1
"Insurgency has one of the most authentic FPS experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The authenticity of this game is due to HUD realism (no radar, no hit markers), sound realism (let's just say you'll understand why people are hiding behind cover when you hear the bullets whizzing by), weapon feel and control, and loadout customization. The variety of guns, maps, and modes lend to its replayability. The AI in this game is probably the best I've seen so far, sometimes rivaling the skill of real players. The game supports the Steam Workshop where you can find some of the best maps, gun mods, and audio packs that really spice up the experience. One of the biggest personal selling points is the dedication and passion that the developers show for this game. Since release, they've released huge free content updates that include new maps, weapons, gameplay updates, and most recently, Linux support.  +Authentic experience +Loadout customization +Night mode +Great AI +Free content updates +Steam Workshop support +Linux support +Achievements +Trading Cards   No cons.",1
"lame story, gameplay gets boring after 30min. worth $2 tops",-1
"This game is just soooooooooo good. I bought it months ago and i wasn't disapointed back then, and i'm still not disappointed. The game just basicaly gets better every update. I love it so much 10/10",1
"Cool killcams and offers options to play with realistic bullet physics. Great sniping segments. Unfortunately a pretty repetitive game with clunky controls and gameplay outside of those segments. This game personally doesn't do it for me, but other people might find more enjoyment out of it. I would recommend buying it when it's on sale.",1
I'm usually very against killing spiders because they're lovable fuzzies that need to be cherished and protected for eternity. No matter how big or murderous.   But this is a really really good game. Can feel grindy at parts/tedious. But overall great fun. Especially with friendo's who can help you shoot the things and ride bikes at very high speeds while you try your hardest to aim a red line of ♥♥♥♥ at some hectors.,1
"For someone who has never played any other MGS game, MGSV is a nice stelth action game that looks pretty good and plays pretty well.   It could have ended better though.",1
"This game is simply amazing. It's easy to learn, but very hard to master.",1
Ive played 35 hours in total in the five days ive had this :L,1
Wonderful new installment in the series. Lots of new changes and hours (years) of fun to be had. 10/10,1

"I watched tons of videos back in mid 2014 about this game and got addicted, 2 years later and still as addicted as I was when I got the game. I've been through so many updates ever since 2014 and they're only getting better, I'm really proud of SCS for making such an addicting game. It's relaxing, yet concentrating to make sure nothing goes wrong on the road. Everyone compares this simulator to other driving simulators and nothing can actually beat it. I highly recommend this game for a chill time and fun while your at it. While it says I have 326.7 hrs on record (as of today) I have well accounted up to 1000+ hrs on other comupters, while this is my new computer.  Pros: - The most realistic simulator out, from the way the engine starts or fails to start, to realistic fuel consumption and air brakes simulatiom (only naming a few) - Graphics are stunning especially on my current pc, everything ultra. - AI cars end up in realistic situations and accidents do happen, while this may be 'stupid', it definately simulates situations happening in the real world - Branded trucks and unique real sounds adn textures for every truck just adds to the feel of the game - Much more but I'm running out of time!  While every game isn't perfect so isn't this one. Cons:  - Graphics engine does feel outdated with unusual times where the frames drop yet there is hardly anything spawned (they especially drop in heavy cities and with AI cars bunching up) - This game especially screen tears when I don't use vsync, other games can go much more above my refresh rate, doesn't have a problem with keeping up - Using DX9 is outdated and isn't supported with use of my f.lux application (if you don't know what that is, it is a yellow layer on top of my screen to keep blue light away from me at night) this results in me having to play in windowed mode so I don't get the full widescreen 1080p experience  While these are only minor cons, it doesn't interfere with the whole realistic experience and it only keeps on getting better.  Don't be fooled by ther developers, who promise updating and never do, you can always trust SCS, if you downlaod an old version of ETS and then download the current one, you'll see how far they've come from new physics, new trucks and map expansions, you'll wonder why you aren't even playing Euro Truck, I don't know what your waiting for, just buy it and see for yourself!",1
"I don't usually review games but I was suprised to see that this game played fine on my PC (I built it less than a month ago, so that might be why). I received the game for free after purchasing my 970, not really my genre of games to be honest.  After modifying the ini file I get around 60 fps during gameplay and cutscenes. Even when driving the batmobile I get around 50 fps.  Intel I5-4690K MSI GTX 970 Asus Sabertooth Z97 Mark I Motherboard 16 GB RAM EVGA GS 850W Power Supply 2TB Western Digital HDD  Windows 10 Insider Edition with DirectX 12 (this could be a major factor in the game's smoothness and fps)  That being said, it seems to be poorly optimized for anything other than mid to high builds. I wouldn't trust it on lower specs. If you can run it, the game seems to be fun so far, other than batman having horrendous voice acting.",-1
Well worth the money,1
"Insurgency is an amazing game that blends the one-life CS:GO formula with less arcadey, more tactical, teamwork based gameplay with realistic elements seen in shooters like ARMA. If you're looking for a more realistic and tense First Person Shooter, Insurgency delivers this amazingly well without being a full blown simulator. It perfectly compromises realism and gameplay into one addicting experience.   PROS  - Great graphics. The game has very good visuals, whether it be a large desert area with few buildings and abandoned humvees, to multiple indoor areas such as markets, a ministry, and more. The gun models and textures are all decent as well.  - Sound design. The soundtrack itself is very good. It fits the mood of the game and especially in tense moments, when you turn the tide of the match, to even defeat. It captures these themes fairly well. However, where the sound design really excels is its attention to detail. From immersive suppressive gunfire sounds that seem to ping right above your head to footsteps of a rebel approaching your corner, it really puts you into the firefight.  - Gunplay. I haven't had such satisfying gunplay since the classic PAYDAY 2 days, which is impressive. Insurgency really puts a lot of research and details into making their weaponry faithful and pretty realistic too. The guns feel nice and they're a blast to fire. Even though some guns serve more or less the same purpose, they still feel and look different, which is a welcome change. Popping enemies and scoring headshots is really satisfying despite there being no hitmarkers in this game.  - Lots of game types. Insurgency has a healthy variety of game types, so you won't get bored easily. There's Checkpoint, Conquer, Survival, and more. Other than PvP there is also a PvE Co-Op, which also has multiple gametypes. You could easily play only the PvP aspect of Insurgency or just the Co-Op aspect of Insurgency and still get many hours out of the game.  - Good selection of maps. There's a lot of different settings in this game, even if most of them take place in a desert. Other than that, each map feels different, with different vantage points, cover, and more. There's smaller, indoor maps to sprawling, Battlefield esque maps like Buhriz with very open areas. - Point system. There's a pretty nice point system that is similar to the CS:GO system where you buy weapons and armor, but instead of money you use a permanent supply of points. For example, you'll start off with 5 points, with your gun being one point, attachments and extra armor being another. This adds a level of customization and various 'builds' of gear within different classes.  - Modding/workshop. There is a very active modding and workshop community in Insurgency. Whether it be drastically different gun models, attachments, sound packs, or even complete reworks of the game that you can play in custom servers. It strays away from the cancerous microtransactions (looking at you CS:GO and PAYDAY 2) and instead allows you to endlessly customize with no limit...and it's free.  - Community. Now this might be a surprise. An Online modern and fairly popular FPS not having a completely cancerous community? Yes, that's right. Now, of course you'll run into the eventuall troll, mic spammer, and the guy who keeps saying 'Allahu Ackbar' trying really hard to be funny, but other than that most of the community is very cooperative. I've met many friendly players across multiple servers and game modes.    CONS  - There really isn't much to say bad about this game. It's that good. There are a small amount of bugs and every blue moon your game might crash, but it's understandable since it's a smaller team working on this game. Also if you alt tab from games a lot this game does take forever to tab back in, but these are nitpicks.   NEUTRAL  - Minimalistic HUD. Personally I love this HUD since it not only fits the realistic feel of the game and removes the clutter, and it looks nice too. But it's up for the player if they like this type of HUD or not.  - No single player. This isn't a single player/story driven game. There's a short tutorial that acts as an introduction but there's not much more than that. If you're looking for a big story or narrative you should search somewhere else. The fun in this game is found in the multiplayer.  - Realistic elements and gameplay. This isn't CS:GO or Call of Duty. It's more like Battlefield and ARMA combined with the life system of CS:GO. A stray bullet can and will end your life even if you have a helmet and extra armor. This game requires more of your attention, teamwork, and slower tactical gameplay. You can't run and gun the same like in other shooters. So again, if you're looking for arcadey gameplay like that, look somewhere else.  Overall, Insurgency is an excellent game. It has constant free updates, bug fixes, and the game itself is only $15, which it itself is a huge steal. Even then this game goes on sale pretty often, so you really get your bang for your buck here. Considering all the factor's I've mentioned, the price, and the developers' work ethics, I'd give this game a full 10/10. I highly recommend this game for almost every military FPS fan.",1

"I'm mad. What the hell is with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'microtransactions', uninstalled. -  'We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)'  ha,  Ha,  HA.  - Love your salty Payday Community. ',:^)",-1

this game is fun and challenging. keeps you wanting to solve the puzzle. fair puzzles but gets hard. Only issue is if you suffer from getting dizzy on FPS's then this will have the same effect. i found myself having to stop oftewn as it was making me sick.,1

"What can I say... That this game is unlike any other card game ever made! The art is absolutely stunning! You don't have to buy anything from the store, unless you're desprate, you can just save up spirit orbs. The gameplay is just, so unique that it makes me want to cry that it's finaly not a cliche and not a 50% Hearthstone copy. This game sets a whole new level of impressiveness. I can't just describe in a paragraph, guys! It's just that good! It's like TCG meets pixel games and they had a baby. If you love TCG and the classic pixel games, then this one is a must have for you! It's beautiful, amazing, and just the best that I have ever seen! If you want a good head start, here is my refer code that will give you 100 gold: zenneth  I hope to see you all in the game! &lt;3",1
"Map is very big, great visuals, awesome gameplay. Buy this game!",1
"I love this game. It has great fighting mechanics and everything you do in the game just feels so meaty. Jason is an absolute ♥♥♥♥in badass. The online is absolutely terrible because no one plays it. Unless you have a friend that lives near you and has a good ping, don't buy this game expecting to have a fun time playing online. Playing with a friend right next to you on one TV makes for one of the best gaming expereinces.",1
♥♥♥♥ Data Realms for releasing this and claiming it was 'finished',1

"Fantastic atmosphere unlike any other game (I'm a winter person) But the levels are both recycled and repetitive, the music could be better as it tries to force a spooked attitude on you when it's not really scary at all.   Controlling the mech is HELLA FUN!",1
The game was awesome but the controls and the voice acting ... that was the bad part. Would recommend 8/10.,1
love this game i just need to get a steering wheel now so i can play it soem more buy this game its great,1
"7/10 Good game, but crashes alot.",-1
Cute game.,1
"After playing every Civ game growing up, I feel that Civ V while a bit different, was very enjoyable.",1
"A little difficult to get in to, the voice acting is abit wooden and the tutorial is awfull. However It is a fun game the combat is great and the skyboxes are beautiful. You wont get bored easily there is plenty to do alongside the games main story mission and the ship and equipment customisation is extensive. I think it's worth a try if you like space sim/shooter games.",1
"Its a good job i got this game cheap or i would be mega anonyed. the fact that theres about 4 hours of my life i will never get back , it not realy a gmae just a story will only 1 chose in the whole thing , the images are or but there not as hardcore as you might be looking for . dissapoting all round",-1
"Please do not support the developers of this game. It is unplayable at release, just as bad as before. If you are interested in games similar to this, go check out Planet Coaster.",-1
"The mouse isn't locked onto the window if you play it in windowed mode. Aiming and shooting if pretty much impossible, and the optimization is pretty terrible. Trying to play below 1920x1080 in fullscreen jacks the home screen up, so thia game isn't even worth it if YOU get paid for playing it. It also looks like it was made by giving a toddler Unity. gg. 1.5/10",-1
"Dragon Age: Origins is one of my most favorite games of all times. I absolutely love the lore and the characters, I wholly recommend this game and the sales usually make this game a steal! Pick it up ASAP... but only if you like amazing games.",1
"Where to start? Mechanically, the game is adequate. It looks alright, performs well enough (although not great), and most things work as expected. From here, things go down hill.  The story starts out non-existent and ends somewhere between there and non-sensical. The game jumps all over the place (literally), and the story makes pretty much no sense (even after the credits roll).  There was not a single point in the game where I felt like it was a 'horror' game, and most of the attempts at horror just come off as cheesey schlock. 'Survival' is another tag attached to this game, and I think that's also a bit of a stretch.  The above would all be forgivable if the rest of the game was actually fun, though. There are good moments in the game, but there are also a slew of awful moments in between those far too rare good ones. Checkpoints are sporadic, as is the difficulty. So you'll go through entire chapters with a save every 5 minutes and never be in danger, and on another level you'll end up replaying a 20 minute section over and over because of a (literally) randomly spawning enemy that instagibs you if he touches you. Fun.  Overall, I would not recommend this game. There are so many other games that this one is trying to emulate that do it better. Go play Dead Space instead.",-1
Great Game. :),1
This game is definately what the Alien game franchise has been waiting for!! Right from the begining its full of suspense and will have you creeping around and scared of the shadows! Absolute awesome game!!,1
Rocket League is life! If you never played this game before then buy it if u like competetive games! And please if you play the game dont look Jhzer because u suck then in competetive! Steam Sale buy it now or never :3,1
Uninstallation Simulator 2015!,1
I can't close this game! Don't take it the wrong way this is not because I like it it's because the game messed up my steam to the point I can no longer log out or delete this monstrosity that these devs call a game,-1
You can make pokemon decks and play them. Thats pretty awesome.,1
"9/10  Great game only reason its not 10/10 is because if you don't have any friends online it gets a bit dull, but if you don't have any friends online you can always post a thread on steam to ask people if they want to play. The game itself has mobs everywhere a wide arstnal of weapons. Tons of bosses and events where mobs swarm you. Mobs sometimes drop loot some loot is rare and some loot is common.",1
Yes. This game is great but it can use a bit of refinement. But still there is only so much you can do with source engine. Could have a bit smoother gunplay since at the moment it feels a little clunky. 9/10!,1
"It's fun the first couple of hours, but the limited options quickly makes the gimmick boring. But i feel it's with the 10€ for a few hours of fun entertainment",1

IT WONT EVEN OPEN!!!!!,-1
"Awesome game. You are playing as a single soldier (American) who is often trying to flank or snipe down the enemies using his favourite sniper rifle but in many cases uses different gunpower to eliminate the objects. This is just another of those good games you will progress hardly through enemy lines. One thing that annoys me a lot are the hints that pop up all the time throughout first mission. So far I got to second great mission. One mission consists of parts, so if you use all your medkits, bombs or ammo for machine gun, be sure next level you have spent them and you need to look for another resources from that soldiers, but at the beginning of each session you get some ammo.",1
Great game!!,1
Suprisingly more enjoyable then i thought it would be. Between the cute animal girls you fight and the catchy music it is worth a try. Granted at later levels i found myself focusing more on making sure i got out enough DPS to win and constantly hunting for the gold sprites.,1
'Units can you please shoot the native americans scalping you from the flank? Maybe stab them or something? No?' And then I lost,-1
"This game is a bit of a strange experience for me. I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.  So it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like 'Plot, what Plot?' There basically isn't a plot. I will refer to the character as 'The Pale Swordsman', since he has no consistent name or title so far in the game. This may change later, but honestly, the point is relatively moot as the gameplay is so flawed, but I thought I'd mention the story early, since there's little to say. However, enough fluff, time for some crunch.  First problem, the auto attack. It does not trigger nearly as much as it should. It feels like the Pale Swordsman is using a prison shank, because you have to get so close you could just about whisper in their ear. Which is strange, seeing as you're effectly using a buster sword, and I'm clearly within range, as I can trigger the uppercut or the slam, and it'll hit, but because of how the rage skulls work, this is not the way you should be playing, as these skills are significantly weaker with no skulls, so you have to rely on the auto hitting, which is less than reliable. This is probably to do with the game being a port from mobiles, but honestly, if you're gonna release a PC version, you should at least make use of the fact they have buttons.  Second problem, the controls generally. In short, the controls feel strange and imprecise. To elaborate, the game feels like the character is trapped in a world where the air has the consistency of treacle. Everything is very slowed down. More annoying still, I can't seem to stop bouncing off stuff... which wouldn't really be a problem, except that about 70% of things you're able to bounce off do damage. And it is not often that it's apparent this will happen.  The thorns on those vines are EXTREMELY subtle. Tangentially, things in the background, like braziers and cauldrons of hot coal should not hurt you in the way they do, especially when they don't hurt ANYTHING besides you.  Though back to the controls point, it's often difficult to even tell when you're going to bounce. Why do I bounce off the normal ground when I'm using the whirling blade jump attack? Even sillier, why do I *sometimes* bounce off the Ground, and even the AIR? If it happened reliably one way or the other, it would be fine, but you can't rely on it. This will be a point later. Also, the Charge attack triggers WAY too easily. Which again, wouldn't necessarily be so bad, since it's the only way to get anywhere in a hurry... but with pits that do 50 damage (in a game where your base health is 100), you end up triggering the charge, when you don't want to. Which at best wastes a Rage Skull, and at worst makes you go down a pit and lose roughly half your HP.  Third and Last major gameplay problem: the Enemies. Basically all of them. You get ridiculous situations where you try (or as previously stated, don't try) to use your charge attack and charge into the back of a charging boar... only for you to be damaged by the ♥♥♥♥ of a retreating boar... Are they wombats? Do they have an armour-plated rear? But then you have the nigh-bullet hell amount of projectiles that are sent around the battlefield... and wouldn't you know it, you have no dodge roll, dash or any kind of reliable defense aside from the jump, which feels you're on the moon... and with the bouncing problem mentioned earlier...  This got to be ridiculous when I was faced by a helicopter, which shoots seeker missiles... and I had to have an aerial duel with it over a strip of wooden palisade... The unreliability of the Air bouncing I said about? Yeah, anytime I didn't bounce of the air or the helicopter, I ended up falling onto the palisade and taking damage from the palisade, unless I used the charge in midair to save myself. Which of course wasted a Rage Skull, because I can't choose to only use the charge as an evasive dash. Instead, I basically have to use the weak version of the Buzzsaw jump attack to slowly whittle away health. Except when I glitch and cling to the helicopter like Spiderman... then I unleash auto-attack blades of fury, before dying because I can't tell I'm being hit (as it's just shotgunning me with it's smaller weapons).  So to sum up, nice idea, very flawed execution, tests for storyline came back negative, controls feel strange, when I die I feel cheated. The game doesn't do much to endear itself to me, so even when I try to like it, it just saps my enthusiasm.",-1
"I have a lot more hour into this from before it was on Steam but I gotta say, even though they removed maps they still gave us a game worth playing. It has a lot of complex mechanics that help with creating amazing builds but it also lets new people who are unfamiliar with the game be able to build and have fun too.   I will give this a 10/10, would RIP Bedroom again.",1
game was losts off fun but was a bit too short for my liking. but just like the other one lots off killing and stuff but not worth buying at full price.,1
"Dangit, I'm out of puzzles.",1
This game is totally awesome!! Recommend this game to everybody who likes 2D game,1
Great game. The don't let you quietly murder entire crowds though. Someone must have complained.,1
"Nice game, runs smooth and everything.",1
The best ♥♥♥♥ing story of a game that I have finished !,1
"Created EA Games, was a millionaire with tons of sheep buying my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequels",1
"There's a lot to like here: story mode is well crafted, the interface is easy to use, and new cards can be earned at a reasonable rate without spending any money. Deck building is flexible and extremely open ended. Whatever weird idea you have, you can make. My only complaint is that the game occasionally crashes to desktop when starting a match.",1
"Republic Commando is probably the best thing that has, or ever will, come from the Prequel Trilogy. The game take a grounded, almost Original Trilogy-like approach to the period and battles it presents, and in doing so, becomes all the more stylish and likeable for it. This more personable style comes across in the characters as well with any one member of Delta squad having more personality in their pinky finger than Padme Amidala has in her entire body.   On the gameplay side of things, Republic Commando almost feels like a Rainbow Six/early Halo lovechild. The player, in the role of Boss, has near total control over their squadmates, which can lead to some excellently rewarding shootouts against Separatist forces. For all it focus on tactics though, Republic Commando adopts the semi-bullet sponge enemies of Halo and similar series, which can be frustrating at times, though it doesn't significantly harm the experience.   Republic Commando is a game that does many things right and very few things even partially wrong, and it's a must play for Star Wars fans and shooter fans alike.",1
Great game! I have played it so much i think my finger fell off.,1
"By far the best puzzle platformer game i've ever played, it's a steal for it's current price at 75% off (around 2.5€). The graphicstyle is unique and its just beautiful. Gameplay is pretty fun even if you are alone as the game is pretty addicting IMO (mostly due to the leveling system). The game is pretty hard on 'hard' difficulty and there is also a 'very hard' mode if you are looking for a challenge. Hours of gameplay: 20+ (If you want all the achievements).",1
"Hearts of Iron 4 is certainly a game where you need patience in some way or another. If its learning it or if its naval invading a totally bunkered in USA until you say '♥♥♥♥ it, nuke that sh....'.  The first start WILL be very confusing, but it is, mostly, easy to understand and definatly less confusing and complicated than Hearts of Iron 3 in my opinion.  It also has so many options for the player to play a nation historical, or completly ahistorical and wreck ♥♥♥♥. &lt;.&lt; Iam sorry. Change history is what I meant.  And then.... then we have mods.  Hundreds, thousands of mods to enjoy and change up your game.  The only things I have to talk about that are negative are the rather... uh... incompetent AI and the 'not too good' Multiplayer netcode. Its pretty much not possible to consistenly play on highest speed and depending on distance (ping) not even the 4th or 3rd of the 5 speed levels. And about the AI: I assume they gotta work on that more. It already got 'better'.  But its still alltogether a great game in my opinion and as long as there are free mods that are WAY better than the DLCs by Paradox you to pay for but dont offer enough for the price, I look at you 'Together for Victory', I will keep playing it.  I hope I helped you with this review at least a little on the decision of buying this game or not. :)",1
I'm glad that there's no :poop: emoticon in this game! But that's the only positive side...  Pro: - No poop - A new 'software' on Steam  Con: - The game is poop  10/10 never poop again,-1
"To call this game light hearted would be a severe understatement. A simple hour of fun bullet hell gameplay with a gentle sense of humor. The characters are cute, Princess Remedy herself is adorable. The gameplay has a steady curve, I never felt it was too easy or too challenging throughout the story. It's free, just play it!",1
"Played for 52 hours,still cant headshot an enemy with a tranqulizer pistol properly.  9.25/10.  Still better at this than I am in Counter-Strike.",1
This new DOOM is all money worth!  Singleplayer is like DOOM 1+2 - AWESOMENESS Sound is BAM!   I would buy it again!,1
"EA still shows how garbage it is , look at the battlefield 1 servers rental prices hahaha my god, not to mention not releasing mass effect 3 on steam and completing the trilogy I could understand the andromeda but for gods sakes , EA so god damn greedy they didnt cared . ORIGIN IS CANCER AND UPLAY .   1. If you didnt played the first mass effect dont start the second. 2. This game I can compare to the witcher 3 its soooo good. 3. Mass effect 1 gameplay is cancer but mass effect 2 is lit af  4.Your character can be transfered from game to game with your choices (doesnt matter origin or steam 5.I regret not playing this game sooner",1

"I can't wait for the sequel, 'How do you Do it 2: In the Butt'",1
One of my all time fav games!,1
"This game is great! I only have one suggestion for the player. Don't play this in one session. Maybe one job sequence or half per session. Otherwise it will become repetitive. But it's still super fun and rather immersive! It's great for showing off the Vive to friends. They'll hardly want to take off the headset! One time, one person who was fairly new to VR tried to put down one of the controllers on a countertop. Of course, it fell to the ground. But that's just an example of how engaging this title is. I would recommend it even more if it was cheaper. If it's on sale, definitely pick it up. If not, do so anyway.   Also, experiment with the game! Try throwing things around and making crazy combinations of pizza and soup and whatnot. If you can't tell, I've spent most of my time in this game as a chef. Try throwing stuff into the fishtank. You'll thank me.",1
"I can't think of a bad thing to say about SOMA. It grabs you and doesn't let go. A terrifying, unrelenting story that very much will make you question what...or who...you are.  I couldn't get enough of how gorgeous this game looks, too. My screenshot folder is massive. Absolutely brilliant, loved every second. Will be replaying.  It's a steal at it's current price...if you're into sci fi, or horror...this is a must have.",1
ITS MY Top 3 games i love!!!!!!!!!!! ,1
"For those of you looking to find a game close to the Tiger Woods games, then this is the game for you. To be honest, the course creator is a bit of an aquired taste, however to those who can use it, there are some absolute masterpieces on the community section. From Augusta to Whistling Straights, there is always a new course to play.",1
Who knew finding maggots would be a good thing,1
"I may have limited play time for this game but I've actually played the second one on PSP, so here we go...  It's not a JA2: Unfinished Business, or an Xcom, however it's a solid story driven turn based/real timeish tactical strategy game, the story is conveyed beautifully, the characters are interesting (noone is a Fidel or an Ivan Dolvich thou, or Magic, or Scully... seriously go play JA2 as well) the tactical aspect of the game is fun, easy to learn, moderately hard to master, also includes a tiny bit of customization, all in all a good game but I cannot recommend at full price, wait for a discount and give it a try, if you are a TBS fan, however if you didn't play JA2 yet, go play that one first :)",1
Like SWAT 4 with more explosions and swearing.,1
"Spectacular Open World game in which contains ALOT of features which is outstanding within the GTA Series as it adds more features than ever before.  Grand Theft Auto 5 is the story of Three criminals and their way to get a living through their shenanigans. Micheal is the rich man who has a broken family with a lazy son, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ daughter and cheatin wife, he regrets leaving the bank heist days, he has the special ability to activate Bullet Time. Franklin is the new guy to the crime group as he is an expert with cars, his special ability is to slow down time when driving for faster turns. Finally, Trevor who is the old friend hyper-Pansexual who is wild and crazy to be around, his special ability is a rage mode in which he deals more and takes less damage.  In this game you follow their story and make some choices through the way, there are too many features to talk about in a simple review but there is alot like owning businesses, houses, cars, jets, boats/submarines and interact with minigames around the world.  There is an Online mode of the game in which you can play the same activities and more with others online and can also create your own character and traits. Singleplayer is a great load of fun and tons more fun can be had playing online. this truely is game of the year.",1

"I got this because I really liked The White Chamber, a game by the same developer which I downloaded free more than a decade ago. This is not bad. It deals quite well with some issues in the mind of a troubled child but the gameplay is very tame and overall it can't quite justify a positive.",-1
 Extremely fun to play with friends,1
"I bought this game a while back. I've always loved resource management and building sims. The only problem was that I was using a last gen computer and it was painful. The nonstop lag and loading only to eventually crash was absolute torment. However, upon buying a computer that could actually run the game, I found that Cities Skylines is everything I never got in any other building game. Its graphics are beyond compare and it runs smooth as silk (on an appropriate pc).  The ony drawback is that it is ONLY a building game, void of any kind of story or mission goal. Everything is simply sterile functionality. These numbers mean you'll have fires or traffic...etc. It would be more than awesome if a story mode could be added so that the personality of your city management decisions could affect various life events for your citizens.  On the whole, it's a 5 star city builder. As a game, maybe a 3 star.",1
"It's an interesting game, with some fun ideas, but I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons.  1) It's buggy as heck. It'll crash often, and for no reason. It runs slowly and uses loads more RAM than it's graphics could ever justify.  2) It lacks depth. Strategy is surface level, and easily mastered. Limitations on gameplay make every encounter samey, and there's no plot to color them or keep things interesting. None of this would necessarily be a bad thing if the game was cheaper and ran properly.",-1
Really cool time period and very challenging but still incredibly enjoyable!,1
So dissapointing. As a game its terrible. as a total time suck with no redemable qualities its great,-1
Dude.....Im getting cancer because of the matchmaking system.,-1
"As good as the classics, ambition mode is cool, but starts out slow.  So many characters not to mention waifus",1
"As a fan of the neverhood I really wanted this to be good. But the only good thing here is the nostalgia trip for the first couple minutes. The majority of puzzles are either just weak, the rest are non sensical. It suffers from poor design, and its increadibly short. For the majority of the game, the very little story that is there is in a gibberish language.   pros -the claymation nostalgia trip is fun  cons -game is short short (I beat it in 2.5 hrs) -nonsense puzzles -story is just lacking / lack luster  Just avoid it, the nostalgia isn't worth the price of admission.",-1
"Good game, with a cool idea.",1
"This game has slowly become a part of my lifestyle. Reality is nothing more than a ceaseless void filled with clicking, explosions of gold, death of adorable little monsters, followed by more clicking. Someone save me from this perpetual torment before Clicker Heroes and I merge into a mad, clicking singularity.   It's alright. 7/10",1
"Torchlight II is a Diablo clone, but I won't blame a game for trying to improve on an old formula. What I do blame it for is how unpolished all of the mechanics are. They may exist as part of a generally-balanced whole, but most individual mechanics aren't fun or satsfying to use as they should be. This leads to a generally uninteresting experience.",-1
"Awesome graphics, awesome storyline.",1
"Very good co-op game. I had alot of fun with the hats. I recommend a controller to play because it's weird to play with the keyboard/mouse. If you only want to play with your friends, I recommend buying the bundle.  10/10 One of the best co-op games out there.",1
"Welp, since I followed what they said about 'Get it free on Steam and don't pay it later', I have it... Yep, that's it. Play it, but if you have to pay now, don't whine it because you didn't READ WHAT THEY SAID A LONG TIME AGO! -Game is cool -Playing with freinds is 10/10 -Is there hackers?",1
"This game has everything! Daemons, Detectives, Penguins, Magma! It controls very well, the cast of characters control very differently, and using their skills can take a bit of strategy. The gameplay is reminisent of Mario games, but has a lot of its own character and charm. There is a wide variety of enemies, just in the first 2 worlds! There are also some pretty cool boss fights.  The dialog in the game changes depending on the character you play as, so I'm going to have to go back and play through a few times with new characters.  There is a plentitude of powerups to aid you in your quest, ranging from whips to tutus.  You'll need those power ups too, this game gets challenging fast! I should have known that though, as the easiest difficulty is 'Double Easy'. I do enjoy a good challenge though.  The music is pretty fantastic. I am listening to the Menu music as I type, and it is just awesome. Perfect length tracks that don't get boring are key for a game like this, and that is what Yal has done.  The Art is really amazing too. It is quirky and seems to draw from a few familiar platformers. I see tiles that remind me of Sonic and Mario. The art all comes together very nicely. I particularly like the player portraits. They have a lot of character to them(pun intended).  The levels are designed well, everything is placed where it is for a reason. If you see an alternate path, there's probably something at the end of it. I love that you can see inspiration drawn from older platformers, but it doesn't drown out the originality of the game.  Overall, I love this game! I could sit here and play it for hours. I think it's my new favourite game on Steam.",1
remember when your dad would dress up in spandex and shout 'I AM THE DONGMAN' at passerby? like a couple years before he broke down entirely and was carted off to an asylum? yeah this game lets you relive those days,1

"This game is about rolling, no doubt. But it looks great, the physics are fine, could be compared with other puzzle games. The game is some kind of Jump and Roll. Yes you can even jump. You can't die as far as I know because of your very patiently helper. The music and sound-effects are well performed.  I strongly recommend you use a controller, sometimes the controls on a keyboard aren't precise enough. If you get it for less than a buck, you're lucky and won't regret it.",1
"I didn't understand why anyone would want to spend time cleaning up a bloody bath, but after playing Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage for a short time you find yourself addicted to cleaning, there is something about organising buckets of dead elf parts and after you have finished cleaning, standing back and admiring your handy work.  Top class casual gameplay!",1
"Not the greatest game I've ever played. It's about a 5/10. - Balance of weapons and perks is quite poorly done. - Could have been coded better, as it's kinda weird when doing certain actions, like trying to get past an ally. - Hit detection is APPAULING (2 out of 3 bullets don't register for me, whereas, every 1 in 3 [in earlier CoDs] would fail to register correctly). - Certain sounds, like footsteps, are quite poorly implemented and do very little when trying to hear them. - Variety of weapons is quite bad. Many recycled ones from earlier CoDs. - Lag comp is HORRIBLE. Enough said. Move along. - Lags AWFULLY anymore. - Not the worst gunfights I've seen in my days of CoD. - Q-Scoping has it's own special spot in this game. - Maps are dreadful for any person that doesn't use a Submachine Gun. Enter this game at your own risk of insanity. Don't say I didn't warn you.",-1

"Not giving a rating or anything but I was having fun with this game until I beat episode one and realized I needed to purchase the rest of the game, but I can play most of the raid mode love that, but you still have to purchase that, so buy at your own risk",1
Victor Vran has an interesting story and a strong cast of characters with good combat mechanics. Van Helsing meets The Witcher - a great combination!  Read my full  Victor Vran review  [www.therockstargamers.com] ,1

"No guts to finally cross the line and kill yourself? Fortunately, there is Dark Souls series to somewhat ease the pain of how much worse the fact that you're unable to reach what you desire most makes you feel about yourself being a miserable coward stuck to existence you never wished or agreed to be part of.",1
Because it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.,1
not much difference between this and the original except for a little bit of physics stuff you should only get this for gmod because there is npcs that you get if you own this,1
So far I have put in over 20 hours with Dota2 and the first few were frustrating trying to figure out what to build how to play against other heroes etc. As a long term LoL player I wanted a new challenge and I have got it in Dota2. Its a challenge and its going to take a long time to learn how to play and play against the pool of heroes but I feel so far this is worth it. There are a lot of differences from what im used to and I feel like a noob to the genre again. The only thing I dont like so far is I appear to see a lot of AFK's and lots of 4v5 either for my team or the other team.,1
"After failing the first time I took this game on I decided to return to the beach... forty hours laters I can testify that this is one of the best games I've played as an old-timer and Dungeon Master vet (beat it 3x on the Atari 1040ST). The puzzles range from simple to devious and some just plain Hard, yet how can you stop when the chest you want is just a door away, you just need to Open it! Once again great job guys, thanks for the good times (3am fist-pumps are a dead giveaway) and I look forward to the next effort in the series.",1
APERINTLY I HAVE THE WRONG REDER so you no if annyone nose what that is please tell BECAOUSE I DO NOT... it was a good game intel this so you no just plz tell if you no what a reader is.,1
Gameplay is terrible And Not worth for $8.99 Worst Game Ever 0/10,-1
"Surprisingly good. I've had an absolute blast playing it. Yes, the combat is a clone of the all too standard 'one button to hit, one to parry' combat that other WB and Activision games have, but the car combat is fun, exploring the wastes is great- it looks and feels a bit unlike anything outside of the Mad Max films themselves- and the feeling it creates of scavenging and barely surviving is really satisfying. It is also surprisingly satisfying to build up your goofy murder machine. It's not perfect by any means, but as far as Open World Collect The Things And Fight The Bads games go, this is one of the best in a while. Solid 8/10 handfuls of maggots unflinchingly eaten.",1
Great game a lot of jumpscares.,1
"I really L O V E this game :) A lot of hours of fun, and if you have enough of medieval world.. you can switch.. to Japan, Napoleon vars etc.. 10/10",1

used to be good but can never play just says installing first time and then nothing sad,-1
"Skyrim on steroids. (Try to) take down monstrous foes in this fantasy dungeon-crawler where all odds are against you. The Dark Souls series is among the most elite of games to accomplish. You may die a little, or you may die all the time, but it's all a part of the game. The reward and sense of accomplishment after each boss is more than enough to make up for the struggle you will be dealing with.",1
The best game 10/10!,1
"As an Isaac player I was extremely unimpressed. In Isaac there are a large variety of viable builds and items that you can use to get through the game. That is not the case here. There's 1, maybe 2 different combinations of upgrades that you can get that'll allow you to win, if you're unlucky and don't get them, you'll probably die.  The enemies are boring, the rooms are too large and confusing, there arent enough weapons or upgrades to keep gameplay interesting, and the game feel pretty clunky to play.   Overall, had I not gotten this in a humble bundle, I'd be pretty upset with my purchase.",-1
"Fun game, if you got some money to spend on DLC's. Otherwise, you better know how to deal with other people. :/",1
"Amazing! This is worth every penny. I have been able to make lots of people laugh at the tongue and odd faces i could make. I will admit though there is a few bugs but that is something you can expect out of a not yet finished product, I cant wait to see how this turns out in the future and if you are considering whether to buy this or not i recommend it,",1
Installed in win 10 but only launch screen works. the game itself didnt open. its a problem with config of my pc I guess.,1

One of the best rpg games i've ever played!   11/10 - Would bang Yennefer again!,1
I love this indie is full of gore cool weapons original execution its an 8 bit massacre game ( i wont spoil you the real story) of course it has it rage moments but try not to rage quit it really gets awesome on the way i recommend this to any who love 8 bit gore retros 9/10 why? needs MORE levels,1
i think that there were very little nicknames and it was really hard to find one ,1
"If Hell really is like how its depicted in Gat out of Hell (AKA a giant theme park with lots of stuff to do), I might actually want to visit! The story can be finnished very quickly, I probably only did a thrid of the map before I could actually confront Satan. After that, if you like all the abilities and doing all the activities in SR, you'll still have plenty to do and collect.   On the down side, you don't get to customize your character as much as in SR: you just play as a preset Kinsey or Gat. The narrative seems to be linear, in that I'm not sure if completing full loyalty quests has any effect on the story. Also, you don't really have an impact on the world besides destroying the missile towers or coloring your map purple.   Overall, I liked the game for what it was (being a $20 DLC).",1
10/10 would weeaboo again,1
"I have mixed feelings about this game, I like it, it stands on Rocksteady's great foundation for the Arkham series of games, but it feels a little too quick-timey for its own good, as well as some of the ridiculous day 1 bugs. The story's good, even if it's a little off-putting for veterans of the Arkham series, it still works and fits in very well with the chronological order of the rest of the series, without making itself seem like a direct knock-off of Rocksteady's work.  I like the game, I just wish more had been done ironing out the obvious wrinkles that somehow got missed.",1
"It's nice, lovely and cute novel reading game which has some different choices and only with right choices chu can get to the good ending.",1
"Cons :  - Terrible Support  - LAG ( Dont Join [SA] Silute , ever ) - Same Boss appearance Over and Over ( CRTL + C and CRTL + V ) , only name changes - Price of the Packages are insane - BOTS BOTS EVERYWHERE! They know about them and they only added a 'Report Bot' on the right click.... - Didnt i mention the Lag ? Yeah , Lag , a LOT  Grab your friends and play it ! But when you go for the dungeon , play alone to get more exp ( What ? ) Yeah... If you missed Alpha/Beta , dont worry ! Theres so many bugs still in the game that you will feel like you are playing the Alpha !  *TIP* Dont join [SA] Silute or Lag Your WAy To VictorY!  ",-1
Excellent RPG. The activities were varied and the puzzles of reasonable difficulty. The progression was continuously challenging without having to endlessly reload and replay. Characterization was good; you cared about the protagonist. Occasionally you had to retrace long distances but mostly for things you failed to find or complete.,1
This Matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,-1
"20+ hunters and 7 monsters with more planned for the future. Fun asymmetrically balanced game. Lots of intial content and 'production value' from the fact that this was a triple A game gone f2p. Reminds me of monster hunter but instead of having roles like blunt damage, cutting damage, status effects, and musical buffs you have damage, crowd control/paintballer, utility, and healing.",1
As close as a game can get to perfection. Absolutely outstanding with Dade's seal of approval.,1
10/10   It's gud.,1
"Insane levels, Intense music, and I love it!",1
"I absolutely love this game. I've been playing ever since it was released in NA, and it's done nothing but age well. It's not P2W, though paying, as with most games, can give you a slight advantage, here. The ONLY thing I would absolutely change in a heartbeat, and truly hope they do someday, and someday soon, is just take out the Fatigue system. Yes, I understand it was to keep people from playing too much, but things have changed since this game was released, as well as it's not only Korean anymore. *shrug* That's all I've got though. If you even remotely like 2D, instance-based, anime-themed brawlers, seriously, give this a go. I mean, it's free. At least TRY it.",1
"Fun, hard, long, replayable, the only flaws I can find in the game are the controls, which are floaty and hard, and the skill level needed. I find the game extremely hard and I have to find exploits to beat the bosses for about a quarter of the game, and the fact that it goes really slow, and to not much reward.",1
"I've had a lot of fun with this game alone, but I highly recommend grabbing a friend, a headset and playing it with him/her! It's a lot more entertaining this way!  Pros",1
"This game manages to pay homage to Homeworld, while being its very own, unique game The campaign has engaging storytelling, where one wrong decision can spell your doom  The design, artwork and music alone are worth the price of admission. Gameplay is full, yet never overwhelming",1
"Literally 5 minutes to complete this game. It's a very psychological type of game, enjoyed it.",1
"Screw Torchlight 2, or any other diablo clone that came out around its time. This game has them all beat by a country mile, and is absolutely free to boot.  No other game can boast this, on top of Steam integration, great pick up and play multiplayer, ridiculous loot, great graphics, great VA, and simple to pick up controls.  And there's so many skills you can learn, so many things to unlock and so many ways to spec a character...you will NEVER want to go back to anything less after this.",1
"When I bought this i didnt expect much (Rome 2 did that) but after my Dwarf campaign I can see now that I was WAY off, great game, unique units, and smart AI, and the diplo actually works in this TW. Been a fan of warhammer for along time and I am glad to see two of my favorite franchises come together, not saying its perfect but no game launches perfectly, but I havent had a single hiccup with the game and im sure I'll be takeing over the old world again very soon  9.5/10 for me",1
Still not working for windows 10 you shameless bunch of crooks,-1
"Your not paying for the game, your paying for the monthly electric bill...",1
"This game is VERY VERY different to the other ones. I feel this one kind of lacks gameplay wise, as (Spoilers) Its just a bunch of minigames each night (Not the pixel 8-bit ones). Scott has clearly put alot more dedication into Story for this one, and while i feel thats a nice turn from the rest of the series, i personally don't like it.   Overall, really nice effort with the minigames and voice acting, if Scott ever made another FNaF game, however, I think it should go back to the old gameplay style, while keeping similar elements such as voice acting.  Reccomended if you like Deep stories.",1
"This War Of Mine is a fenomenal game with simple rules and very simple control system but it isn't simple or easy to play. This isn't a game for players with rushing tendencies. You must be patient, careful and you must keep in mind that nothing is more important than food, water and healthy state of mind. Please developers can you tell me a release date for iPad version? I really want to play this game on my iPad Mini.",1
"Lies include, but are not limited to, Multiplayer Freighter destruction Freighters crashing into planets Desert planets Ships that have unique strengths and weaknesses Freedom with flight (not being limited to how low you can fly)   Don't buy this game unless you want less than what the interviews and trailers show Sorry Sean, but this is not close to a full and finished game that is worth the 60$   ",-1
"Buy MoW2, it's fantastic.   Brilliant WW2 strategy game on par with - or perhaps even better than Company of Heroes.  The game has a great and deep tactical layer with some micromanagement, but without resource collection - instead strategic points creates the basis for a point based economy. The game can be insanely difficult, but at the same time very rewarding, although potentially scary for many new players.   MoW2 delivers a brilliant strategy game with some tactical depth that you really shouldn't miss.",1
"Just bought the soundtrack. I've got to give these guys kudos for producing an awesome game and soundtrack while standing up for what they believe! This is a completely unique work of art, and I rarely see things that so perfectly combine speedrunning, the whole Tron vibe and a respect for the way that, to a degree, computers actually work. Though it's short, I would pay for this game. It's too cool to miss!  Seriously, though, this game is free because they wanted to make a statement. They could have cheaped out and made something boring or broken, but they wanted to do right by their message. That's the best part about this whole deal.",1
As much as I live this game it is annoying to play due to various bugs and crashes. I'm not even able to play the game at the moment.,-1
"To be completely honest, i have no idea how i got this game. One day it simply appeared in my inventory. ALREADY DOWNLOADED.  I have no idea how i got this game but that's okay because it is the most beautiful thing i've ever played.  10/10 would watch myself die and then explode into more blood than 30 elephants crushed by a car again",1
"Exquisite game! The combat is immensely enjoyable and keeps you looking forward to the next battle. I especially like the campaign on it. But those who are fans of large scale player-vs-player battles, it's got all of that for you too. If you like medieval combat, this is for you!  There are also mods for the game that allow survival-type gameplay with other players that also incorporates RPG elements into the game within multiplayer. There isn't a single part about this game I don't enjoy. If you don't care about graphics, and want some fun, engaging gameplay and combat, then Warband is right for you.",1
" Status ;  ' COMPLETED '  So we have read the eb and flow of the fourms, and reviews from tarts who have no clue how to be unbiased, and not to unsult the hard work that goes into games. People tend to be overcritical when they do not understand something, or have seen both sides of the fence.   Also if is too advanced for some, they say things are broken or not working. Believe me, we have played and tried to see what is true.  Strap on your leaf, grab your stick... we being our journey...  FPS... very nice for the graphics... CPU running smooth. No hangs like people are brash about, if you checked the minimums, which is what we are using at this moment, there is no problem. People you can not upgrade your video card, and not the monitor and vice versa. Both or not at all or you will get framelock in many cases. Now we are not saying it never happens with loads or if your being impatient because this game can be intense... but if you keep it all in check...  This game runs with no disturbing trouble on minimum requirements.  So you start on the big hunt... con... maybe I am allergic to Mammoth! You finish the big hunt... con... see first reference, anyways he/she was big as Sh*t!  Beaten up, bodies everywhere and my stick is broken. I need to pick some leaves and bandge myself quickly.  Now the fun really beings... con.. I don't know sh*t on how to play and... wait... yes I am on fire... damn. FIRE! HELP! So I ran and jumped into water!  Con... it was shallow and I was 10 feet up... OUCH! Mother F..ker! (Really making us laugh and cry) Restart.... no... not quite yet....  So onto the pro's, but there really are too many to list but I will do my best, because I dont have my nerd assistant with her blackberry taking my.... um.... notes. Yes! She indeed when present is good... but back to the game!  Ok the pro's;  Graphics, goes without writing/saying. Fluid. (Play too long a bit of a hang here and there).  You can even check your Vsync in game! FPS is fabulous 90% of the time... and that seemed to be a huge problem on PS4. So I am telling you get PC, if you have decent gear over the PS4 or Xbox versions. Also the glitch screen load things, on pc, non existant.  Content,.... so much damn content that Oprah couldnt even catalog it! Fun, easy to learn it all, but a lot of sh*t to do in this game... ie tons of content but not confusing at all unless you have no comon sense as I reference below....***  For example... Hunt, be hunted, havest, be harvested, kill, be killed, cook, starve, cook so bad you still starve, search, create, destroy, burn a village, burn yourself, burn your village, burn the jungle, craft this! No... craft that your spoiled (dirty word)... your fart... make no sound, fart with a friend, at a friend and make a friend, shoot, crawl, swim, run, snipe, get sniped, sittng and resting, get jumped buy anything including bee's.   There is so many skills, things to do, but not rediculous and nothing is a grind at all.  Its completly immersive and realavent all you do and accomplish. You have to also build your tribe to a great size just to even start any mid to late game. Over 100 hours and you wont finish or come close ot beating this game... and NO THERE IS NO GRIND!(Unless you want it that way.) There is just enough to make you feel like your really a caveman/cavewoman that sh*ts in the woods and whipes his/her ♥♥♥ with his friends fingers, then throws it at his/her mate, in which back in caveman terms... its says.... I love you.  So mixed reviews... I get it... everyone expected this and that... but the simple fact is the game will entertain you and you will get every bit of your moneys worth!  Plain and simple, as prior notes... you won't finish it in under 100 hours is my opinion. It never is redundant, unless you choose to make it that way, the world evolves as you do.  Oh and YES!....your head needs to be on a swivel! If your tired, lazy and not paying attention running at full speed because your impatient... your screwed!  Now, if it gets intense you can always hide and rest, conquer another camp and sleep there, or offer your ♥♥♥ to someone special that might just hook you up for the night.  There has never been a game like this, with this much content with the great FPS, graphics and only a few bugs here and there but you have to be really looking for them and none of the effect gameplay.  Its not too easy, its not too hard, and you can choose your own path and have the freedom of where and when... except for animals.... YES DONT CRY... WILD PRIMITVE ANIMALS ACT LIKE WILD ANIMALS!  Everyone is on the food chain and MAN certainly was NOT at the top in this time period!!  You will also see many saying... this is frusterating... it lags (because they have zero response time and hand and eye coordination).   ***SO now... allow me to introduce to you many kiddies and adults I like to call (Insert Polite Explative here)... or a better definition... PEOPLE WITH NO COMMON SENSE!   If you suffer from this, then this game is not for you.  For example... See bear... run at bear... Eaten. Dumb.  Here is another... need to burn village... stand in hut your about to light and lock the door.   In closing, get FarCry Primal, support this more than you did if you were suckered into FarCry4 after loving 3, this will redeem the FarCry glory.  If you loved FarCry 4, happy for you, this will stomp the dogshit out of it!  Stone age...  No gunz... just your mind, fire, rocks and sticks, creativity and nature!  ♥♥♥ if you were really in the stone age as a caveman or cavewoman. Brains and brawn. Its not easy or kind, as nature does not cooperate and people didnt have pets. Deer's will kick your ♥♥♥ and a squirrel will eat your eye even tho you gave him your nutz.

"I love this game from the kill shots with bullet flight cam to the beautiful environments, to the crazy low price. 'Talk About Bang For Your Buck', 'this game has you in it's sights'!

"I have to admit I am generally not a huge fan of indie games, but this one works for me. The graphics, as you can tell, are not that stellar, but it works well in the context of the game.  I would characterize the game as a puzzle game, with the main goal trying to figure out how to open the various doors without getting shot. The game is designed very well, with auto-save checkpoints letting you go back a couple seconds, so you are not penalized for dying and experimenting. I wish more games were like this as redoing the same thing over and over is not very fun. As you progress through the game you will unlock new techs which can drastically change the strategies available - this adds some re-playability to the game. The game takes 4-5 hours to beat, which for me is a perfect length - long enough to understand the depth, but short enough that the story isn't drawn out for no good reason.  Overall, 8/10.",1
it's been years since this came out why do you even need to read my ♥♥♥♥ing review you probably shouldve already decided whether or not you want to get this game,1

"I didn't like this game, i couldn't read anything and it gave me motion sickness. Even the first level is hard to play. Not a fun game to play in my opinion.",-1
"Super Meat Boy is such an awesome game. It does have a great soundtrack and great rage ability. Now I say that with full happiness due to the fact that it made me rage but still made me play it more and more. The one issue for me was the fact that, now this is my opinion, the game sucked for me to be played with a keyboard and not a controller. Which is one of my reasons why I want to buy one. Overall, I think this game is great and a must buy. PLUS: You should totally get the soundtrack for it.  Graphics: 9 - Great artistic game Sound: 9.5 - Love the sound and the soundtrack. Gameplay: 9 - Very fun gameplay, except for the constant death Story: 8.5 - Pretty alright story.",1
"This is a great way to lose friends. This game will have you screaming, possibly raging, and perhaps confused. That being said, it is a great game to play with friends. It is enjoyable, although frustrating as well. It is challenging, but that is a good aspect of competitve games. I bought the game when it was on sale and bought a few extra copies to share with friends. I am certain I would not pay full price for this game. Playing online runs pretty smoothly, sometimes there is a bit of lag, but nothing that changes the game's odds. I have played with another person using a single computer and it was very reponsive, and a great time. I personally think for your own sanity it may be better to have people at separate computers.   TLDR: Good, challenging game that is fun with friends. Wait till it goes on sale, buy a few copies for friends to play too,",1
My personal favourite game ever made ever.,1
this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ get kill because of glitch and camper nice game,-1
"Infuriating. I liked the story tho it was exceptionally short at best leaving out massive gaps. The soundtrack was ok, but i really dislike the walk into things to attack it's the weirdest thing to get used to in a game. i highly recommend a controller do not play on the keyboard. It's totally doable as I beat the game with a keyboard but my hands hurt from sitting in the same position to long, so take breaks. The graphics are what you expect but i really had a massive issue with navigating thru the final part of the game. It's supposed to be a circle but you'd never know if you didn't google the maps to figure out by shape which floor your on. With like 25 floors that's highly annoying. I'd say if your a fan of the game get it, but if your like me who never even heard of ys I'd totally pass. Its a game for games sake but that is about it to be honest. As soon as I finished it I deleted it and never plan on going back. I was disappointed. Thankfuly this was a christmas gift so I got it for free, my friend claims he can beat it in 30 minutes and I still think he's lying as it took me 4 hrs via using google taking pics of the maps with my phone and going back into the game so that I could figure out where I was and what I needed to do. For a game this old I shouldn't have to google every 5 feet to play it. Will say if you do play this game look up a guide (make sure theirs no viruses on the site and that its FREE do NOT pay for any guide ever!) and get the heal ring. Also just like the elder scroll series, save save save save save. I had 5 seperate saves going just in case especially at darm tower.",-1

"  Recently, I finally got around to finishing MoH.  The amount of times I've spent repeatedly stabbing a single person is most likely more than the amount of time it takes to complete the entire storyline.  The actual game was fun, and got me interested in it, as it has a lot of depth, and details for what's happening, although a bunch of unrealistic scenarios (believe it or not, a person doesn't wipe out an army of 100 by himself). The ending was depressing, and made me want to kms.  10/10",1
Once i managed to get this game going (and not very well may i add) i made a review about Hello Games latest tech Demo. Check it out if you want:          YouTube™ Video:  No Man's Sky 5 Minute Review&nbsp;,-1
Finally DOTA2 is playable. But you're still better off playing Heroes of the Storm,1
Super fun game and cant wait for KF2,1

"Be aware, this will be a wall of text. Scroll to the bottom for TL;DR.  Having amassed 1,000's of hours worth of gameplay from MGS1 all the way upto TPP. I feel i can give my general feelings towards this title and allow my butthurt to flow.  Its clear from alot of apsects that Kojima knew he was on the way out of Konami when this title was being developed. This is made quite clear by the fact his name is shown 4-5 times before EVERY mission. This i can only presume was to annoy Konami execs once he had finally left his position.  Now, onto the game itself. Graphics where great, you can really tell that the FOX Engine was something Kojima embraced fully and im sure it made his love for RPG's easier to integrate into MGS. The type of weapon customisation available was fantastic, apart from the whole Motherbase building, which i felt was just another RPG aspect thrown into the game which felt pretty pointless to me. I spend as little as possible timewise around MB.  The voice acting was great as usual, but the story compared to the rest of the series was lacking.The 'boss fights' where non-existant which is something an MGS fan will have grown to expect and love. Kiefer Sutherland literally comes and goes throughout the game. You can go hours without hearing him say a word. Including some long ♥♥♥ cutscenes where he just sits there like a ♥♥♥♥in mute staring at the other characters while they talk. The gameplay was fun and the missions originially where too... until the repetitiveness kicks in. Then you realise its just 5-6 missions rehashed over and over. I also felt there was a complete lack of an ending. The game itself loses alot of what makes it MGS. It effectively turns into Fulton Simulator.   I would recommend the game at a discount price. 7/10  TL;DR +Graphics/FOX Engine look amazing +Wide range of Customisation and Unlockables +Large enough maps +Voice acting was good +Game is fun +Great music choices  -Distinct lack of Snake Voice acting -Repetitive Missions -Lack of real boss fights -KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS, HIDEO KOJIMA GAME, PRODUCED BY HIDEO KOJIMA..etc. -Random RPG elements thrown in for little to no reason.     ",1
Graphics aren't that great. Not the best first person shooter. But it's really fun! Where else can you kill Nazi Dinosaurs?,1
Community (from what I've played) is great! The game is pretty fun and it requires communication and cooperation between your team. It's awesome just being able to choose where you fly and how you approach an enemy ship. Definately a good buy.,1
This game to me is one of the best in the field of sniper games high-end graphic's great story and fun multiplayer i give it a 10/10 but thats my opinion. play it find out for your self,1
"EDIT 2: The game is now up to 72% positive, exactly as predicted, it has climbed after the initial crap PC complainers.  I also haven't seen a review that compares this to Gears of War, but it feels EXACTLY like Gears of War in terms of movement. I.E. no jump, moving cover to cover, vaulting. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Seeing A LOT of negative reviews with issues like 'not saving' and 'generic enemies that aren't very smart blah blah..' Sounds like you people need to play your missions on hard, as I've been wiped on several missions with full groups so far. I wouldn't listen to these people complaining about day one issues, you never should. This is a AAA title and will have any and all issues dealt with eventually. Though, I've encountered none.  Sounds like a lot of people just want to join the Ubisoft hate bandwagon. Or your computer is just a piece of junk, as is your internet. Wait for graphics drivers or something if you're honestly concerned.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT: The hate is strong.",1
cool game expect the queue,1
Who would spend 300+ hours clicking cubes for almost no reason?   Not me! I spent 300+ hours letting an autoclicker click cubes for no reason instead.,1
"Addictive tower defense and action hybrid. I easily put 100 hours into this game, fending off wave after wave. This game is good when played single player, but it really shines in multiplayer. There are plenty of maps and tons of DLC to keep the game from getting old, so grab some buddies and play this fun game!",1
Since i played the game my 'One Handed' Skill increased by 75%.  Would rank up that skill anytime again.,1
95% shot with shotgun missed! 13% shot with shotgun critical!! 10/10,1
"I was skeptical at first, but eventually this game becomes very addicting. I have had many late nights where I have stayed up an extra 6 hours just to play this.",1
played the entire first level with the game telling me the controls of an xbox controller. and no my controller wasnt plugged in.  10/10,1
very gued,1
"Exploring a planet overtaken by its radioactive star when I found a tiny person to hold a leaf above my head. Forget about saving the universe, this is all I'll ever need.",1
This game is truly amazing. It's easily one of my favorite RPG's of all time!,1
"From reading the other reviews, it seems like people only saw this game as an advocate for manipulation and 'friendzoning'. Yes, the protagonist doesn't say what he means, and yes, he definitely wants to sleep with Emily. But do the people who cry foul of this kind of behaviour really pretend that it doesn't exist? Does everyone in their life speak directly and honestly on every issue all the time? Of course not. This is a teenager verbally fumbling to a childhood crush, and besides the punctuation is very realistic in that regard.  But I don't even see it as a story about 'friendzoning', and for the other reviews to generalise that it is does the game a disservice. At it's core it's about childhood friends (of any calibre, from schoolmate to lover) growing apart as they follow different paths in life. The sad ending, in which the protagonist slowly realises that their friendship is over, can be gut-wrenchingly drawn out with dead-end small talk if the player so chooses. I have personal experience with childhood friendships that end in exactly the same way, and to relive it was powerful. The slow descent into aquaintences followed by a end of commuication completely; this game hit home.  I'm in no way championing manipulation or ulterior motives, but the 'friendzone' tones are secondary to what I feel is a strong message about childhood friendship packaged up in simple storytelling. The time skips followed by natural-ish references to each year past were well done, and the player fills in the gaps with their own experiences and imagination.   Ignore the Social Justice Brigade looking for another witch to string up and within this disarmingly simple interactive story you can find an emotional core with a real message beneath.",1
"fun, lots of random events adding alot of replayability, always adding free updates to the game to challenge you at heisting",1
"Really good game, nice layout, Not boring, Pretty good graphic's.",1
I play this a lot and it is probably my favourite game nuff said yo.,1
"ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND, GOT PLACES TO GO, GOTTA FOLLOW MY RAINBOW!  sonic and shadow levels are extemely fun and so is the chao garden!   but the rest are meh but still enjoyable!   1000/10 needs more bowling alleys",1
"This game gives you a nice unbiased view of 'The Streets', very good for relatability. Hilarious AI won't leave your immersion seemless but you will learn a lot about yourself along this adventure.",1
"Not the best adventure ever, but not the worst either. The ending was somewhat predictable given the theme and all the clues, but the game sets the mood right, so it's fine. Anyway, the game is free, so take an hour of your time and see for yourself.",1
nice and relaxing,1
This isn't just a game it's artwork.  i can highly recommend this game for powerful pc beasts (just like my self)  i can't say anything about the story haven't completed it yet.  here are my thoughts and opinion.  Stuff I Like About This Game: Good Mechanics Badass Weapons Use The Igni Luke Snorting Villages Hick Up Villages Badass Knights Creepy Ghosts/Demons Good Graphics/Plays Good With 1070 And A i5-6500 Stable 60 Fps With Hairworks OFF So Far the Story Is Good I'm Addicted To This Game  To be honest i can't find anything bad about this game cuz i haven't played it for a while  I love rpg games to and if you do AND like games with nice graphics.  then I can highly recommend this is the game for you.,1
"This game has given me a feeling I don't feel often.  For some reason everytime I play this game I get the great feeling of control. It feels as if I control the enemy's lives, I decide when they die. Maybe it's just me being petty, but I love feeling like god. I can decide when they live, or when they die, and they have no idea where I am. I love this game.",1
Beautiful visuals and great storyline. The ony con is it's very linear driver and short. 8/10.,1
"Downwell is one of the best indie games I have played in a long time. It features a nice performance on even the crappiest of PCs and has really good presentation. I love this game and ever since I bought it, its literaly all I play! I recommend this game to anyone who craves the feeling of playing something old from the 90's. Downwell gets a 10/10.",1
"Above-average western RPG (paper mario, etc) gameplay. If SP doesn't grate on you, this is a pretty enjoyable game. Fans already bought and played through this game so there's no point in tailoring a review for them, but normies will likely enjoy this as long as you can put up with a lot of fart jokes.",1
"Great Game at launch, soon became a horrible game due to updates. But recently picked it up again and its back to its old glory.",1
It stutters like crazy... This completely destroys the game-play experience for me.   Homeworld (Remastered) runs very smoothly by comparison.  I have tried with and without SLI ennabled.  I run two Nvidia Titan X Pascal cards and an i7 5960x CPU with an Intel 750 series PCI-E SSD on Windows 10 64 bit Home edition. Monitor is 1440p / 144Hz (G-Sync). Nvidia driver is 372.90  Note that SLI support appears to be absent in this title. I can't speak for Crossfire support.,-1
Unfortunately this game crashes a lot. Last time required hard reboot because I wasn't able to kill the process in task manager. So disappointing.,-1

"pretty fun f2p, though if you want to lvl up farther than lvl 20 u'll have to buy the expansion pack thingies in game, still a pretty fun game if you have friends in game.",1
"This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied.",1
Such a good version of this game i swear! deffitanly a good purchase :D,1
"I only recommend this because it's Age of Empires at its core. The single player campaign still can't hold hold a candle to the base game...am i the only one that cares about the quality of the campaign? In any case, the writting is bland, the voice acting is TERRIBLE, no music plays in the background when the story is delivered making it that much more awkward.   Some of the campaigns are creative like The Mountain Seige (Le Loi) but otherwise most of them are just boring. I also have a problem with the difficulty in this game (like with The African Kingdoms DLC). It seems like the higher the difficulty, the more 'free resources' the opponents get. When I look at the enemy's economy I don't see how this guy is swamping me with high level units with only that may workers. IT'S CHEATING!!! If I were to harass the enemy workers, distrupt trade routes, destroy a towncentre or two it wouldn't affect them in the least! So much for strategy.  Also archers, skirmishers, and most infantry are still useless compared to cavalry. I would only bother with archers if they did not cost GOLD! I'd rather spend gold on cavalry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S :D! To conclude this review, MAKE AOE4 ALREADY!",1
"Loved it, very nice different setting from what we often have in VN's. Can sit here spouting praises, but basically if you read this, go buy it. Really well worth it.",1
"  This is an extremely light-hearted and fun RPG, similar to Earthbound.    Seriously. Earthbound is all I can think about while I play this game. Regardless, Jesus Christ RPG Trilogy is a set of 3 role playing games based around the life of Jesus of Nazareth. As a Christian I find this game very interesting, light hearted, and even with it's some-what ridiculous jokes and modern references, not at all offensive.  The JC games have a well implemented 'turned based' combat system, meaning you and your allies attack, then your enemy and their allies attack. The visuals aren't mind-blowing, but this isn't a problem as the game is designed to imitate a 90's RPG game, once again similar to Earthbound.  This game is very fun, cute, corny and very humorous, I do enjoy playing JC RPG Trilogy very much, and I do intend to play this game a lot more.  Please play this game. It's free-to-play, it's very decent in scope and aspiration, that deserves some love. Surely the fact we have another kid-friendly game on Steam is something also worth praise.",1
"The game is kind of short and repetivtive, but for it's price, I really recommend it! You will surely get at least 1 hour of gameplay, which is somewhat impressive for a title this simple. The graphics and sounds are okay, the gameplay feels balanced, and the customization and battles are really well designed. Overall, I'd give it a 8/10",1
any game that lets you ram a ship then board it is all good in my books... All that said it is alot of fun and well woth the money.,1
It's a good game though i wish i would be able to keep destroying everything instead of having to fight a warden every time i wanna just kill cops and people.,1
"i have 200+ hours put into this game and i have been playing this game since release because i preordered.  the division was a REALLY good game at the beginning but later on when the patches started rolling out it got worse with bugs.  the devs finally fixed a bug that screwed me over because i play a tank class but now with patch 1.31 i have run into 5 more bugs that make my game unplayable ONCE AGAIN!!.  the devs obviously dont care to much which makes me worried about their upcomming watch dogs 2.  this was a hard thing for me to do because i loved this game so much but just all the bugs ruined it for me so i decided that im done with this game and uninstalled it.  i want to reccomend the division to other people but i dont want others to waste their money on a game with so many bugs.  dont get me wrong this was a AMAZING game at the start but it got destroyed by people ♥♥♥♥♥ing that the game is unfair, i personally found the division extremely fun but annoying aswell due to ubisofts choices.  anywho dont waste your money on this game, if you want an exciting MMO RPG to play with your friends then i would highly reccomend the elder scrolls online :D.",-1
"Feels very unfinished, as if they just slapped the 3D element onto match-4 and then released it changing nothing else.",-1
"Like Assassin's Creed, just written by Tolkien then completely changed the concept of LotR entirely. Thanks monolith.",1
"I really liked Half-Life: Source, especially since it was made on the new Source Engine, I see the remastered version of Half-Life, Half-Life: Source, is more like a test-run for Half-Life: 2, I expect that before they release the new Half-Life 3, (if ever) then I expect them to release a remastered version of Half-Life 2, as well. Anyways, I liked this much better than the original, the FX were much better.",1
"Excellent shooter. Teamwork is necessary for survival! Although you can play solo, this game is best played with friends.",1
"Pure, brutal, cool. Harder than life.",1
Insanely fun! Buy it.,1
Grand theft auto v is a beautiful and fun game. Both story mode and online. I only have one problem. The police are very violent. Just one star and they shoot you. But beside that everything is awesome,1
"If you like repetitive gameplay or GTA-style PvP this is the game for you otherwise, run for your life!  It's fun Co-Op game to play with friends other than that it's pretty bad. ",-1
Looks great! and it is very decent!,1
"Fairly short, but quite enjoyable Puzzlebox game.  I found the story quite fun. Looking forwards to playing the second ^.^  I wouldn't spend too much on it, but while it's on sale, certainly worth it.",1
so.... this game is suprisingly fun!,1
nc game but i love CSGO,1
"Crazy scale. Fun romp, and best of all the co-op possibilities are amazing.",1
"  i really enjoyed the humor in this game, but my youtbue channel's subscuirbers did not , haha! i liked it, i always enjoy british comedy ^^ with that being said, the puzzles were not always clear as to the answer, i eventually started clicking things in hopes for a solution to appear.  Im probably not paying enough atteniton ^^b",1
A Great Game!!!!,1
"Thinking about playing EverQuest for the first time? Don't. Only come back if you've played back in the day and you are returning for a nostalgia run. This is not an MMO you should visit if you've never played before. Why? Well, let's see:   Terrible Developer Communication  -- The developers have poor communication with the community. They never explain what is happening when the servers are down, they never explain why they decided to take X path instead of Y path, they lock any threads on the official forums if you criticize them, and they don't reply to any threads outside of their own. Unacceptable and completely unprofessional.   Outdated  -- If you've played back in the day then you'll be used to the graphics, thus you probably won't be too taken aback by how ugly EverQuest looks.  -- You also have the jumbled, unorganized, messy UI the game gives you. When you first log onto your character you'll be surprised how I wasn't exaggerating. It's that bad. I honestly think it's the worst UI out there from any other game I have ever played.   Lazy Developers &amp; Lack of Content  Another developer complaint? Yes! They deserve it. They are in charge of what direction the game is going, and they are always going down the wrong path. Incompetent?  -- Back when the first EverQuest expansion was released ('Kunark') you got 28 zones, that's right  28  zones to explore and tackle. How many zones in the current expansion of EverQuest? In 'Empires of Kunark' you get....  7  zones! Hahaha... It's hard not to laugh when you compare the two. This expansion takes place on the same continent of Kunark. You lack 21 zones to explore due to the current lazy developer team. It's quite sad.  -- No maps. That's right, you get very little in-game maps. You need to go to a third-party website to download maps. This shouldn't happen...  -- Speaking of the current expansion, did you know they have the nerve to charge the same amount they charged for 'Kunark' for the most recent expansion 'Empires of Kunark'? With 1/4 the content! How people accept this is beyond me. Actually, thinking about it, they are probably lifelong players who can't take off their nostalgia goggles to see things clearly.   Lack of Players / Forced to 'Box' to Make Progress  -- Let me explain how things are going to go for you if you are new and/or if you decide to come back:   Level 1 : 'Wow... this is an ugly UI. Um... What do I do?'  2 - 11 : 'Ok, I survived the tutorial. I was alone the entire time... Maybe I can join a group once I leave here?'  12 - 50 : 'Crescent Reach looks cool! Nice zone.', 'Hmm... still no groups even though I'm level 50! What the hell? Where is everybody?', 'How did that guy writing that review on Steam know this would happen? Does this happen to everybody?'  51 - 65 : 'What the hell happened? Why is it so hard to level up? I'm getting less than 1% a kill and it's taking FOREVER to make progress.', 'Also, where are the groups? This game is top-heavy, I guess. Maybe if I keep pushing forward I can finally get a group.'  66 - 75 : 'Ok, I'm going to quit. The grind is real and it's a real bore. Not even difficult, just killing hundred of enemies for less than 1% EXP.'  75 - 105 : 'Finally, I'm high enough level to group with somebody!'  You: Hi, level XX [class here], want to group? Players: No, you're not in our clique, so... You: ...Damn it! Guess I'll 'box'   What is 'Boxing'?  - Boxing is a term used when a player has more than one account -- usually one or two additional accounts. You do this so you can tackle the games content since the game was designed for you to have a group. If you control three accounts, you can place three mercenaries (computer controlled players) in your party to complete your party. Instead of playing $15 a month, you pay $45 (if you have three accounts total). Depending on how good you are at controlling all your characters you can tackle every single thing in EverQuest besides most raids. Solo content? Obviously. Group content? Depends on what classes you picked and how good you are. Raids? A lot of old raids you can take, however once you reach the 12th (out of 23) or so expansion it nearly becomes impossible due to mechanics and needing 6+ players to enter the zone.   In conclusion...  Only come back if you have played before and you want to take care of that itch you have. Don't bother with EverQuest if you are new and want to try an 'old school' MMO. It's not worth it. Any other MMO besides EverQuest, is what I suggest. The game shows no signs of improving, terrible developers, not enough content, and most importantly: no players!!",-1
I fear the M on my keyboard more than ever before i played this game... Oh my SO MANY Ms IN THIS REVIEW!,1
"Incredible. I used to think Skyrim was the most amazing game of that year but this game has, believe it or not, changed my mind. :3",1
"a dire warning to america, sent back in time to us via a game that's too hard for me to beat",1
"Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is a great game if you've ever wondered what it would be like to be one of the soldiers in a Rome 2: Total War battle. Being able to train up your own army, be a loyal vassal, found your own kingdom, and pretty much ride around doing whatever you want makes this a pretty great medieval battle simulator.  The only weak point of this game (and it is relatively true of all games of this nature) is that there isn't a story or any guide for what to do. You have to set your own goals and make your own story. If you're looking for a game that tells you what to do and holds your hand then this isn't the game for you, but if you want a game that lets you experience the visceral action of medieval combat then this game will give you hours of enjoyment.",1
"Bottom line up front (BLUF): This game is to Doom 3 what Doom 2 was to Doom 1.   Pros: -This game doesn't treat you like an idiot with tons of unwanted tutorials, you get straight into the action -SP Campaign is suprisingly open and incentives exploring -Constant moving is required to stay alive and keeps the action high speed and intense -MP is fun enough, but it's not going to redefine anything (I would've prefered no loadouts though) -Graphics are superb (though I'm playing on the highest settings for everything)  -SnapMap is pretty awesome and have already lost myself for hours making maps -Codexes provide an interesting and funny look at the DOOM world  Cons:  -For some reason the control settings for SP, MP, and SnapMap are all different. Minor inconvenince -As stated, MP should've been more like Unreal or classic Doom -No server browser for MP or SnapMap (not an big issue in MP, but is kind of annoying for SnapMap -It came to an end  Random Musings: -Some elements in my SnapMap maps haven't worked correctly, still not sure if that's my fault or if there is another error going on -Coop is only in SnapMap, not the campaign (apparently people are confused about the way Steam is advertising that) -I wish SnapMap would allow for the SP ability to have all the weapons in the game (might be a way to do that, just haven't found it yet)  Summary: If you are already a fan of the Doom series, you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a shooter that is a ton of fun, buy this game. If you are a fan of CoD multiplayer, I'm not sure I would recommend it. Hell, even fans of CoD SP might not like it, as you have to constantly be moving and there is no health regeneration (though Glory Kills provide a VERY fun way to recover health and armor, chainsaw kills do the same for ammo). If you are on the fence, buy this game. I give you my word you will not be disappointed.  ",1

"Bioshock, Little Sisters and Rapture... You're thinking of these terms when someone mentions the game. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played.  You have a story line that can be expanded with tape recorders or you follow the normal one.  Much can't be sayed about the story without a spoiler BUT I can say it's suprising and the end is not what you're expecting ;)  You can explore REALLY, really big levels with secrets, many enemies and loot. They are beautiful designed and the view out of rapture....Deep in the sea on the ground with fishes swimming about your head and glowing plants. Do I need to say more?  The combat system is..well you get used to it but at the beginning it's confusing. They are so many ways to use weapons or Plasmids (magic abilities) so everyone can probably find an own system to fight against the thousands of splicers and big daddys.  The thing I liked very much was that you choose the end. So tell me will it be good or evil XD???  PLAY it, BUY IT it's absolutely worth and it's INCREDIBLE, AWESOME and BEAUTIFUL! &lt;3",1

It is a game full of potential -- beautiful graphics, excellent voice acting, and a seldomly explored subject matter tied together with a commercially proven gaming formula. Yet, while 'Freedom Cry' was not horrible, it was not stellar or impressive as it should be. What we got is a game with a partially developed character, about whom I actually want to learn more, in a half-baked story that felt like 'Assassin's Creed' Lite.  It was innovative to play as a slave-turned-Assassin, who despite having gifts and talents bestowed upon him by the Brotherhood, still needed to be weary of slave jailers because of the colour of his skin. This was enough to change the usual pace of an 'Assassin's Creed' game, and I quite enjoyed that. Not needing to deal with modern day Abstergo/Animus story elements was also very welcomed, but it was odd to see the concept of synchronicity being left in the game. The modern day story elements in 'Assassin's Creed' had always felt like Ubisoft lacked confidence in a loosely historical third-person stealth action game. 'Freedom Cry' would have been the perfect opportunity for the franchise to distant itself from this extraneous story element, but that chance was unfortunately wasted.  My biggest complaint about 'Freedom Cry', is the naval combat. As someone who had not played 'Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag', I found the learning curve for naval warfare to be steep. There wasn't much of a tutorial and it took much trial and error for me to fully understand the basic mechanics. Plus, there was one mission that would have been difficulty to complete if I had not fully upgraded my ship through constant pirating. Such level grinding has no place in a game like 'Freedom Cry' as it slowed the entire game down. That and the repetitiveness and general lack of mission variety made the game rather tedious at times. Seriously, how many eavesdropping missions did 'Freedom Cry' really need for a nine-mission game?   The theme of slavery is both a shining factor and a major weakness of 'Freedom Cry'. I got much satisfaction freeing slaves in the game, but when the number of slaves I freed became the currency of weapon upgrades eligibility, I became frustrated. Shouldn't I be freeing slaves because it is the right thing to do and because it is the main character's motivation, not because of a weapon upgrade? Plus, why would black merchants, who knew I free slaves, only sell me weapons if I meet a quota? This game mechanic, while thematically important, was not very well thought out and well implemented.  For those who have played 'Black Flag', 'Freedom Cry' may appeal to you, but for those who haven't, your time may be better spent on other games than this somewhat mediocre entry to the 'Assassin's Creed' franchise.",-1
[Spoilers] -----As someone with aspergers this hit really close to home. This game is probobly #1 or 2 on my all time favorite games now. Very well done,1
"One of the best games i ever played, memories..",1
"This game is amazing! I would definently reccomend this to another person! This is where the spoilers start, so if you dont want to be spoiled stop reading.    Alright, i warned you.

"The people overating abt the lags and graphics never ever go after a game which has just released thats what I have learned. I waited for year now I got all updates and game runs really smooth on my PC.   Yes eveything about batman series is great.  Graphics 8 /10 Gameplay 10/10 Story 10/10  Very sad though that this series has ended, Hope New batman will take place and a new series will soon come.",1

Very Good.,1
"The Banner Saga is perhaps one of the most beautiful artistic games that I have ever played. Add onto that with beautiful music and amazing character development.  I won't spoil the story, but I do assure you that the story is amazing in it's own way, while the story does have some decision making, it's both impactful and unexpected. Some 'good' choices that you might've made might be bad choices later on, or vice versa. It's really hard to tell. So pay close attention to dialouge and situations that will leave characters either dead, your caravan short-handed on a few fighters and varls, or the worse part supplies.  The combat in this game takes notes from other combat sequences with this style. But makes it more 'simpler' and easy for the player to understand. Just keep an eye on your morale and survey the battlefield before charging head on. You can 'upgrade' the characters stats and do 'trainning' scenarios to further your understanding of possible combat scenarios. However, what could've been useful is for the game to allow us to make this trainning combat scenarios ourselves rather than being pre-selected. What's more is that, nothing reallly comes out of trainning.   Lastly. And this might be a personal gripe. Or it could be something players had asked before. But there is no 'save' feature in the options screen. The only way you can save is by making camp. While it might serve a purpose, or it's on players shoulders for paying close attention. Whatever the case maybe. It would be nice to have the actually ability to re-role some of our choices through manual saves.  And seeing how there is a sequel already and (to my belief) no further plans for updating the game. Hopefully, when or if a Banner Saga 3 comes along. I hope Stoic considers a 'manual save' feature.  Other than that, The Banner Saga itself is a must have for anyone who likes artistic and visual effort. And a bit of simplistic but overall gripping edge with a game.",1
"Tried to play through hard mode, god destroyed. 10/10 would lose again.",1
A fun and good game based on movement with a grappling hook and super jumps. A few tricky sections but deaths are quick and painless. The plot hits like a truck out of nowhere at the very end.,1
"This was much more heart warming than I expected, I only played the Karin route but wow it was way better than I expected. Short and sweat story with enjoyable charcters, it gets a bonus from me for being clean as well.",1
3 Words.  You ♥♥♥♥ potatos?,1
"This game is a nice little city builder.  The actual gameplay itself is at first quite unforgiving, you forget to make a tailor early on then people freeze to death in the winter, you forget to set up enough foresters then there is not enough firewood and people freeze to death in winter, you fail to set up crop feilds... etc but once you remedy each one of these programs and learn at what point you prioritise them the game becomes too easy.   I actually had a bit on fun on this one, it has some interesting building designs that remind me of either skyrim or some places in game of thrones, however the charm of the design soon becomes a bit bland and the whole village looks a bit stock.   I would say that the strategy tag is a bit of a reach to be honest. And the survival, well it is but soon you are sitting on a stockpile of food and resources so large that its not so much survival as what should I do next. That is not to say its not worth a look, I would probably wait until it is on sale or something and for a few hours fun it would definatly be worth the time.   The tutorials are pretty good and tell you more or less everything you need to know, but the game itself seems to lack any sort of campaign, so its more a kind of sandbox city builder.   I put not reccomened but that doesn't mean I didnt enjoy my time on this game, it has a lot to offer and I would pick it up if you are really into city builders and you would probably sink a few hours and then like me...unfortunatly leave it alone after that.  By no means dissapointing, but needs more if it's ever to gain reccomemdation",-1
"Good game. Decent graphics. Easy to play alone, but more fun with a buddy. Definitely helpful to team up for the big challenges.",1
It is fun enough said,1
the new update has made my in play sound go all odd can anyone help,-1
"I bought it cheap with money I got from trading cards, but it doesn't work so...",-1

"if you like CoD , probably worth 30 €",1
"As a long-term Souls fan (played and finished all Dark Souls games), I feel quite confident telling you this:  Dark Souls 3 is the WORST game in the series. By far! I found about 70 bugs in just one playthrough - graphical glitches, terrible game breaking bugs, ♥♥♥♥ed up hit detection on certain terrains and so on. It is not an enjoyable Souls Game by any stretch of your imagination. PvP and PvE are both terrible (duels are somehow enjoyable if your ping is, like, 20-30), but the ♥♥♥♥ multi-phantom preference when you invade really takes the crown here. Ever wanted to fight 3 v 1? No? Oh my my! Too bad for you! Poise doesn't exist for you (but does for enemies. Good luck with that heavy weapon or paired swords. Really) and the hyper armour in this game seemingly stops working by a second.   Didn't want to believe my friends when they told me to not buy DS3 because I will be terribly disappointed. And, honestly, I enjoyed the start, all the way to Pontiff. But, frankly, bosses are blank and boring and so are the enemies.  Just as I've been told, Dark Souls 3 is definitely NOT the best entry into the series. Not worth the full price I paid for it. And, frankly, I wouldn't even make it past the 20 hours mark if I wasn't cooping with a friend.   In short, if you want something similar to Dark Souls/Dark Souls 2, do NOT buy this game. Literally half the things you expect from a Souls game doesn't work here. Or doesn't exist, in the better case. Bad game. Uninstalled and never going to play again. Instead, I'll add another 50 hours to the 210 I have on DS2 or re-play Dark Souls for the fifth time with my bud. It's much better.",-1
I totally love this game and the whole idea of it. The only complaint I have is after level 10 and you go to the desert looking zone I had a rough time making it through due to massive respawns. Other then that this game is a 10 out of 10. Love the crafting system,1
"Why the hell is it going to be $30, make it $10",1
"Really fun, cute and brutal survival game. You start off with nothing and no knowledge of anything. As you explore, experiment and die you learn the intricacies of the game. Very interesting and addicitve!",1
"Well apart from getting motion sickness every time I play, It's an absolutely amazing game, polished without being high-draw, and enough content without drowning the player.",1
This was an amazing game I thought i did not fnish the campaign but i finished it in 5 hours I was so happy. Spoiler Alert! : I killed Sheapard at the end. 100000000/10,1
"If you love old 2D Dos platformers similar to the old Duke Nukem games, then this indie game is for you :D",1
10/10 76 hours in and I got my player walking 4 feet,1
It's fun if you're playing with friends..,1
Addicting,1
"The story has many changing points and has some really good surprising moments and shocking truth for us all (like Deponia and The night of the rabbit).  The graphics are not so my style (miss a bit more details) but at the end they worked really good for the whole game (overseeing movements that arent important for me) and the parts splitscreen reminds me on XIII a bit but decide yourself with the trailers/ screenshots and sound too.  Because of this really important message the game has, the challenging puzzles (you can skip after a short time or use help) and the moment you dont expect i give this game 98 % for point and click fans. I hope you enjoy this game like me (maybe you want buy the game with 33 % or more discount).   P. S. i was kicked 1 time out the game at the end where you only chose the dialogs but thx auto save i waste maybe 1 min and then at the end i skip all texts and the part i kicked out with ESC. Sad that some players have problems to start the game :(",1
"Game is so boring. Same missions, same enemy models, your main target its farming equipment in pvp zone, forget about storyline. Thank you Ubi for one more piece of s***.",-1
"☑ Overall amazing game! ☑ Co-op in all chapters including DLC ☑ Two sexy lead characters (Chris &amp; Sheva) ☑ Excella ☑ Mercenaries, No Mercy &amp; Reunion ☑ Versus ☑ Rotten Eggs!  What's not to like?",1
"Too hard, I keep dropping my tools and I can't get them out of my patient!",-1
"let it be known that this game is hard as ♥♥♥♥, and might as well be a puzzle game where one wrong move means reloading your last save point.  XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game that takes place 20 years after the events of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It's story is so simple and linear that it can be summed up in one sentence: you have to liberate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ planet from aliens. the in-game content, however, makes up for so much of what the story lacks, and fleshes out the post-ADVENT-takeover world through lively character dialogue and ♥♥♥♥-loads of texts.  the gameplay is easy to pick up and hard to master, forcing you to adapt to and anticipate the ever-changing variables that keep the game fast-paced and intense for a turn-based. you'll find yourself re-loading previous turns as the game pits you against literally overwhelming odds. you'll also find yourself looking up guides on the internet and cursing loudly at the RNG and the 'how the ♥♥♥♥ was i supposed to know that' moments.  the downsides about this game are that aiming, character animations, and camera does get clunky at times, and in my experience, the game gets laggier as you progress. but it could be just me. aside from the irrational difficulty of the game, however, XCOM 2 is respectable and a challenge for lovers of strategy games.  however, i don't recommend it with full price with all its technical imperfections. the story mode is too short and the replayability value comes from either installing external mods or running through the game with harder difficulties, which studies have shown to correlate with shortening your lifespan.",1
Well what can I say this game is such an smiple phyics game made perfect awsome idea for an game ! I really seem to like this game epic as it gets plus u can play with ps 4 player .. ill give this game a 10/10,1
"Despite what people say about this game being addicting, I see this game as a few easy achievements. Honestly, after you get a few good heros, you just run the game in the background, collecting money and achievements.",1
"First i want to start by saying the price for the DLC is pretty outrageuos, that being said i did not let that discourage me from getting this game. I consider myself a big fan of strategy games like Civilition 5 and Age of Empires, but their came a point were those games just stopped being challenging to me due to a lack in the depth of stretgy needed. This game however changed that for me, with the real time battle system it makes you ffel like an actyual general as you move your troops around responding to the enemy and having to use actual military battle tactics to anihalate the opponent. More over this game provided me with a much needed challenge that i found lacking in other strategy games. All in all i would say this game is worth the by if you are a strategy fan, and if it is on sale do not pass it up!  Pros:  -difficult -open modding community -army variation -hours of fun -online multiplayer -every game is diffrent  Cons: -cost of the DLC  -lack of the abillity to take any territory not linked to you or the enemy faction ( there is a mod that can change that) -it can sometimes be difficult to conferate a faction ( not that bad cause you can just conquer them)  Once again if this game is on sale or if you are just a huge strategy game fan like me dont pass this game up!!!!!",1
SHIOK AHHHH althought got some bugs,1
"This game is absolutely awesome, puzzles, storyline and developers humour are just great.  (The only issue I had with it was some of the menu's didnt load text and I had to change to the 'oldversion')",1
I cant in good faith recommend this game. I just love the Bartman Story... I just eat it all up. On the other hand this game plays like a sports car in a mudd pull race. It just stutters like insanely. Driving is a mess when your framerate drops for no reason . This game just seems like it was badly optimized. The game looks stunning in 4K. I mean stunning as in OMG its a masterpiece but whats the point if even at lower resolutions your immersion gets taken away by frame drops and stuttering when playing it... It is a good looking game but it plays like garbage and i have a pretty good machine ( i can play most games maxed 4K ) This game plays smoothly before it just dips down and stutters like hell. Rocksteady should feel ashame of this game.... selling people a broken game. No one remembers history huh.... keep selling broken games and watch the game market take a dip..... making mistakes like this and history has a habbit of repeating itself......game market crash!!!,-1
"Getting co-op to work in this game is a nightmare. I downloaded it because it said 'co-op', spent fifteen minutes being confused and researching how to get it to work, then another ten learning about port forwarding and enabling DMZ hosting in my router's advanced settings, then uninstalled it.  It's 2016. No one wastes their time on games that are hard to get running anymore.",-1
"Don't buy this game for its singleplayer content. The AI is dumber than a sack of hammers inside a sack of bricks.  Buy this game to play with three buddies, because then it's going to be a whole load of fun, horrible balance issues aside.",1
"Game is very calm and repetitive but there is nothing wrong with that, this game is amazing just graphically and audibly. Definitely not a game for someone looking for action 24/7 but good for a relaxed fun time.",1
Good babystep for H1Z1.,1
"Love this game, and it keeps getting better with the awesome modding community.",1
"Had high expectations for this game (multiplayer) after Bo2, extremely dissapointed. Unbalanced, lots of bullsh*t, so on and so forth. For anyone wanting a good multiplayer game i either reccomend CS:GO or BF4.",-1
This game is fun but it sucks that you can barely get guns and stuff because it's buy to play.,1
"This game is the game that heals all of your ills. As a matter of fact, the famous book 'Chicken Soup for the Soul' was a metaphor for this game. Most people downrate this game for forcing you to pay after level 10. But, what they dont realize is that with this game, you don't need a college education, or food, or a social life. No, gentlemen, let your beards grow long as you whittle away your hours being amazing, oddly-colored animals wearing no clothes.  On the downside, there was a lack of quickscoping ability in this game, so I was unable to get a 'triple'. But, you can still be pretty 1337 if you so desire.  Everyone, prepare your butts, because it's about to be slam time when you enter this new money sucking creation from the makers of Webkinz, the reason your parents couldn't afford food when you were younger. But, that's alright, because your soul will be filled with childish joy that you only experience when you are a young boy after successfully entering a random activation code for a Webkinz doll, knowing that you just ruined someone else's day.  To summarize, this game will blow you away. This game will change you as a person. This game has more change than the Obama administration.  3hunna/10 GOTY 2014",1

I love your games but this blanket ban wave hitting many legit players is RIDICULOUS! I'm deleted my previous character, started another one...and still got banned! :/ get your ♥♥♥♥ together!",-1
This game could never even start. as it said it had a issue with a Nvidia GTX760 card not being reconized. Then all the Direct X functions in the game had issues also in trying to start. So all I ever saw was crashes to desktop. Thank god I only wasted my money during a sale and didn't pay full price.,-1

"Very disappointed and frustrated by this game, ive played many other total war games and loved them, but this one seems to have drained the fun out of the game and made unit and city management awkward and frustrating. The combat system is annoying, cavalry and archers seem to have been weakened really badlly making them almost not worth having. The limits on the amount of buildings and armies you can have is annoying as well, seeing as they had never done this in any of the previous titles because it would make the game... less fun... so why do it?",-1

"Among the Sleep is a great short horror game. Even though I didn't find it too scary, I found the atmosphere to be very tense and enjoyed it all the same. The game is original in the aspect that it is from the perspective of a toddler, which is what grabbed my attention as someone who doesn't play horror games. My main complaint is that the game is seriously short; I completed the game in around 2 hours, which is unnacceptable given its price tag. Wait for this game to go on sale before buying.

"This is a fine game. It isn't a very in depth fighting game, but it offers a nice experience in going through Dragon Ball Z's most iconic moments with your own character. That's a plus for me. It's fun, it has enough of that novelty to keep me playing. I do feel like it lacks some character customisation features, however. Having to contantly imagine a tail on my Saiyan is something that could have easily been solved with a customisation option, considering that they already have fully animated Saiyan tails in game already. That aside, there's a lot of content to keep you busy and as a Dragon Ball fan, you might enjoy it. As an average player, it may not be for you. There is another problem, though. I don't like how they handled obtaining items and attacks. The RNG gods control the RNG kings who manage the RNG council, who may or may not give you the item you want after 100,000 times of perfecting a mission and fulfilling every requirement of getting said item. If you have patience, you can have them.",1

I'm an Oddworld fanboy and Stranger's Wrath was one of the games I missed out on when I still had my consoles. But I am glad I waited. Great game. Saying anything else would spoil such a game. Only gripe i have is the weird controller settings and how easy to miss the sniper bugs. 7/10,1

"Edit: Several months after release and many patches later, the game is finally in a stable and enjoyable state for single player gamers like me.  The improvements: 1. Offline play works. No need to worry about poor internet connection to Uber servers. 2. Save finally works. And with the latest updates, it even supports rewind. 3. Campaign now makes more sense. 4. Pause and give order is now better. 5. More units and more varies statregies.  Surely it is not yet Supreme commander forged alliance calibre, but it is a good game in itself now. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original review follows: This game is supposedly in Gamma state, yet it is far from completion (best case) or simply unplayable (worst case if the final is anything like this).  First, all single player games require internet connection all the time. Worst yet, every order must be sent to server in order to register. As a result, the game lags beyond description for me. It is simply unplayable if your connection to the servers are not that good. (FYI, there seems to be servers in US and Australia, so if you live in other countries, be aware).  Second, where is the save game feature? How do I tell the orders I give in pause mode? There are so many obvious problems in the first game.  Supreme commander looks, feels and plays much better than this. Even total annihilation is better. Avoid this game now.",1
"Optimization is horrible. I have an octa core and the cpu usage never dips over 30%. This causes my graphics card usage to never go over 30% as well. Good game, poor optimization.

I would definitely recommend anyone to play this even if your not a real fan of puzzle games just play it if you haven't (seriously if you didn't play this then what's wrong with you).",1
"great game exactly what i was looking for, but a bit expensive when the dlc will bring total cost to around the same as a big new release title eg totalwars; and this just dosnt have the content or the depth for the price. for those after the pure panzer turnbased stratagy experiance this is the ♥♥♥♥ gott mit uns",1
i cant run it on my computer at all and its only fun with friends,-1
i recommend it BUT YOU NEED A CONTROLLER OR ELSE THIS GAME IS HARDER THAN IT SHOULD BE!!! but other than that the art style and the level design is amazing.,1
This is one of those games I come back to often just to have some fun. The huge updates make for a nice refresh of content and make hunting for new things fun.,1
great software if you have a vive you should Definitely buy it.,1

"[I got the game with the mid-week madness sale. So after i played Prison Architect, which is also a great game, i played this game.] Great game. I really had the feeling, of being a real hacker, from the first second of the game. You think, you have to watch out of being tracked and to pay fees to other companies. So the game is really for someone, who understand how the Internet,LAN,Proxies and all that works. Others should watch a video, and then think about purchasing, or not. [I'm from Germany by the way..^^ So please tell me your opinion to that review.]",1

"11/10 would buy a free to play 45$ and charge 15$ every month for two weapons and one skin I will never unlock because I need to GRIND TO GET WHAT I BOUGHT WITH MY MONEY.  I paid to steal money not to get my money stolen, something obviously went wrong.",-1
Very fun and addictive.,1
"It's a bit buggy and I have to do the annoying '-nofbo' command or whatever at the beginning to get it to actually start up, but other than that it's been great playing this game again!! Really fun stuff, highly recommended with the updated HD graphics too!! :D",1
Awesome single player experience. Once start the campaign it's hard to stop. Moves easier to execute compare to Mortal Kombat too. Suits those who like a casual playing experience rather than some highly skilled-based fighting game like Street Fighter or King of Fighters.   Get it if you're a fan of superheroes genre too.. worth every cent on sales.. like srsly..,1
'PASS THE WHISKEY' 11/5 IGN,1
"More then 12 years, and it's still going strong! One of the best management games (if not THE best, maybe together with TTD) ever made! I really cannot recommend this one enough!  10/10 Play it, again!",1
"This is a really great game. It's simple yet complex at the same time. It allows for many different playstyles and has many routes to go. And with the many many mods out there, this game has so much potential. This game is especially worth the wait for their up oming bannerlord.",1
"It is objectifying and dirty. 10/10 it's okay  Actually more like 6/10 but maybe like a high 6, especially if you get it on a nice sale and are in the mood for a clicking game that you could probably finish in a couple of days.  Also by playing this with the Steam controller, I can just have one of the triggers set to rapid fire perpetual click and burn through all the clicking by just holding odwn the trigger. It's like magic!  Warning, there's no actual nudity in this game.",1
this ♥♥♥♥ is the ♥♥♥♥. lol brings back all the fun of dueling it out in job corps except i get to smoke weed while i play lol. there is a glitch with save games though so make sure to dissable steam cloud sync unless you like wasting your time.,1
"This game... It's... OK. I've only played a set few game-modes, but the ones I have played can go either way. If this wasn't just a multi-player game, I'd probably like it more. Just spawning things, RP, and shooting people can only last for so long.",-1
I take thing serious And you take 'em light you go to bed early And I party all night Our friends are sayin' We ain't gonna last Cuz I move slowly And baby I'm fast I like it quiet And I love to shout But when we get together It just all works out  I take--2 steps forward I take--2 steps back We come together Cuz opposites attract And you know--it ain't fiction Just a natural fact We come together Cuz opposites attract   ohh yeaaaa,1
"Great way to bring the Max Payne series into the modern Third Person Shooter era, while still feeling like a legit sequel. Loved the style and story even more than the first one.",1
"A very guarded thumbs-up: nothing awesomely innovative, but it can hit that just-one-more-turn like a good TBS.  The developers have improved AI balance from early reviews: Easy really isn't hard once you learn the game systems, but on higher difficulty levels I've been out-teched, I've been zerged, I've seen one AI militarily dominate two others while I'm playing a turtley game and then become economically unbeatable.  Downsides, to me: * the midgame twist can get a bit samey, or be a little too highly random - sometimes I have to absorb 80% of the impact, other times I never see a single infestation. * it seems like it invites just a little more micromanagement than I'm interested in doing; if I'm rebalancing population allocations every time a city grows it slows down enough to lose my interest. Civ has the same kind of friction in high-level play, though, so this shouldn't be too surprising. * the technology *order* is random, but you get access to every technology every game, and I haven't seen a time after the first 50-100 turns where changing the depth of a tech in the tree made a huge difference. Perhaps this becomes more of an issue with high-difficulty slow-game-speed play? At standard speed and low to mid tech, I've never been able to have a default technology build order, but I've been able to find a standard preferred set of troop types and usually deploy the same kinds for most of the game.",1
A must to play for any Elder Scrolls fan,1

"The first game was great. I could not see how this could become nothing else but just a lackluster sequel. Oh boy, did I get that wrong. This is a must if you have played the first season. There is plenty of new characters that are mostly likable but it's amazing to see how our Clementine has grown so mature over the years. This game will punch you in the feels, just like the first one did.",1
"Evolve is a game that I was very excited about when I first found out about it, but was pretty much completely destroyed by poor development plans EVERYWHERE. I would have loved to play it before f2p but never wanted to even think about spending all that money. Now that it is f2p, besides the fact that it sounds like everyone who used to play got screwed out of what they had, I actually find this game to be a lot of fun. Going f2p is awesome because I can now have fun playing it, but not worry about wasting my money.",1
"a lot of ppl are complaining about not offering IAP(in app purchase) who needs that? cant out smart the AI? strategy is the key. -Ai's dont just run at u. if seen by you yes they will engage you. the ones u dont see move to corners wait to counter you &amp; get close as they can in the dark so they have AP to get within attacking range next round.  ^[(THE BAD)]^ about playing &amp; starting the game on normal the ai's arent that strong so killing them wont be hard. 7missions in &amp; not that tuff tbh. but thats why theres different difficultys. -NOW GRAPHICS i think the graphics are good,any detail u see on while upgrading ur space marine u see those details while playing and battling.  - map coloring is smooth can see all the little textures &amp; lighting there -battling animation is on point(shooting &amp; sword impaling), space marines have auto convo's during missions interesting, -music is well played. - before u start ur missions your space marines are all next to each other lined up, u can swap out to change one another or do upgrades which they look very bad ♥♥♥ before u start ur mission.  -love the traits they have tons of abilities and passives &amp; weapons  -lvling up u have to choose between health,accuracy &amp; crit chance. this makes building the best space marine diffcult they are all started differently, which is fun.  -Tons of marines to unlock cards are based on TIERS 1-4 raritiy. get booster packs after each mission 3 cards per pack. dont be fooled by the bad reviews. game is something new and fun   the bad &amp; not the good -battling maps are a little small  -have to beat the game to change the difficulty,didnt like that -not sure if this is bad but diffinetly challenging so,if Magnus has 2k exp before the mission to use for upgrades and u fail the mission,u loose those 2k exp points and start at zero. now if u used those xp points before the mission and unlocked an ability with it. u loose nothing. really something to consider before going into battle. -Price is a bit high $25 was on sale when released for $22.50. $15 usd would be fair without a doubt in my opinion. hope to see some DLC's in the feature  THE GOODS 7PTS &amp; the BADS 4PTS 8-10 in my book proud owner of  WARHAMMER 40K DEAHWATCH  FIGHT FOR THE EMPEROR!

"It has a lot going for it but if it wasn´t for the dumby dumb dumb ai of the hostages and the questionable logic of your teammates it would be excelent. Seriously, i tell my team to breach and clear an open area and 5 times out of 10 they stannd near the door. The hostages? they run into gunfire. Luckily the hostages dont do that so often.   Final Score: 6.5/10",1
"Beaten the game three times, and it doesn't get old. This one is a must for any library. My desire to write my own games is heavly influenced by this one.",1
Nice game to play and enjoy,1
"If you like zombie games and have Half Life 2 installed, this game is wonderfully amazing.",1
"Pretty good time waster. I find myself playing this every time I'm bored.   Once you're used to the game mechanics for survival, the goal changes into 'what can I do this time?'. I've done 26 out of 30 achievements and have around 100+ hours on this game.   The game could use a polish here and there but it's a great city builder/survival game that I definitely recommend.",1
Quite possibly as addictive as Populous.,1
"This is the first game I've ever 'Not recommended' Why? Well, It's just like the previous 3, yes. And I love 1 and 2 and I think 3 is ok. It is made by one guy, which is impressive. You have doors, Yeah. I'll admit, spooky game. So why do I hate if it's got the good points of the old FNAFs?  Well, there is something I hate about this game. It's just gone so stale and it has no reason to exist. Infact, I could sum up FNAF since FNAF 2 in one word. 'Overkill' The constant talk of FNAF is just irritating, the youtube homescreen filled with 'OMG A F***ING TOP HAT FNAF 5 CONFIRMED' or 'OMG A DOOR MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT IT' and 'I PRETEND TO SCREAM AT FREDDY FAZBEAR' with the constant top 10's and theorys of everything that has to do with FNAF just decayed the entire series for me.  The game itself is just boring. We've been clicking doors and flicking lights for a year now. Can't we have something new now? I wouldn't of minded waiting much longer for a game that is original and fresh and not the same game for the 4th time. And like i've been reminded by my comments '0.3 HOURS IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUDGE THIS GAME' Let me put it to you this way. If I took you to a farm and pointed you towards some cow poo, how long would it take to recognize that what i'm pointing at is poo? about 1 or 2 seconds. The same goes for FNAF 4. 0.3 hours of game time is WAY beyond the ammount of time to recognize that this is poo. I guess if you're new to the series then, and you are insane, I guess buy this one (But if you want to play a GOOD fnaf game, get 1 or 2..) However for me, who's been with FNAF since the start, this game was disappointing.  I've grown a hatred to this game. No, not the whole FNAF series (It's not fair to blame all of them because one of them is bad) just this disaster of a game.  When anyone mentions FNAF 4, I have to hold back the rant of this game. Watching paint dry is better than this game. (This is the part of the review I skipped where I do the events of me playing FNAF in chronological order but... they're so bad and boring)  I was ready for Nightmare Freddy, I managed to escape with a couple of clicks, and, Oh hey! I got £5.59! ($8.73) ($8.79 canadian)",-1
"I remember playing Skyrim, and finding that Dragons were by far some of the most annoying things after a while. Thought they would never stop attacking. Then I met cliff Racers.",1

"WHAT A DEAL!!! I got this game when it was free on Humble Bundle and WOW! from the first moment you are pulled into the game like a Gravitational Anomaly in S.T.AL.K.E.R. In the first half an hour of gameplay you will be down to your last bullet (Which you are almost certain to miss since your adrenaline is near cardiac arrest levels) and desperatly searching for new gas filters for your mask, or a new mask for that matter because the one you are wearing is broken. This game has a great storyline that leaves you hungry for more when the credits start rolling.  The thing I think that should be crucial for any survival game is being forced to not only take down beast more powerful than you, but the need to make every shot count while you do it. This game does that. Before long you will be making sure every shotgun pellet hits that mutants face. You try as hard as you can to hold on to any military grade bullet you have since it is the primary currency in the game (One high quality 5.45mm round for five low quality, or two 12 guage, as well as new weapons and other supplies). The homemade style of a lot of the weapons is like icing on top of a cake. The attention to detail is fantastic.  For me the only drawback in this game the Protagonist Artyoms voice over is a bit flat in the cutscenes (english version). There isn't anything else I could fault with this game.  9/10 This is a must have so don't hesitate.",1
10/10 Would play more,1
"Very nice looking artwork, although some death scenes are a little disturbing for me. :-)",1

"Good game, I like it. I have one negative for this. The Match-Making is verry slow, but try it. Easy control, diferent weapons,shield,ships type.",1
"One of my absoulte favourite first-person titles of all time. A well-crafted combination of Half Life, Thief and Mirror's Edge combining into a unique blend of stealth, action and storytelling unlike any other game. Audiovisually impeccable, Dishonored let's you explore and be amazed by it's architechture, and it's characters, while not necessarily the smartest in gaming history, are some of the most colourful and well-acted I've ever seen.  To top things off, I'll make an exception to my usual 'no DLC ever' -policy and recommend the two story DLC packs for this game as well. Neither of the DLC's alone is much, but together they weave into the story of the main game and fill the player in on one of the least fleshed out, yet most important characters in the game.  My only gripe is the passivity of the protagonist, Corvo, as his fall during a certain point in the game feel far too forced. Still, this game comes highly recommended, despite a minor gripe here or there.  Playtime: 25+ hours (single playthrough, including DLC)  Ratings (1-10) Visual: 10 Audio: 10 Story: 9 Gameplay: 9 Overall: 9",1
10/10 would rip off own arm and beat opponent with it again,1
"This game is actually quite a good title, i find the gameplay is quite enjoyable and mostly it's challenging.",1
I am very please with the game. It is fun and technically solid.,1
"I feel sorry for most of the people giving bad reviews of this game. No Man's Sky has turned out to be exactly what I expected, nothing more, nothing less.  It is true that the game is not optimised as best as it could be but I am sure that this is something they are working on. I can happily accept that as in the past I have paid more money for games that have had hundreds of people working on them just for it to run extremely poor. All I can give is my own opinion and currently I haven't had any problems with crashes, etc. C'mon guys! Update those drivers.  The look, feel and sound of this game really add to the immersion of it all. The eerie lonliness of it all is fantastic and a very welcome break from the constant full throttle AAA stuff that is curned out every year. The sound deserves a second mention because it is really fantastic the way it seemlesly changes depending on the sitatuation.  If you are complaining about what this game is, or rather what it isn't (multiplayer). Then more fool you, sir. More fool you. It was never 100% clear that this game would be multiplayer and you could soooo easily tell from the way Sean and Hello Games talked about it that it definitely wasn't going to be a full multiplayer experience (people hanging out, exploring together). It was never meant to be that game, maybe it will be in the future.  For now though I am having a rad time blasting off through the universe, making all sorts of friends with our alien brethren and just enjoying the beautiful experience that it is.",1
So good I bought it twice!,1
10/10 better than call of duty and battlefield.,1
"Reminds me of Zelda on SNES and turn-based strag in an rpg.  87cent, fun side scroller zelda-ish with turn-based strag with a darkness eating up everything on the left side, only one way to go and thats RIGHT.

"EDIT 11/3016 It's okay.  My review for KF1 can be seen here:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/1250    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=690944613  6/1/16: This game is a wolf in sheeps clothing. It's not a game in Alpha it's just a finished game with no content. Not only that but my hunch that they didn't know what they wanted turned out to be true. The developers are banning users for negative reviews or asking about updates. And have even started censoring the Steam forum and following users to see where they talk about the game so they can ban them, slow updates,not fixing glaring issues,bad performance(I have a GTX 980 SC ACX 2.0, and i7 4790k Devils Canyon and 16 gigs of ram.), nasty aliasing, PvP instead of new maps or perks (wtf?),charging users for crossover DLC that's free for the users of the other crossed over game in question, broken or unbalanced classes, lack of guns and the little amount of maps which are also not very good. Where London? ♥♥♥♥ it avoid it.  4/9/16: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Tripwire just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right off. Get the original Killing Floor even though it's loaded with DLC, 'dated visuals' (They don't bother me) and an annoyingly crappy server system at least you will be able to run it smoothly (I have a GTX 980 SC ACX 2.0, and i7 4790k Devils Canyon and 16 gigs of ram.) and wont be buried by a wave of microtransactions and isn't an unfinished game with no end goal or completion in site in sight. That and you'll be able to get all the DLC seeing as they wont be making anymore for Killing Floor. I predict this game will take 6 years to be completed but thats if they really working on it.  12/4/15: Well after a long wait it's still not finished yet it has MICROTRANSACTIONS! I'm REALLY glad I bought the deluxe edition which means I don't get any extra content. Wait what? And if it's in early access why are you selling new content to us?  OLD Positive Review: Like Killing Floor 1 but with most the perks missing and random recoil. Still fun but I would wait for them to add WAYYY more content.",-1
"its an extreamly fun game, when it works. Its still in beta and it will crash on the loading screen for me now and Ive reinstalled everything... But its extreamly fun when I could play it.  My only beef besides not being able to launch it is the game desperatly needs class and level balance. A match making/w party system is also desperatly needed. Even with thoes massive flaws Im eager to play it again I hope the support gets back to me soon.",1

"Interface a little clunky and annoying at times, but if you're looking for a good western shooter that is surprisingly in depth, you've found it. Also, it's free, so there's really no reason not to pick it up.",1
" Absolutely brilliant continuation to the franchise! Executed very well unlike most triple A titles today. I would recommend it at this current time and, without a doubt, later on too. My hours say it all for this game. I've already found myself checking the time at the start and it being 4:00 pm and then checking a couple of hours later and then what do I know, my alarm's going off at 10:00 am. I cannot deny the fact that this game still continues its 'Just One More Turn' idea.   People are often comparing this game to Civilization V a lot which is bad. This game, from what I can tell, is the best bits from each Civilization compiled into one, as well as a few improvements that haven't been attempted before, to make the best Civilization game yet. I believe this has been done fantastically!   Lots of Features means more Replayability",1

"This Human-Hunting simulation is a breath of fresh-air, when set against the depressingly high number of 'pro-human/anti-robot' video games. I know it's just anthropomorphism , but you can almost imagine how it would be to be one of those fleshy bags as it runs vainly hither and thither. They plainly enjoy it just as much as we do. But when will the developers let us play as a robot, as the roboGod intended?",1

"Ok, coming from me, the original FPS fan, this is AMAZING. I'm only a few hours in, but this game is everything I wanted and more. This is worth the money - I feel like some ID really put some serious thought and effort into making an enjoyable game.  Pros: Some truly uncomfortable horror scenes, compelling story, well-developed characters, highly destructible dynamic environments, satisfying gore, action straight out of a 80's Ahnold movie, and special effects worth writing home about. You will not get bored playing this game - it's clear that a lot of thought went into it. It even has a 'lite' stealth system and accompanying choices of how to strategically approach each situation. It also doesn't hold your hand through every individual scenario ala Call Of Duty (and this is coming from a COD fan.) While it is linear, there is a greater degree of choice involved here in how to attack it. The AI is very, very good. They're not shooting gallery pop-ups hiding behind a single piece of cover. They move to flank, stalk, investigate, retreat etc. Hide in a room to catch your breath for too long, and one of them will run up, throw a grenade inside, and retreat for cover again to flush you out.  Cons: It ate ♥♥♥♥ and crashed to desktop until I installed the latest AMD/Catalyst update. I have a high-end gaming-specific computer, and it still stutters frequently on the sound - particularly during in-game cut scenes. While not nearly as linear as COD, it is far from being as open-approach as Dishonored (which it seems to be getting frequent comparisons to for some odd reason.) No multiplayer of any kind - this would have been a badass co-op game.   In summary, if you're on the fence at all: BUY IT. As long as your system can support it, it's worth every penny to the devoted shooter fan.",1
"Its uhm, good? i think, i can review it and ive never played it, 10/10- IGN",1

"This game is about a very intellectual man whom travels through time and space to the galaxy known as M15-M1, he then dedicates his time to finding a way back to his original time and galaxy. This game will have you clinching your ♥♥♥-cheaks and pinching your nipples with excitement, while at the same time tears of sweet joy/sorrow will roll down your cheak. It's a classic, one which has (if I do say so myself) changed the way video games were meant to be played! Prove you love jesus and buy this game!

"Poor performance, Multiplayer noob friendly, maps too big for the standards of COD. I really don't like this game. If you want ♥♥♥♥ off, buy this game.",-1
"Mirror's Edge is a really cool free-running game with some bad combat thrown in. Most of the time I just avoid combat entirely because it takes away from the flow of the game. Ignoring the combat, this game is awesome. Once you get a handle on the controls, Mirror's Edge can give you quite a rush when you're running and jumping through the colorful levels. The art style of this game is amazing in my opinion, with lots of neon colors contrasting with bright white. It can be a bit disorienting because it's first person and you're rolling around a lot, but you get used to it. I think this game is a 'must play' for anyone who wants to play something different from most other games.",1
"Awesome game, buy it, for the ones who like medival warfare",1
"A Short, Great and Amazing Game! And Such a Shocking twist at the end! I typed in my Username though.",1
"  Istrolid is probably the best free indie game on steam. Great idea, good realization. In this game you can play with basic, solid and working ships or spend a few hours inventing something new. Like i WW2: most of the soldiers were using rifles, grenades, tanks... and then someone invented the atomic bomb. You can even set set your own AI algorithms to make your ships think for you.  I'm waiting for more content like new parts, maps, gamemodes and maybe something like posibility of building an extremely big spaceship.

"Not enough eyeball spoon scooping. Definitely lacking in the eyeball spoon scooping. But you know, whatever",1

Its a very fun game. the rules for it are simple.  1. Learn how to use comander spicals  2. keep head down 3. move quickly  4. if you have a grenade throw it in the trench your attacking  5. LMG get set and   be careful with ammo   6. if your in a sniper team  work as a team to help the sniper spot   7. when in a gas team always lead the charge with a gas drop then a charge with masks on  8. make every bullet count to either keep a others down or dead. 9.flamethrower  is not to lead a charge to the trench  but first to enter  10. hide in any hole you can untill you reach the trench,1

"I absolutely cannot reccomend this game enough. It is HIGHLY addictive, and is a nice social commentary on video game development, as well as a decently accurate representation of it. It is so satisfying when the game you were confident in gets a great score, and so painful when it falls flat. This game can kick you when your down and reward you when you're up, making sure you learn from every mistake. My only issue with it is I wish it would more specifically tell me what I have done wrong. Many a time have I made what seemed to be the perfect game, only to have it get mediocre scores and have the formulated report only tell me what I did right and not how to fix what I did wrong. 9/10 MUST BUY",1
Grand Theft Auto V is a dead game but still fun as ♥♥♥♥.,1
what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you get this game,1
i love this game it's so awesome and cool you are awesome if you buy this game so buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"I recommend this game without hesitation. It's incredibly polished, fun, silly and deep. It takes the best parts of several games (Diablo, Don't Starve, Terraria, Pokemon, Monster Hunter) and mashes them into something completely unique. On top of that, the ability to play on the PC and then carry on in the same place on my iPad (and vice versa) is fantastic. It's also a bargain at its price - I've had more fun with it than most recent AAA titles. I've spent most of my time with the iPad version, but the Steam version plays exactly the same. I look forward to seeing what they add to the title in the future.",1
this game is full of russian and german bias,-1
OK!,1
Never ending fun. Such games like these you can play repeatedly. This game should certainly decorate your library!,1
"Got it for $15...and overrun (like a plague) of hacking, like don't-even-hide-it-aimbot-see-through-walls-50-1-k/d-hacking. VAC's a complete joke. NOT KIDDING, RIDICULOUS. Your left thinking someone is on the big pole rake off the huge amount of it. Kill replays: pre-firing, magic pre-aimed corner pops, 180 flip aiming, oh, and, not kidding, bunny hopping with mid air perfect snapping. Like these kids don't give a bleeeep.   And, and, not exaggerating, there is only TDM games going, and a little 'psh' of domination. Again, not exaggerating, like ZERO players in ANY other playlist. Like, zero zero. Not some, total complete zero...Which obviously to any real gamer (who owns a console and a PC) means you're in a 'git gud' kinda deal. Any gamer worth a lick knows TDM is for bottom feeding rocket jumpers, quake run-n-gun nonense gamers (who play more boardgames than video games).   Ask any gamer to try out a new multiplayer shooter, and first question you'll get is: 'Sounds cool, what are the game modes?' ...If you reply 'mainly TDM,' you'll a chuckle and a nice pat on the pack. #PCGAMINGRIP",-1
"It has a very good story line, and it has feels to it. Also it runs great, no lag and it just awesome!!",1
Well at least it helped me in renewable energy class,1
"A classic, remade.   Graphics - about what you'd expect for a remake of a 2D Disney game. I'd have liked an 8-bit mode, but what're ya gonna do.  Music - I dare someone to listen to the Moon theme and tell me it isn't gold. Both the original 8-bit theme and a modern remix of the tracks are in the game and you can choose between them at the menu - no DLC required.  Gameplay - Standard platformer meets pogo stick - bounce around on guys like it's 1989. Cutscenes are skippable and you can turn them off via a menu option but it doesn't stick.   Difficulty - Youse guys are pansies. There's an easy mode for you if you don't want to be penalized for jumping down a pit like a buffoon. If you're just clearing out your backlog then go ahead. But if you want to actually get better at platforming play on Hard or Extreme. They're frustrating but it actually feels rewarding to beat a level as opposed to a pointless waste of time.",1
i thought this game was amazing and it filled me with undying hope. p.s hope is the name of my husbands ♥♥♥♥♥,1
New experience but it belongs in a museum rather than in my PC,-1
Very fun to play with friends,1
Fun until you die with your best rogue by lava :( WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,1
Outlast is a   horror   type of game. I like horror games and this is my favorite horror game of all time. So you are man who wanted to investigate one asylum but got stuck there. Now you try to get the hell out of there. You have a camcorder with you and you can turn on nightvision. But it requires batteries. To investigate the darkness you need to find batteries.    Pros,1
"Awesome twin-stick shooters. Levels are fun, simple and very fluid. Local multiplayer is also very fun.",1
very addictive. great game play. love that it can be modded.,1
"Fistful of Frags is a F2P Old Western Shooter, and anything western is different in my book, and this game is totally free, no microtransactions or hats. I've been playing the game for a couple of days nows, I didn't play the mod since I hardly knew about the mod. However I can solidly say download this game, you won't regret it and will find ours of enjoyment and frustration as you get sniped with a Sharps.",1
what a great story...and fun gameplay! jsut wish...it felt more...finished...,1
"A very nice Visual Novel, except that I tought the main character has a brain cancer at first xD, But a Nice 3-4 hour gameplay (ofc if you're not doing all of the endings).",1
Game is just as good as Payday 2 :D,1
10/10 best game ever. Should be 60 dollers not 15.... Better then battlefeind. Better graphics then cod and better love story then twilght.,1
mmmm this some good ♥♥♥♥ hmmm this some good stuff right here boy,1
"Dirty Bomb  Dirty Bomb is a fast paced FPS completly free to play, although you can choose to spend real money on it plus the movements are smooth and nice the gameplay is awesome and i've never had such a high kd 3.33 so yeah it's the best  game  FPS in the ♥♥♥♥ing univers",1
my future my life!!,1
UH... WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! Don't play if you can't leave loose ends.... :'(,1
"It has potential, that's for sure.  My main complaints is:  -The amazingly stupid sector management AI which can't even put slaves and robots in the correct tiles. They keep putting them to farm energy credits and research points while ignoring the fact that slaves and robots (except synthetics) have disadvantages to farm it. -Non-existent diplomacy. It's so simple it hurts. Declare war, trade resources, declare rivalry, insult them. Just that. As for the casus belli for war, currently the choices are very limited. Giving only 3 choices; cede planet, vassalize, or liberate some of their planets.  The only part I definitely love playing is the early-game stage, you'd be surprised at what events the game will throw at you when you start to explore the galaxy.   The mid-game? It's your average Europa Universalis IV, but imagine it without any DLC. Yeah, that's it. Here's what you do during mid-game: -Build ships. -Wait for your tech research to complete. -Upgrade your ships with the latest weapons you acquired from research. -Declare war.  Rinse and repeat, since there's no other thing except warring other states to 'win' this game.  Late-game stage is bugged. Foreign invaders? Sure thing, the AI doesn't even fight them! Except for Fallen Empires, that is. I still remember when the Unbidden appears, it only gave opinion bonus to all AI states, making them forming federation here and there. But because of that federation, they won't declare war to each other since they're locking each other. That creates a horribly static galaxy which nothing happens, even when Unbidden starts swallowing those states, they don't do anything!  Then again, it's not like I hate this game or something, but currently it feels like an incomplete game. Perhaps in a year or so, when PDS releases some DLCs for this it'll be as good as CK2 or EU4, or even Vicky 2.",-1
This game is awesome ,1
"Never got bored of this game with a close friend of mine, Would recommend to anyone :)",1
This game the best thing that i ever seen in my whole life. F boobs size out 10,1
"A rather vast impovement over the original, not only does it run better thanks to not using Flash but it also boasts more content, i recommend getting it if you liked the original",1
"I have this on cd rom somewhere (I think my cat ate it) and put hundreds of hours into it. We have come a long way with RollerCoaster Tycoon. It's more improved then the first one, but coming off of the 3rd one I feel lost in this one. The graphics are sooooo bad compared to the 3rd one, it's really hard to get into it again after the 3rd. Ah well, it's still a great game and the owners of this will put tons of hours into like I have. I just had to buy it on steam because my disc ran away and I wanted to revisit the parks. (Tip - Play the first 2 games before you go and get the 3rd or else you will never want to come back to the old ones.)",1
"Well, its better than fifa i can say so fun and addicting. Gj developers!!",1
♥♥♥♥♥,1
"It's not officially supported on Linux, but I bought on steam and it does work on Linux (despite the fact it is not properly labeled) Come on guys, just label it as working on Linux, it's not so hard. It's (appearently) not even running under wine.",1
This game is worth the buy and your time. This game desperately needs a sequel NOW,1
"Guess I am on the lucky side of getting the game to work, after 9 hours of gameplay I am enjoying the game.  I can see how it can be repetative for some, however for me, its exactly what I expected from the gameplay vids and dev interviews.  If this helps: I started the game and basically sat on my first planet for awhile, built up a lot of units (money) and was able to upgrade the carrying capacity of my armor to 19 slots.. Once I got that I rarely ever ran out of space.   Also completing the first planet (finding all the animals) netted me a good 250k units just for doing that.  I then proceeded to continue the story a few steps, founda distress signal in space, and blew up some pirates.  After I decided my ship needed some weapon/shield upgrades, so I landed on a planet, and not long I found a crashed ship with the mods installed already and 17 slots. So I repaired it, and changed my ship, went back out and blew up some more pirates (was easier this time).  All the while upgrading and repairing i was able to find artifacts, bases, languages, resources ect. just naturally while I played.   Again, that is how I approached the game, and it was enjoyable to me and I will continue to enjoy it (for now at least).  The story is getting intreguing, not compelling, but did not expect that, I am not that far into the story however, so can't fully comment on that yet.  all-in-all I am enjoying the game, albiet i can see how it can get repetative, I just approach it with making a different task for myself as I go along.",1
"I recommend this game. But its more on my side that im OK with all the weakness of this game. One mayor thing, that im not a fan of: U duck to be able to sneak, but there alot of places u cant stealth kill due to that u cant stand up, it happen sometimes close to a wall and a box, or just random object. That really pulls this game down. But the story is quite good...  i would say its not worth 20 euro...",1
So... It's this Prequel or Sequel to the movie? Or not related at all?,1
The more polished version of Empire and it shows!,1
I've bought this game in the first week of december 2015 (running El Capitan already) and from day 1 it keeps on crashing everytime I play it.  Can I get my money back pls?  And why is it still being sold on the iMac platform with these massive problems on the latest iMac OS (10.11.2)???,-1
"This game surprised me. The first day I played it, I returned it due to being stressed. I was frustrated, the room was dirty, I couldn't move around, and was unable to enjoy it. After a day passed, and tons of regret, I decided that I would re-buy it and no matter what I'd keep the game this time, good or bad. After re-downloading and getting things going, I played basketball. As I began get warm from the continuous movement and attempts and bombarding the net, I realized this game would be perfect for me. I had been looking for something to get me physically active during the upcoming cold months, and Pierhead Games is definitely one I plan on using throughout. The basketball game was just the tip of the iceberg. Pierhead games has a one punch boxing games that gives you a nice good sweat, a light up button games that can also be a great exercise, and the other favorite basketball. I'd say these three alone are worth paying the price for. In addition to that, there's shooting, some penguin shuffleboard type game, claw machines, prizes, and a few others. The fact is Pierhead Games is a d**n good price for what it contains and showing this to a kid, a loved one, a family member will leave them smiling. Make sure to have the AC on, take breaks, and above all, enjoy.",1
"This is a great game to play with friends. Doing heists, being stealthy, and going loud is great with your friends! You get to coordinate, interact with the world, find packages, and do some other stuff. In all, this game is highly recommended to people. There are some cons though. The AI you are with don't even try to help you on this heist, I get it, coding their reactions to things in stealth mode is going to tricky but I'd actually prefer some support than them just standing there, waiting for my friend &amp; I to get the cash &amp; then get out. Next is the DLC which I keep seeing a lot of, personally, I like having everything in a game. So whenever I see DLC, I just feel I need to get that so I get the complete game experience.   There may be more that I missed and add to, but for now this is all. I recommend this game, unless you like having the complete game, don't want to by DLC, or you don't want to go solo.",1
"Like Portal it takes one simple gameplay mechanic then weaves (no pun intended) it into addictive little puzzles that fan out into a thoughtful, enchanting story in a beautifully rendered pixel-paradise. Yessir, it is good.",1
It's k.  [EDIT]  This game has emotionaly destroyed me. All other games are just disappointing now after playing this and im too emotionaly compromised to play this game. THANKS KOJIMA!,1
"This Dwarf Fortress-esque game was abandoned by the developer long before it reached anywhere near its potential, stay away.",-1
"worth buying, there were a couple jump scares that actually made me jump",1
Awesome Naruto Game!,1
"Pretty damn good game, especially if you put up some mods and tweak it a little bit. You get to have a nice variety of different adventures.",1
"Great realistic shooter, get some friends to buy it to have an even more fun time",1
One of the best RPGs out there,1
"  So i played this the first night i got it and was instantly hooked, the story is great and the graphics are the bomb. Beat it in 8 hours",1
"This is a case of Steam not policing itself. This game is not finished. It's extremely poorly optimized, misses a lot of features, and is buggy as Hell.  There's nothing fun here. It's just a lot of potential thrown away and Steam is stealing your money by allowing you to buy it.",-1
"waaaay better than 1...graphics and gameplay are better...larger world, more customization, more pets to choose from, cooler looking gear, plus there r mods in the workshop.",1
"Slash and burn, ride or die, 'this' is most certainly the game that will make Burn-Out look like a complete puppy in comparison, and the best thing of all - you can play more then just two at a time.",1

Very immersive and awesome. Also fultoned a sheep 10/10,1
"If you don't like having your time wasted by people who don't know how to tell a story effectively, I'd advise you not to buy this game. I'm not averse to cut-scenes on principle, but I would like them to have been designed to tell the story without wasting too much time watching people do nothing, or doing the same thing over and over again. I hear the later parts of the game are alright, but I did not want to waste my time getting there.  Edit: If the refund limit is 2 hours of playtime, you will have to skip the cutscenes to be able to actually get through the tutorial and try the game before reaching the cutoff time.",-1
"Not as good as oblivion, but far better than skyrim, atleast that's what i think. The thieves guild and dark brotherhood expansions are awesome, and its a first mmo im actually playing in 1st person rather than 3rd person. Overall id reommended atleast trying the game, when its on discount its worth the price.",1
This had a very good but sad story.. 10/10,1
"This is a brilliant game :D The option to customise your armour is awesome, the soundtrack is beautiful and the story is fantastic :D I strongly recommend this game :D",1
"It's fun when you first start out and learn about the ships, but quickly loses its charm when you run into the high-level man children who think they are God's gift to humanity. There is zero effort to actually punish or reign in these people. Also, the max number of players at peak times is only around 300 players, which makes it hard to find good games.   Overall, Guns of Icarus is slowly dying of terminal cancer. Save your money and go buy a pizza or something.",-1
"At first I wasn't sure I wanted to watch dogs. Last time I tried to watch dogs I got arrested for vigorously masterbating in public or something like that..... but I pre-ordered. Once I got into the game, it was easier to watch dogs then ever! In sleeping dogs, it was boaring to watch them because they were sleeping....but in watch dogs, they are wide awake! And I can watch them all I want because when the cops try and arrest me for public masterbation, I simply turn out the power on the block I am in, run around the corner, wait, and then run back and watch some more! SO EASY! And I can use my completly next gen graphics that wernt handicapped to feel like I am in real life and not not have anything to do after the story is finished!   11/10",1
you just randomly mash some buttons and your protagonist pulls of some 'platinum games'-style moves... and it doesn't even feel wrong or off somehow,1
7/10 the gameplay is fun and addictive. the community is not toxic or atleast has almost no toxic people in it. you can set up games with your friends with out a problem. you don't have to keep paying to play if you want to play it for free you can play on their site. BUT i don't like the steam way of leaving the game cus you have to close the game to join a new one if the first game isn't finished yet. the invite friends to lobby option is a bit slow if someone just got out of a game of their own.  but i like the gameplay and if they fix these minor issues will make the game great ,1
"10/10   now that the game came out,better i take out the eyepatch or i gonna to stay blind  and not forgetting, a Hideo kojima game.",1
"I have been addicted to this game for days.  Picture FTL, but instead of spaceships you get an Ironclad mech, instead of space it's 1886 England, the French are trying to conquer Britain, and you are a British Ironclad Pilot/Commander. The battle system is easy to use, but difficult to master. An important thing I learned for instance was that you really have to consider the match-3 game as just an opportunity to get the upper hand (a buff if you will) and that the true tactics are how you will use the resources you already have this turn, not the ones you may get in the 3-match.  The different types of missions that you get to pick from add a level of fantastic customization to each game. Do I risk a hard mission for a potentially big payout or do I do a medium difficulty one? Do I do a salvage mission (Try to defeat your enemy without destroying one specific component of theirs) or do I go for a battle or a collection mission?  My favorite component to this game is that every single game I have played has been AMAZINGLY different and unique. Every play-through so far has been new and exciting...and I friggn' love that!  If you like FTL I promise you will enjoy this game. Go check out some game-play footage on YouTube and you'll see what I mean. You're welcome.",1
"A simple Seated VR 'experience', this is actually a pretty good way to (comparitively) bechmark your VR rig.",1
"I pre-ordered this game, like many of you did, when it was first availible on steam. A friend and I waited the 3 months for it to be released, did the pre-instal, and on the launch date we both promptly started a skype call and clicked play. My game started up no problem, however he has had a countless number of issues and ever able to get passed the rockstar launch screen. I was able to play for the past few days but then, just about an hour ago it refused to open. I have no fix for this and there is no reason for it not to open. So no, i do not suggest buying this game until literally all of the updates and glitch fixes have been released.",-1
Bad..they took away bhop,-1
Holy **** this game is amazing,1
"This game is really cool and fun, even though it has no storyline.  Just don't cheat, cause then it gets f*cking hard after a while.",1
"Defintely a fun game with some familiar and some new mechanics. The level of advancement and discovery is a lot of fun in the first 30-60 minutes, but after that it starts to taper off until it has slowed to a crawl. The later game feels too much like a grind. I found myself starting new games over and over, but actually finishing a level just doesn't feel like a lot of fun.  For now, it's nice in the bargain bin. If the devs fix the later game, it could be a real winner.",1
"I like try&amp;die but this.  Art and sound are great tho. You are as gracefull as a potatoe threw into the air while every other ennemy is two times faster than you. I may have liked this game if I played it before Rogue leguacy/Castle crashers/Smash licence  Beeing handicaped naturrally against foes without capacity to overcome it exept huge HP pool isn't fair difficulty. Loosing all of your items on a run for the sake of respawn isn't fair difficulty. Having to rely on RNG to get a decent weapon for decent damage output and success a run isn't fair difficulty.  The whole art direction makes me to keep playing, the unfair challenge too, but the gameplay really threw me off. Maybe in coop.  TL;DR : If you liked playing Dark souls in heavy armor you'll love this game.",-1
"I love this game! you can fight the combine, make a hover car, and so much more! this is the reason i got steam!",1
Tis good,1
"As a huge Bioshock fan, i just had to get that game, and so far, i am not dissapointed. since Bioshock is the spirtual successor of System Shock, they are obviously sharing same features, and they are both feeling the same in some ways. bioshock players will feel at home (although the outdated graphic is kinda annoying, but hey, we are not judgin games by the graphics, its all about the gameplay!) and the story, like the Bioshock series, is deep and thrilling. the controls are kinda.. clunky, but you'll get use to them sooner or later. all in all, its a great, hard game, and i highly recommend it! (i bought it for $0.99, seriously, a bottle of coke is more expensive... just get that game already)",1
it's like what Diablo III could have been if the devs knew what they were doing :bloodymary:  10/10 game tho,1
"I change some settings on the video options and my screen gets all glitchy and when I press escape, the menu doesn't show up and even if i delete the game, reinstall, etc. I cant get it back to before.. I guess the game is good anyways BUT I can't play it so imma say no :/",-1

"The Good:   Story is compelling enough to keep you interested even if the characters are a little 2d personality wise. A threat system that will make MMO players a little more comfortable. The maps, oh the maps, visually pleasing, just challenging enough, but most of all they give you a real thrill to explore. In a lot of these games I can easly predict which way is the treasure and which way is the exit. With this game I found myself exploring maps. Two tumbs up here.  The Bad:  Short: I did unessisary grinding, exploration and all the side quests and still finished at under hours on my first playthrough. Almost 0 replay value: not even a + game option to let you play through again with all your stuff intact. If you want to play through again you gotta lose all you've don so far and start fresh. This is made worse by the shortness of the game itself. Crafting: Normally a plus in this game it's a minus because it is pointless. 9 times out of 10 you are better off selling off the crafting materials and buying the gear that you need in the next town since it is the same stuff you would have crafted anyway and the money you get will go further than if you had made the gear instead of buying it. Side Quests: I found around 3 of them and I feel confident that I explored enough to say that is close to if not all there are. If your going to have side quests have a bunch otherwise just skip them. Much like crafting it felt like they added them out of a sense of duty than out of a real desire to have them be part of the game.  The Ugly:  The limited number of side quests and crafting options combined with the shortness of the story makes me think DLC. I hope I'm wrong but the game feels more like a framework that they are planning to add a ton of DLC to flesh out rather than just give us the whole thing from the start.  In short good game for under 10 bucks but full price isn't worth it.",-1
"Played for six months. After finishing, sat through the credits just to reacclimate myself back into real life.   Yeah, immersive is a galactic understatement.",1
hate the skirmish game. AI cheats. Feels like a step back to the first C&amp;C games.,-1
"A shockingly in-depth and engrossing game. Warband asks you to make your own path, and pick yourself up by your bootstraps. It's a lot to take in, but once you get over that and the visuals, you'll find a massive and intricate feudalism simulator. Perfect for fans of sprawling and complex RPGs.",1
Great Game I like RTS in WW2 theme.,1
Uninstall works just fine. 11/10 ,1
"This game isn't bad but it's not good either. The idea of mixing third person combat and RTS is interesting but it's execution is flawed.   Remeniscent of Mass Effect when it comes to exploring the main headquaters and interacting with some of the main characters. The narrative is very linear and full of cliches.   A similar sentiment I can share with are the characters. None of them stand out as relatable or even worth detailing. The fedoras had more character than the actual characters.  The gameplay at best is abysmal, the fusion of TPS and RTS do not mix at all. The games design isn't justifiable enough to have the word XCOM in it's name.   Also the games AI isn't.  Example: I ordered my engineer to approach some cover just outside an enemy position (the enemy took cover in a book store hiding behind shelves and the main counter). So in close quaters he would have a clear shot with his shotgun. That was what should have happened.  Instead he took cover in the store, in the middle of the enemy position, he was surrounded on all sides and within seconds he was killed.   It was tragic but hillarious. I could've saved him due to the bleed out mecahnic but I decided not to for the greater good.   A more appropriate title/name for this game would be The Bureau: Darwin Awards Declassified.  I only recommend this game because of the shenanigans the AI is capable of enacting. But I would certainly recommend that you move straight onto Enemy Unknown.",1
"Game runs great on my modern pc. (6700k, 980m, ssd's 24gb ram).  I went into the game really just wanting an extended version of the last stage of spore. I don't enjoy pvp, just exploring and getting better stuff, finding new things.   I really enjoy the game and think it's fun. Like starmade or space engineers but far more vast and less focused around building the ships themselves.  I'm at the stage where I want to buy a new ship and I'm trying to find all the species on a planet and in doing so lost my own ship. Also it's an ice planet and I keep freezing.",1

"I haven't played this game on PC yet, but I beat it for xbox not too long ago, and I would say it's excellent. It has a great story, fun combat, and plenty of content. So far, I've been dissapointed in the Steam release due to poor optimization, but that doesn't change how well this game holds up, even 7 years later. 9/10  EDIT: Though I still love this game and would reccomend it, I must say that the PC port sucks. Like a lot. The keyboard and mouse controls are abysmal and they make it extremely difficult to set it up with a gamepad, especially on a mac. Great game. Lazy port. Steam version: 1/10",-1

Then I find it's mainly a storybook, and once in a while you get dropped into an active screen dominated by quick-time events. I despise quick time, and it boggles my mind that anyone would combine ti with a storybook format. Take mediocre to *poor* writing, then couple it with tedious, reaction-based gameplay? The Steam description did not prepare me for this - it looks like your typical world-based RPG with some pictures of the interface screens, but heck, most of the game *is* the interface screens.

Your actions develop different endings.    9/10  For unique stealth / puzzle game. Only reason why it isn't a  10/10  is because the guards  (enemies)  were a little dumb at times.",1
"it's just kinda stupid and overrated. the controls suck, the characters are bland, and it is hard to learn because of all the pro players smoking you instantly ",-1
"A complete sleeper hit, this turned into one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time, with the best bang for buck I may have ever purchased. 9/10, a must play",1
Too fun to miss!,1
Dramatically Journey... Mostly it's very good and sad story. One of the best atmospheric puzzle game! ,1
Nowhere near as fun as classic double dragon or streets of rage play those and not this whatever it is boring bland with silly over the top voice acting.,-1
Civilization 5 was better.,-1
"Good game but be weary of trying to play this ala full screen, especially in Windows 7, you have to mess with an inf file I believe, and even then it's tricky.",1
"This game is funny, cute, and gives you a smile. For me I really enjoyed getting all the endings.  BTW: Foxgirl was my fav 10/10",1
If you enjoy the matrix series this is a must have game!,1
"It maybe hard to get into at first, but this game one of the best ww2 RTS around!",1
"Sooooooo....After buying and beating this game (Huge Mistake) I can honestly say this might be the worst game I've ever played. Now without criticizing the graphics the music is trash. I mean dubstep can be okay but this is like some kid recorded the tracks on his computer and thought it sounded good. The level design looks like you threw a bunch of blocks into a blender and dumped out a design for a level. I think the main problem was not the difficulty, but how the game throws groups of enemies at you with out any warning. The hardest level in the game is 'Test 6' , the boss glitches out and starts throwing balls at you from everywhere, sometimes even above you, and you cant aim above your character so you just get pelted with balls. Level 9 was actually three levels in one which was actually fair and made more sense because it felt like you actually had checkpoints and made progress. I'm really not trying to rant about the artificial difficulty but thats what it is, Its not hard, it's just unfair. Another problem is the random slow-mo trat occurs after killing set enemies in the levels. It's so annoying when you're fighting a group of enemies and then the games slows down and blairs dubstep in my ears. Maybe if you could lower the games music volume, but they didn't give an option to lower the music in the game unless you go to your sound mixer on your desktop. These petty problems alone annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Every game should have sound options but when there isnt it is so anooying and off throwing that I really just get fed up with the game right away. Without talking about how bad everything is I actually had fun on the Ice level ('Test 5' I think it was) it was so fun honestly. It felt like something new and it looked alright. The level was pretty easy, which was dissapointing because that was the only level I enjoyed. Maybe if you copied the idea for that level and made more similar to that, you could have some quality levels or something. When it comes down to it though, this game just isn't worth it. Even when I spent $0.14 on the game, it wasn't worth it. I beat the game I promise you that for $0.99 (Not on sale) you could buy 3 better games than this. Please for the love of everything that is good, DO NOT BUY THIS ATROCIOUS ABORTION OF A GAME!!!",-1
Payday2 is an ok game its fun to play but the only problem is too many dlcs for only 1 gun and a few masks.,1
"For Path of Exile i got to say that you will only have your fun at it when you like that style of it. When you once played Sacred, you will know its not a big difference between it. Just a more worse graphic. I mean you lvl your char while questing through a open world(here better to say that maps are existing,which are different from their difficulty). Running with your char as fast as you can, while thinking about which way to go, can be annoying :D Anyway it`s free to play so try it out and its just at the beginning ,so stay tuned and wait for news .",1
"Running With Rifles is pretty cool I guess.  To put it simply, it's a top down shooter with more Battlefield Moments™ than any Battlefield game in recent memory.  Play as the green guys: They're like America and stuff. Play as the brown guys: They're Russia, sorta. Play as the gray guys: They're closely related to modern day... Germany? I'm not good at guns, please forgive me.  A good campaign will take you at least a few hours, and you might even lose. It's not some onesided murderfest where Joe McCool slides in on his military quad and blows everyone up, this is war. Watch in horror as enemy and friend alike get slaughtered before your very eyes with nothing you can do to stop it. It reminds me of Red Orchestra 2, which is a bad thing. Have you ever gotten PTSD that reminded you of that other time you got PTSD? I should also probably mention the level up system. They have one. Most of the ultra powerful commander abilities are locked away for a little bit to prevent that new commander I had in Battlefield 2 from ruining the entire game.  I give Running With Rifles 9 review points out of 10. Please don't actually run with a rifle, you'll put your eye out. Trust me.   Follow the Curator! ",1
This brilliant thing made me cry!,1
"Very fun, but realistic. My only complaints are the lighting and the fact that barbed wire is over powered. Not for the run and gun players of COD, but an easy death game. Not for the impatient.",1
"I've been playing Total War games since the first installment of Medieval, and Warhammer since the late 90's - so I could not stop myself from buying this game - especially due to the limited time offer to get the Chaos Warriors DLC for free.  I've invested about 30 hours in the game, and that was enough to feel there's nothing more to discover or enjoy. The game, while being very good - both in performance (no crashes, no bugs - thus far) and game play - is extremely shallow. More so than any other big title game I've ever owned. The playable races are few, and we are unable to play as the minor factions - which means that after a handful of campaigns there's nothing left, at all, in single player value.  I don't wanna write another of those 'The evil corporations are charging us for an unfinished game, then selling us the rest at extortion rates.'-reviews, we have enough of those, and there's plenty of reason for it. However I will say this: At the current pricing you're not getting proper value, even if you would still be able to get Chaos for free.  The game, as it stands, delivers about 20-30 EUR worth of playabilty, so don't pay more than that.  And I urge you to be cautious when the obvious DLC's for the left out factions start hitting the markets - they will most likely be overpriced and underwhelming as well.  Pick this game up at a sale, or not at all.  It's a pretty hilarious and well built game, but very half-completed and EXTREMELY overpriced.  As such I must recommend you to NOT buy it for more than 30 EUR, Chaos DLC included.",-1
Needs more exclamation marks!!!,1
Wow what a cuck game,1
"EDIT After 2.0 (expansion): K, I need help. I've spent more hours on this game than all the games ive ever played . By far my favorite.  The 2.0 Patch or the big expansion brings Act 4 with new areas with new mob types and so many changes im not even going to bother with it, I would say that the game is now at its finest (some may disagree) as its no longer required to spend 1000+ just to get the real funny stuff (again some may disagree). After the expansion I started on the new league, it was like a new game. Everything has been changed, I even messed up a few times (lol, 10k+ hours) and payed for my mistakes (rerolled 3x times). Since I hate writing stuff i'm gonna end the review thing now.  Just play it, if you want the real experience just play it to Cruel (Second difficulty). At that point you've met everything you can and it will only get harder after this, but you've tried most of the features.  EDIT After 1.3 patch: After 7k hours total, 800$ spent on it and countless of deaths in Hardcore and after picking up around 12k wisdom scrolls ( I did count, I promise). I still love this game, its my favorive alltime game after Diablo 2, a new league recently started in december sometime and ive been farming nonstop (Holiday started the same day woohoo) and now wield a Mjölner and wrecking Atziri!  With the new patch 1.3 which was focused on PvP there's now more to do, I myself have been doing Low level dueling and its tons of fun! Highly recommending it!  This game offers alot for nothing, there is everything from endgame mapping to low level dueling, both of which are fun! For every Diablo enthusiast out there you should try this, it does not cost money and it does not have ANY pay to win elements, only thing you actually can spend money on is cosmetics and more stash tabs, but none are needed to play the game!  A few flaws here and there, still some desync problems and a few other things that one does not notice unless you are looking for them.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: just about to hit 4k hours in the game, had to switch to standalone cliet since Steam one was abit bugged when Forsaken masters released! Still THE favorite game for me! and put around 200-300$ in it now, and will probably purchase the 500$ pack when i get the money!  Definetly my favorite ARPG since D2! Lots and lots of diversity and building builds have never been this fun:)!  At first looks it might just be a regular arpg clone, but its so much more! Only downside i can point out is that its ALOT too learn, like it took me atleast 100 hours to get down the basics, but im a slow learner anyways. Highly recommend to watch some tutorials or read alot so you get a basic understanding of the game!",1
One of the best games I have played in a while,1
"This game (with friends) is awesome. Pull of spectacular heists in spectacular ways, a definite improovement from the original in terms of gameplay.  The bad, the AI, completely useless (at least in payday they would shoot things, usually pretty effectively), it's like having lazy stormtroopers follow you around, they can't aim, they can't carry anything they can't open doors, start drills or crack safes, they just shoot....poorly.  UPDATE: With the recent release of new content including a microtransaction supported content pack I can no longer in good faith recommend this game to anyone. Overkill promised they would never switch to microtransactions due to DLC release packs (which are currently at around $80 additional cost on top of the intial game cost) with their latest updates $3-5 for weapon skins (that may contain stat modifers) have completely demolished anything that the game may have had left.",-1
"In short: great game. The art is certainly a big draw to the game and was as expected really good (based on the screenshots and description provided and linking that messed up but serene style). I enjoyed playing through the game multiple times (three times to be precise). The length of the game is just right, not to long to overstay its welcome and not to short to feel it wasn't worth the price for my taste. The story was interesting and the ending was satisfying for me. I really have to find more game in this style. The only direct complaint I can think of might be that parts of the art are only available through the trading card (yes, I really like it and generally kind of miss it in other games).",1
"Aweful Game, 2 / 10  let me scratch on the many ways this game is aweful, first off the intro sequence is half of the game, being that this game minus side quests is a total of only 1 to 5 hours long in main story, im not impressed at all everyone only raves about this game because it has good reveiws and lots of side quests. but being a fan myself of the old fallout seris this game did not impress me. with its lack luster story line and side quests being a selling point did not sink it for me.  In a nut shell: -♥♥♥♥♥♥ story line -uninteresting characters -inconclusive ending -literally a chore simulator -weak variety of wepons most are the same or reskins (overall think about 100 to 200 wepons) -weak variety of armours there were only 2 armours in the entire game that were worth while -side quests ARNT A STORY LINE",-1
"I haven't played for a hour,but to be honest here's my pros and cons.  Pros: 1-Terrifying,gives the scare of being hunted by serial killers. 2-YOU CAN BE NAKED! 3-The art style 4-Guns to kill 5-The sewer monster thing  6-Secret stuff to do  Cons: 1-Achievements.They are a bit broke,it only gives you the achievement when you quit from the game.  Ladies and Gentleman,i give this game 10/10",1
"So... after some of the patches and changes here and there, my game is a lot more stable... I so far managed to complete the game and I'm on side missions now but still hooked!!... so..  Pros:  -Zombies, Zombies... MOAR ZOMBIES!!!! -Cool weapons and effects -Awesome graphics! -best gameplay ever!! -Parkour?... HELL YES!!! -Great missions and a VERY gripping story line! -You get shot of a total asshat and feel even more satisfied than when you defeat Handsome Jack in BL2!!  Cons:  -Not very well optimised on the AMD side of things -Has a horrible tendancy to crash on overclocked GPUs (do NOT overclock your card... the game WILL crash!!) -loading times are sometimes a bit long (faster than GTA V though!! haha!)  other than those 3 little niggles... I love this game!!... it's a bummer that I can't keep the overclock on my GPU active with the game running though because that +100 MHz makes a huge difference!!",1
"Two thumbs up to Rockodile for making a really good, relaxing puzzle game. It's definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played on Steam, I definitely recommend.",1
Interesting ,1
"This game is... uh. Yeah. If any part of you thinks this might be your sort of thing, buy it. It's impossible to describe, but it scratches a very particular itch.",1
"took me 6 minutes to beat it, i plan on eventually finshing it though",1
"Let me tell you about this game. It's not even about the game anymore. It's about how it starts:  You're a cool guy. You've never watched anime, except for like, Dragonball or whatever. But that was cool, right? Then you get to high school and you think to yourself, man, all these ♥♥♥♥in weebs. what a bunch of total losers. You leave high school. Life goes to ♥♥♥♥ but you get netflix. You start watching anime on netflix because you've watched literally everything else on there. It dawns on you. You like it. You actually love anime. You feel the transformation. The hunger for superior Japanese content. Words you used to use as a joke, you now use in all seriousness. You start watching hentai. Even the weird tentacle stuff. You realise you've become the weaboo you always made fun of and joked about. You buy Go Go Nippon. The transformation is complete. You're a 22 year old neet with no ♥♥♥♥ing prospects except this game. Well ♥♥♥♥ing played.*  5/7 can't wait to play.   *at least 80% of this happened to me",1

16 hours of gameplay in 2 - 3 days .... yeah nice game,1
"MINIMUM: 500 mhz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection i dont even have a video card what blasphemy is this 11/10 everyone is better than me",1
this is the shortist game i have ever played dont buy it,-1
"Closure is a solid puzzle-platformer, hampered only slightly by its limited scope but aided by gorgeously stark visuals and moody score.   You play as a weird little spider thing that puts on masks of people's faces and traverses their memories (I assume, as there's no spoken dialogue). Platforms are only solid when a light source is illuminating them, and you manipulate a variety of these to create or remove terrain so you can reach the exit door in each stage. The mechanic is consistent, buta llittle finnicky -- terrain partially lit by orbs tends to create sloped edges or free-floating pixels of floor, which combined with slippery controls will kill you a few times. The most frustrating moments come from falling through a floor or wall after painstakingly setting up platforms in a 1-2 minute stage, because you weren't quite precise enough. But engine quirks come with the territory in indie platformers, so it's easily overlooked.  What makes Closure really work is the way the level chains are paced. It has over 100 levels, but cerebral puzzle-solving is broken up by stages that serve only to (literally) illuminate the backstory of the characters whose lives you're navigating. You only realize this as you're moving through it, and realize there's no puzzle beyond carrying the light to the exit and seeing the environment unfold ahead of you. It's a neat trick that made me want to keep playing in a way that an unbroken string of puzzles wouldn't have.  The game has some rough edges, but it's a very enjoyable playthrough if you like puzzle-platformers. Definitely recommend.",1
Nope big Nope for Infinite Warfare. MWR is good.,-1
"Wow, yes its very short, but its an excellent example of the power of VR. The fact that you cannot move is possibly a good thing so new comers to VR are not nauseated which is often off putting. The graphics are outstanding as is the audio that acompanies it. You genuinely feel that the T-Rex is there breathing on you!  I would very much like to see this expanded upon.  In short, if you own a DK2, do check this out as it acts as a great little intro to the VR experience, demonstating how perilous it can feel.",1
"Just a simple and interesting game!Dont know what to say its just perfect for platformer(For me ofc:D) If you can buy it,BUY IT!:D",1
"The first loading tip was for the in-game microtransaction shop.  ... Which is appropriate, because basically the entire game is a microtransaction shop.  It's bad. Avoid this.",-1
"Really fun, funny game. The combo weapons AND vehicles are absolutely hilarious and fun as hell to use. The missions are pretty funny aswell. You can build a ♥♥♥♥♥ rifle that shoots ♥♥♥♥♥'s at the zombies. Unfortunately, the game released with horrible fps and crashing issues left right and centre. And only a couple of days ago did the drivers get fixed. I played through the issues, but without them i've found it much more fun. I've played halfway through the game and already at 14 hours game time, so many blueprints and collectibles to find you'll definitely have fun playing if you like zombie games.",1
Pretty interesting although the whole game is a grind,1
one of my all time favorites,1
If you wanna ♥♥♥♥ your pants and play a sick FPS at the same time... This is your game.,1
Frozen Synapse may be best suited for hardcore strategy gamers. The controls seemed simple after the tutorial but the I found the actual game play and UI to be confusing. But maybe I'm just not good a turn-based strategy...,-1
"Good game, fun puzzles, and interesting story if you are willing to follow along. Would look forward to a room 3 with more challenging puzzles. Best puzzle game I played in a while.",1
"What can I say .. after over 900 hours of play time, I think the game is brilliant. At this point though I have to say I'd welcome the DLC that is supposed to be out with bigger and better monsters.  ",1
"All right, let's start with the annoying stuff (hoping that the devs will see it and patch it up):  - The save system sucks. It autosaves sometimes, but not often enough, so if you want to stop playing for the day, you will probably have to do all over again things you already did.  - There's no inventory. Sometimes, you pick things up, but you don't have the time to realize what it is.  - Also, I didn't find enough batteries for my flashlight, so I ended up setting the brightness on max.  Now, the positive stuff:  It's a really cool horror game that will probably mindf*ck you. Everything start when your friends disappear during a camp. You will try to find them during the whole game, but there's a killer on the loose and your paths cross. I wondered during the whole game if the guy you're playing was psychotic and was dissociating enough not to realize he was actually the killer. (It's not a spoil, just a theory I had.) The atmosphere is creepy and there will be some jumpscares but not that much, you won't see any scary monster, everything is suggested (which is so much better than actually seeing things in my opinion). There are some puzzles to solve that made me feel like tearing my hair out, but nothing too far-fetched.   In short, really nice psychological horror game. Creepy atmosphere. Nice graphisms. You should definitively try it :)",1
Great intense game and is even funner with friends. ,1
"This game.. Wow this game...  This game is the best warhammer game in the series with its superior modding commumnity and it still being updated after all this time.  This is the coolest game in the world, even if you dont know it yet",1
"My experience is heavily biased by having just finished years 1-4. It's not a *bad* game... it's just not as enjoyable as the first game. There's nothing specifically awful, it's just that every aspect of gameplay feels slower or has little niggles that make it more awkward and interrupt the flow of destruction.  I wanted to get all the collectables in the first game, this one just felt like a chore.",-1
Highly recommended to anyone.,1
A pretty neat game where you play as a rent-a-spy with nifty gadgets. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.  If you don't have it - go buy it now. It's a stellar experience.,1
"For all the fans of Heroes III, Age of Wonders and similar titles. Not recomended for casuals, they will cry loud..",1
"The greatest surivival/adventure game. Every game you do the same thing, fight many waves of enemies and level up, or just shoot as many enemies as possible, clear out the wave move on to the next area. Not since zelda or shenmue has there been an adventure game like this. Very addicting game, cool story.",1
"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a game for patient gamers. I finished every achievement, and had a lot of fun doing so. But it was not always fun. There were times when I raged like a gorilla. It is important not to give up in this game. So I recommend this to everyone who doesn't give up after 10 minutes of gameplay. First reason is because it takes a good while to get fimiliar with the game. There are lots of items, all of which do something else, and getting to know them takes a long long time. Ofcourse you could look them up on the internet, which I did at times, or you could just use the hints given by the game to figure out what every item does. Secondly, the game works in runs. You play the same maps every time, in the same order, except randomly generated with seeds. So even though it is always the same, it is never the same. If you think this will bore you quickly, then I would not buy this game.  The enemies are always strong, but you are not always. It depends on your randomly generated seed, what items will drop, and items are what makes you strong. So you need to pray to RNJesus that your seed will have strong items. If you do get them, however, you're gonna have a great time. Items being all different, is also the case with enemies and bosses. None are alike, they are all different in their patterns and attacks. It requires a fair amount of patience to get fimiliar with the game. But in the end it is worth it.  buy this game m9 u'll have a gr9 time i r9 9/9 dont h9",1
Honestly this is the first VN I've played until the end. And this game surely left me with a lot of emotions. It really gives you the insight of there are people of in this world who are suffering while being helpless. Awesome yet sad game!,1
"A spectacular piece of art.  Gets everything right.  Good, tight controls, plays well with the gamepad. Great music (it's on Bandcamp! yay). Gorgeous visuals. Fun combat that is simple-ish without feeling monotonous or too easy. Creative dialogues and a solid story that will actually get you interested. Tight platforming passages, but not too frustrating.  Getting the bundle that contained this game was a truly wise decision. Get this now, you will not regret throwing money at the developers.  That is all, let me dive into the game for another 8 hours now.",1
"*** Well people say this company is corrupted and money hungry, scamming people because of false promises... Well from my experience 1 out of 30-40 games turns out the way they say when they develop it... Now i play alot and i mean alot, i own mostly indie games and i have been following this game from its start but gave up waiting because of the larger price for an alpha. Now i bought it on a disscount and here is my opiniton:  The game reminds me alot of Command and Conquer Zero Hour, but here u dont just have a small map, u have planets. Building is streamed so you lose resourses as its built whych means if its destroyed in the process you dont lose 100% of the resourses needed but just the 40-50-60% depends on how far u constructed the building. Player vs Player is great, you can pick words from 1 planet to 4-5 planets from what i saw, and planets come in few types. Earth like planets have water for naval units and trees that need to be dissposed off before u can build, moon planets usually have more metal and they are pure space for building since no theres or rocks, lava planets have lava whych u cant walk on or build on and few rocks here and there, then there are snowy, rocky planets asteroids and gas planets that can onli be mined from the orbit. As a single player, you have galactic war and skirmish, skirmish is just a game where u pick an AI and just fight him while in galactic war u have to unlock load outs u start with, and on start u have basic ground tech avaliable. As u conquer and explore planets u unlock more and more tech, with the limit taht u can onli pick 3 tech from the start and expand on how manny u can have by finding tech slot upgrades. Now this is where the SP comes to have prbs because the tech u find is random, sometimes u find 10x same tech, sometimes u dont ever find a tech upgrade slot meaning u can pick 3 technologyes, then u start a fight with 4 planets and u have no way to reach your enemie because the basic units cant build fast enuff when they land before u get destroyed by their units. AI in galactic war has full tech unlocked and 95% of the time uses massiver AIR force over anything. Basicly there are 4 factions in galactic war and u pick 1 then fight the other 3. But they are not any different, they just have different colors, from tactics they just swarm aircraft then expand into other planets and then build nukes or crash a planet, they are rly predictable.   Overall its a RTS with massive battles, since units are built and destroyed fast, 2 resourses whych are energy and metal, ground, air, naval, and robot units, Orbital structures and different types of satelites, few ultimate weapons and alot of destruction and fun. Id recommend the game to everyone, especialy now on holyday sales where the game is on a 80% disscount and costs 3x less than its worth.   Go get it and enjoj! ***  Everything from the first *** to the next *** was wrote before i realized how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is... When u play matches or last fights in galactic war they usually take over 50-90 minutes, and you cant save the game... and then game usually keeps crashing everytime u go over the 50 to 90 mins of gameplay. This is a big ♥♥♥♥ you from the developers not fixing this bug because its been there since they made the shity game, dont buy this crap, ul just end up frustrated because u get into a fight then it just tells u ' close this apliacation' or in other words ' u enjojing it? well ♥♥♥♥ you im crashing'.",-1
the steam trailer is the ending cutscene 10/10 best spoiler ever,1
"Personally, I can't recommend this game because when I played it I felt like I was just playing a mobile game I bought off the google play store or something. The setting is cute, the art is cute, but besides that it's not very interesting. It's also somewhat punishing where I think when you die you have to restart the level and early on (or the entire game) there's no reliable method of healing. If you really want a game based around using spelling/words as a puzzle just go buy Words of Evil. It's over half the price of this game and better in every aspect.",-1
"Simply put, if you are looking for the most realistic, non-arcade, test your skills sim money can buy, this is your sim. The one thing I keep hearing from so many Steam user's, 'It's too expensive.' Look, I'm telling you now, this is more for the hobbyist who wants to go do the real thing but cannot afford it. Average local short track entry level car costs about five to six thousand dollars to build, and another 500 to a thousand dollars per year to maintain. In comparison, iRacing is way cheaper.  If you do decide to subscribe and run, remember a few things; The system in place is meant to be challenging. Everyone makes mistakes. Apologies are always welcome. Race smart, three wide in any car at Texas Motor Speedway in the quadoval is never a good idea. Don't be afraid to lift. I have seen far too many come in and try to race like this is Gran Turismo, or some other arcade racer. The whole point is to run competive, clean, and most importantly safe. Remember, everyone was a rookie once. Patience, perserverance, and lots of practice will get you running in the higher series. Oh, one more thing I almost forgot, there is always going to be an a-hole in the bunch. That one guy or gal that just never takes blame and no amount of apologies will suffice. Apologize, and then ignore them and do your thing.",1
"This DLC goes deep down the main storyline in GTA IV with a few bits and bobs in the way. Still a decent game to play with slighty improved graphics from GTA IV. I would only recommend to play this game if you have finished all GTA IV missions, otherwise it can be all a mess. I give this game a total of 9.6/10.",1
fun for 5 hours then a ♥♥♥♥ game,1
"i expected better from infinityward. the servers in this game are crap and i lag up/get disconnected all the time. and they didn't even put efort into making it. they just took a animation from MW2 and put new mobels and textures into it. also the guns lack detail to, the chain-saw's texture always has extended-mags, and a grenade launcher on it because they were to lazy to make seperate textures/mobels, i have got to say this was a worse decision than buying WarZ. it looks like COD is going down hill.... i hate my self for not listening for all those bad reviews.  just if we could get refunds since i spend $60 on this failure of a game",-1

really fun ,1
"I have spent way too much time playing this game since it released from beta. I paid the original 10$ for it when it released and I don't think there is a single 10$ I have every spent better. This game is filled with so much content and so much replay value there is no reason to just play it once. I have completly played through the game over 25 times and I continue to play though it, to this day. If for you are debating spending the money for this game, I can personally tell you, there is not a better value out there for 10$. If I had paid 60$ for this game I would still say it was a great value.",1
"Do you like shooting things? Do you like trying to beat your own highscore? Do you like overpowered combinations of abilities? Buy this game!  Shoot aliens, get powerups, shoot more aliens, get better powerups, keep shooting until you can't keep up. Simple but very fun.",1
"Why aren't you playing this game already it's fantastic, the animations are great and the characters well beyond cute. This game is well beyond worth playing and has a patch to remove censorship",1
first asking for email.... great! i just want to test it now but ok put in some infos about me.... Then error 113 please ask to support. 9 hours left for testing. I wasted my time in downloading this and its verry important for a game if you want to present the game that everything works. For me my interest is gone :P,-1
I shot some overprotective parents then made a guy barf rainbows (thanks to workshop) 10/10,1
wanna know why there's no more room in hell?     because my ♥♥♥♥♥ step mom was too fat.   10/10 game tho.,1
"Played about 50hrs now, absolutely LOVE this game. Frontier have done a stellar job; the visuals, the sounds (particularly a capital ship entering a system!!), the story, the expansive possibilities ...  My only bug is that, as a mac user, I am unable to use Horizons; but this is the fault of Apple, not Frontier.",1
This game is so fun and beautiful.,1
"Haven't fully explored the game yet, hold on for the review.",1
Devs have announced that they will ad a coop mode.   This game has: Great graphics Fun playstyle Fun online mode Workshop content Tons of Stuff to research/develop/customize  Had alot of fun playing it so far. Altough i must say its pretty hard and some things annoy you cause they waste your time. But nothing to extreme. Overall a great game i would give it 8/10,1
"Niiiiice, dirty, and cool, lot to do, and lot to see... Don't buy it for mp though... Recommend: Sure!",1
"Ugh. Lets all just say it. You are here so you can get the TF2 item.  Let's break down how terrible this game is.  There is a complete lack of good graphics, and frankly ugly. The controls are awkward and random, making the understanding of the controls awkward. There is a frame rate issue that I couldn't fix, not because my system can't play it, but because it is just poorly created and rendered.  The game doesn't go fullscreen, it has this halfway point which it sticks at. Oh, and headshots don't kill....? The tutorial was long and unclear, with poor audio. The game looks about an tenth as good as the trailer, it really is a waste of time. The main menu was confusing and poorly formatted, making it difficult to even find the tutorial missions.  The game itself crashed several times. For no reason whatsoever.  Overall I recommend this game to no one. This is the worst game I have ever played on Steam. Hands down.",-1
"Bought it during the steam sale, And with only about an hour into the game, i love it! Even at regular price it is worth it. Very fun and lots of things to do. Glad i got it :D",1
I think this is a very well made game and a good price for such a high quality game.Best horror game I`ve ever played!,1
"BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE GOOD: The game is fun and satisfying. The red 'x' you get everytime you get a kill feels like such an amazing reward. Even though its just one kill it just feels great for some reason, especially the headshots. Some may complain that the 1 shot headshot thing is stupid and although you may not be used to it, you will if you play long enough. Since every map has amazing micro destruction, you realise its a game who can be the cheekyest and find the best angle and murder hole. Every round and match is different and the addition to multiple operators makes you have to adapt to every new situation.  THE BAD: The game is hard to get into because of the dynamic destruction of walls and such therefore you may not be used to it yet. Especially when you get killed everytime at the beginning of the round. It can get annoying and the SLO-MO death cam is also very annoying. Netcode and connection at times can be flaky causing inconsistent feedback on killcams and gameplay itself. Although this game has a ranked, not many people seem to be playing it. Most games would be found in casual which seems to be the main staple. IDK why, ranked is so much fun but its either no one likes the ranked scene or the match making is screwed up. Speaking of which, getting paired up with diamonds and plats in ranked is a common sight. I was silver 4 being pitched against higher ranked people. Maybe it was because not enough people play? However at the same time the game was still enjoyable for i was still able to win those games.     OVERALL: 10/10 LOL even with all the bad stuff I said at the end, the game is still AMAZING in my opinion because of the varied gameplay and the fact that i play with randoms who most of the time communicate is an experience like no other. Ubisoft, yes, is a flaky when it comes to games now a days but they have been active in improving this game and I must say the the updates that are occuring are actually usefull and making a positive difference. We just need a more active Ranked community!",1
"MY GOD THIS FAME IS AMAZING! The creative gameplay, hilarious dialogue, and mind bending puzzles are what make this game one of a kind. The feeling you get when you figure out a puzzle in this game is one of the best things in the world. It's possible to beat the game in less than an hour but it being free makes it all better. Vince is so funny it hurts. P.S See if you can find the Portal reference in the game.",1
its a fine game could use more updates i got it for 0.37 if there are cooming some more updates it gotta be a fine game for the price,1
"Far and away the best Star Trek game ever. Can sometimes be a little repetitive at times but that rarely takes away from the fun. From the creative story mode to the awesome end game STF missions, there is a little something for all Trek fans. Well except J.J. Trek fans as this game's story is a continuation of the 'Prime' Star Trek universe, meaning the game takes place in same timeline as all the T.V. Shows and 10 of the movies. (The story takes place in 2409 about 30 years after Nemesis.)   Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are the playable factions and while on the surface they play similar; there are more than enough differences to make each faction unique and make you want to try each one at least once.  This game has microtransactions that include ships, uniforms, sevices, and extra characters but in all honesty; you can play the entire game and have a blast and never spend a penny. Also, it is possible through farming and grinding to purchase anything from the ingame store without spending real money. The entire game is available if you want to work for it and since the game is so much fun; it never really feels like work.  All in all if you are a fan of Star Trek you should give this game a try. It's F2P so there is nothing to lose but everything to gain. RPG and Science Fiction fans will also get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.",1
This is a great game and cheap. I highly recommend giving it a shot. Kept me entertained for a good couple of weeks.,1
This game makes me so ♥♥♥♥ing salty but i love it the amount of times ive mis-played/♥♥♥♥ed-up is aboslutely halarious but anyway 9/11,1
"You will probably never yell 'F***!' more at your screen more than playing this game.  But every time you die its your own damn fault. So you're really yelling 'F***!' at how stupid you are and how you suck at the game. There are few things in this world that can make you feel as good at being crappy as this. Every time you die your start over at the beginning and hype yourself back up like it's going to go differently this time. It doesnt, but it's nice to dream.  Remember you're doing it to yourself.",1
This game is awesome. I started on PS3. I feel swiching to PC was a huge and welcomed upgrade.,1
"Equal parts frustration and glorious triumph. 4/5, would frustrate again.",1
10/10 i already played the pirated version.,1
the best F2PFPS i have ever played!!!,1
great game 10/10,1
"Horrible game, do not buy this crap.  Servers are still not fixed, need to stay online for single player.   Pointless city acting as a giant menu, with loading screens in between and you can't run faster or fly.   Terrible DLC and fighting mechanics are nowhere near Budokais.",-1
"The beginning of Bioware's Epic darker fantasy franchise. If you have not played this game, you need to -- the characters, the worldbuilding, the romances -- everything about this game remains classic and awesome. Make sure to get all of the DLC though; the story of Shale is one that shouldn't be missed, and if you play Liliana's backstory first it may make your choices in the main campaign more challenging emotionally-- which is a good thing.  ",1
Seems like an ok game. Reminds me a little of Binding of Isaac. The game seems challenging and has alot of depth which is good. The multiplayer part is not very well done tho.,1
couldnt get the game to open up 0/10,-1
10/10 would lose all my friends again,1
Crappy controls  10/10,1
I have only played a little of this game but I can tell you one thing... ITS SWEET,1
"Great loot-driven game. Looks good and feels even better. You will never feel like you have enough, you will always be on the pursuit of the perfect set of gear, and just when you are this close to find it, you discover that theres is a better one to look for! 'New Game +' brings some nice options to the game after you beat it for the first time and if you don't feel like playing the same quests again (tough there will be some changes) you can always go for the maps mode where you will have tons fo different new maps to play through and look for that speciall gear.",1
"Quite fun, Imo needs some UI improvement. The driving experience is good, could be better.",1
:) very nice game,1
Another great roguelike. turn based. awesome random weapons its. like a futuristic Dungeons of Dredmor with more of focus on per level rpg like stats instead of the create-a-character ability choice from Dungeons of Dredmor. A worthy buy if you like the formula. Game is very hard!,1
"Amazing game! Have spent many hours playing Payday 2.  Sure, it has alot of DLCs and it sucks that you have to buy most of them but still, the core-game is enough.",1
GREAT GAME CANT STOP PLAYING IT,1
YES. MUST PLAY THIS GAME. VERY FUN.,1
"I bought the legacy bundle for 60 and now it's 15... perfect.  Great game I've played it for a long time and still do, but this game is very time consuming.",1
"Unforgiving and dirty, just like it's supposed to be.",1
"Not bad so far... I like the smooth movements. Amazing graphics, too. Though how long am I going to be fighting the same enemies over and over again?",1
"I recommend this game...but barely. I actually sort of got interested into trying it after playing through The New Order earlier this year, even though the games don't have a lot in common other than their engine...which most people don't care for. Anyways, figured I'd give one of id's only 'recent' games a try.   Rage doesn't know what it wants to be. I guess that's a common criticism so I'm not breaking new ground here. At a surface level, it looks reminiscent of Fallout 3, with a similar setting and even a rudimentary quest structure. However, this game is clearly an FPS and not an RPG. It also has vehicle traversal, even including racing and time trials. This wasn't what I was looking for going in, so outside of using the vehicles to go from objective to objective, it wasn't something I put a lot of time into. So I pretty much played this as a straight FPS, to the extent I could.   I was instantly soured at the layout of the game. You are fairly readily given the ability to explore the Wasteland, which while not a sprawling overworld that you can really get lost in, it does have some size to it and I was happy to be able to simply roam around, look for enemies, get off and find places my vehicle couldn't go. It at first seemed like I had a fair bit of agency to do what I wanted. I found a little nook with a few enemies, eventually I found a body with a piece of clothing marked 'Juno'. How interesting. I then found a one-way shortcut to a radio tower of sorts that I couldn't get to before. 'Oh, this is how to get here...' but I couldn't do anything.   Later I go into an encampment and I'm told that I need to find out what happened to Juno, and also that I need to press a button on the tower or whatever. That's Rage. It's not the best setup.  Rage is all about being told where to go, and after this first anecdote, I was never in a hurry to explore past where I was told to since having to revisit the area once under orders just seemed like no fun at all. So instantly, the game goes from initially coming across like a fairly open environment to one where you're shackled to where whatever the npcs want you to do. This isn't bad in itself, since many shooters are linear without much choice in direction, but it certainly makes beelining across the Wasteland on the the buggy following the objective dot to be far less engaging. To make matters worse, many of the game's sidequests, conveniently stashed onto a conspicuous notice board, just require you to revisit mission areas, and maybe traverse them backwards with a swapped enemy set. It's a little uninspired. There are a few sidequests that require you to converse with town npcs, but most come from the boards, which I've never really enjoyed that set up.  The game performs well, outside of the infamous texture pop issue of the engine. I thought I was prepared after having played TNO but it's significantly worse here. Luckily the pc gaming wiki was able to provide a near-fix, but those first few minutes of getting out of the Arc were certainly an eyesore.   The raw gameplay is solid, I love being about to hold all of the weapon types. The game starts out fairly modest with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, grenades, etc. After 5 hours though you're given multiple weapon types with multiple ammo configurations, and even quick use items ranging from emp grenades to boomerang blade and rc cars. There's lot of options, and I found myself willing to change up my loadout just to get a feel for everything. The quick menu configuration I thought was a little clumsy, with having to access the f1-f4 keys and having all of the various items just be mapped to a single button. Changing weapons and ammo, however, felt very natural. There were also a fair variety of enemy types the made different weapon usage quite the necessity (even on normal mode). Mutants that charge you straight on were better taken out with the shotgun and quickblades, while gearheads and more typical enemy soldiers would be better engaged with scoped weapons or grenades. Throw in the later game enemies with armor and shields and it was never really boring until...the end. The ending is supremely lame. I suppose look it up if you haven't played it.  The story is forgettable. You're just fetching stuff half the time.   All in all, the game is enjoyable once you get a texture pop fix and get over the rather lame quest structure and mini games and racing, And deliveries and sidequests. So yeah, a lot of fat that could have been trimmed. I think the game could have been a lot more polished if it had a focused goal. I suppose that's a bit tautological but I guess I see this game as being pretty exemplary of having unneeded side systems. I thought the crafting items were interesting enough, even if I mostly made the ammo and lock grinders and grenades and ignored the various boosts and bandages. The gambling games and various money sinks like trading cards, however, just seemed unneeded. Luckily that gave me more dispoable income to just try out various ammo types and build crafting items I normally wouldn't have tried. It also meant I didn't have to put a lot of effort into money-gathering events like deliveries and the monster tv segments. I just wanted to shoot stuff, you know?",1
Broken piece of SH*T!,-1
"So far I have only played through the orignal campaign, Deadman's Switch, and I have really enjoyed it. There are a couple things that were not quite perfect, but most of these are rough edges I have heard have been smoothed in Dragonfall which I am really looking forward to playing through.  Add in the ability to play user generated content and this is a must buy for anyone who likes Shadowrun or even just RPGs.  Highly recommended.",1
"It's very easy to become addicted to it. I played for five hours straight the first time (In that amount of time I went from a steadily growing little city of commerce to a starved and freezing ghost town inhabited by three 50yr old men, one 23yr old woman, and an 9yr old boy). Once you get the hang of it you can't stop. I can see this game becoming very boring, very quickly for some people and It will probably lose my interest soon enough as far as sim-like games goes. It's fairly repetitive without much sense of reward beyond your little people not being dead. I repeat myself however that it's still very addicting, If your ok with lying to yourself and saying 'I can stop whenever I feel like' this may be the game for you. I paid aprox $5 and It was worth every cent of that.",1
"Immersive, engaging and very addictive gameplay. With the steam shop as support the potential to build in this game is limitless.   Very fun, and the time will pass at an unbelievable rate.  Con - Game will consume your entire weekend. Needs better AI for problem solving. I.e. Sick citizeons is usually pulloted water, bad roads and low hospitals. Burning houses is usually badly educated citizens, bad roads, lack of fire service or poor policies.   I think with sharper textures in the building and roads, this game would be outstanding. Game size is only 1.7gb, but achieves so much.",1
As a Stanley Parable lover I can say this is a fine f2p to that game. It doesn't have as many endings or paths like Stanley's but it's just as funny and fun to play. I really do hope William Pugh's studio makes more games of this kind in the future.  Note: Pick up the recorder and cassettes along the way.,1

"Buggy, keeps crashing, by far not as good as the original game  Read the book instead.",-1
LOved it on console but to laggy on computer. Do you think?,1
"Much Better.  We are all familiar with the 2k series and 2k17 aimed to improve many of the aspects of the previous titles. NBA 2K17 is a huge improvement over the previous titles.  Lets start with the bad. Still some issues with movement and direction. The controlled character may get stuck at times with bad collision with other players. (i have to give 2kprops this was a huge problem in the last title, that is now a minor one). Unskippable cut scenes. The long standing issue of being penalized in team rank score, for playing help defense is a long standing issue that has been in many titles. The AI likes to pass you the ball when you run close to them which creates congestion. The AI needs to better determine when you are open. (its acceptable, not great.)  The good. The acting has bee vastly improved. It also seems like someone with a brain wrote the script (they appropriately avoid stereotypes and is appropriate no matter how you created your custom character.) SHOOTING NOW MAKES SENSE! Finally a shot percentage system that is more reliant on making plays and skill. The graphics, especially they realistic movements.  Honestly there are so many mechanics that have been vastly improved its not useful to go into them. What you need to know is that 2k is finally on the mend from 16 and 15. ",1
"Would not recommend this game. Without membership, it is very dry and boring, and still with the membership, it isn't worth it.",-1
"A very nice platformer. Not too hard in terms of difficulty, quite easy on the eyes.  The story made me feel like a child again. Recommend it for those of us who are tired of neverending war, both online and IRL.",1
"I have waited for a long time for them to clean up their mess, but ever since I supported the kickstarter way back and paid a good sum of money, I have NOT been able to play this game. Under vista 32 bit is 'normal' that the mouse cursor does not show. I can play in windowed mode... but I hate that. The game itself okay, but I never got into it, since it loves to crash.  Epic... sure... ... epic failure.",-1

"Good game. After getting the Legacy mod, it's a great game.",1
"Rogue Legacy is a rogue-like random dungeon generated game. Starting from this point has a nice movement a fight mechanics, despite being basic they are more than enough for its game-style.  The main point of this game is the replayability. You will probably take way too long to get bored of this game, even after finishing it many times. Why? It is challenging everytime you will play it. The traits on your descendants may give you a good or bad character depending on what you want to do in the castle, which will be different everytime you get killed.  There is actually nothing greater than seeing after 30 generations you get to defeat the first boss, and see how it gets even more freakin hard.  10/10 Would die again, and again, and see how my giant, dyslexic, color blind son enters onto the castle.",1
"A lot of people are saying the first one was better, but I simply disagree. This game is spot on, and an easy 4/5 for me.",1
Worth every single penny.,1
I liked the part when i could not start it. ,1
"Juuuuust barely, though.  For each awesome thing about it, there's an annoying flaw, as well.  For starters, a controller is an absolute must. The default keyboard controls are cumbersome at best, and cannot be changed, for some reason. I was able to use a PS3 controller by installing MotionInJoy and Better DS3, then setting up Better DS3 to treat it like an Xbox 360 controller for best compatibility. You can find a few online guides to help you out.  I loved how your mech movement feels heavy and clunky. I can see people having issues with this, but it makes me feel like I'm controlling a powerful, badass machine.   The action is terrific, with a nice variety of challenges to tear through, and only a handful of frustrating or slow moments.  Visually, it's pretty meh. Some of the spritework is nice, but you can certainly tell the game is made by an indie developer.  The music is great, with some awesome tunes to get you pumped for the next stage or boss.  It's not a long game, as a determined player could easily get through this in a couple hours. At least unlocking and trying new weapons will give you a reason to replay at least a few times.  The plot is harmless, stereotypical fluff. Unfortunately, the in-game cinematics can become tiresome, as they are unskippable and will have to be seen every time you continue.   In conclusion, if this game is on sale for cheap, and you're a hardcore fan of side-scrolling run-n-gun action, go buy it.  Otherwise, this game probably isn't for you.",1
This game is so fun.Ask you friends or family to play maultiplayers its really fun,1
"Initial impression? Awesome. Beautiful art style, engaging music and sound, excellent job of mixing strategy and action gameplay seamlessly together. Fun gameplay - requires thought and planning, not mindless button mashing. Music and sound does an excellent job of building tension.  One of my best game purchases in a while. Refreshing! Congrats to the developers!",1

Amazing story line and game play. I loved the year one aspect and that fact that Batman is overly brutal to make a name for himself. I recommend this game for any Batman fan.,1
"Its a great game and for a few bucks it equals a lot of hours and i quite enjoyed it because the devolpers always update it and add new and amazing content that can't be recreated. when i first heard it, i thought it would be like minecraft and i played minecraft before but the sheer content of it blows minecraft off its heels. With mods, it can be very fun and me and my brother can play it for a long time.",1
its a great challenging game to play,1
Most grabbing platformer i've played in a long... long time.,1

"Besides the horrible graphics (which is justified by the scale of the game and the amount of people online at one time) the system for combat and leveling is awful. Pay to win players are everywhere, and its like your guns can't kill them, but they one shot you. That isn't really the issue tho, since its level and experienced based i can almost let that pass. I however, cannot stand having to walk around for 30 minutes before i find someone and the instant action button puts me in an area with one other person. Area might as well be as big as skyrim, where the ♥♥♥♥ are people?   Anyway, waste o' time.",-1
"Disclaimer: A key was provided to us for review purposes but in no way does it impact our review.  Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers here from Universal Gaming Reviews to bring you our latest review summary for Epistory: Typing Chronicles by Fishing Cactus and Plug In Digital.  I'm going to say this right off the bat, this game is easily the best typing game that I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  Epistory is a narrative based tale that feels like Bastion crossed with a word game. It features some excellent narration that really adds to the overall experience. It also features an absolutely gorgeous paper art style, excelent voice work and very fun typing based gameplay.  It's an excellent tool for those looking to improve their typing skills but it also makes for a great game as well. I managed to beat the game in 5 hours myself so don't mind that I only have 6 hours play time as of writing this review. (I'm used to typing everyday so I breezed through the entire game without much of a probllem)  Definitey a game worthy of checking out though, even if you aren't a fan of word/typing games, the game is worth playing just for the narration, art style and gameplay.  Thanks for taking the time to read our summary and full review folks, happy gaming!  -Shaun Meyers out!  Our Gameplay Video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T8OGt210CQ ",1
"Nothing about SSZ will blow you away, and there are probably 10 better space flight simulations on the market, but this one does everything to the letter and doesn't worsen the experience. Worth playing.",1
"gameplay is fine but there is a slight delay on the controls and some of the indications for beginners are not so clear and easy noticeable, other than that its a cute game ^^",1
"Dead game. Barely anyone plays. I can spend up to 30 minutes in queue waiting for a match, and get only 3 out of 5 players for the 5 man matches anyway.  This is due to players of differnet levels being matched up with similar level players. So while you're level 1, you'll get matches quickly, but once you get to level 80+, the game becomes a ghost town.  All other apsects of a game is irrelevent if you cannot even play the game.

This game is like wine. It gets better over time.,1
"Highly recommend this game. No spoilers, just play it for yourself. One of the best ideas in gaming. 100/10",1
I honestly feel like writing a long review for this game isn't very necessary. This game is by far one of my favorite games I've every played. It never gets old and it just gets better when you have friends that play the game aswell. It's extremley cheap and beyond worth the money. BUY IT!,1
"The best narrations I've ever heard from a game, Great story and heaps of replayability.  A bit short, but that doesn't affect how great this game is!",1
Still just as great as when i first began playing it. Devs Still adding updates to it. Great game for people who are creative and adventerous!,1
"I was so hyped to play this VN. I've never played a Chinese VN before, so that alone was a new experience for me. But I think, like most other people who bought this game, I was most attracted to the idea of the game's sixty-one endings (that's including the ones the free DLC adds). After a couple of lucky coincidences, fate brought this game to my Steam library, and I am happy to be reviewing it today.  So what do I think about this game? Well, let's start at the beginning. I'm very much used to the typical style of visual novel where all you do is pick choices and watch the story unfold. But this is a game about passing a test! Of course you'll have to study for the stupid thing! So the developers added a Tokimeki Memorial-esque system where you can choose your activities for the day in-between other scripted events. These include studying, exercising, talking to friends, equipping items, and sleeping. I don't mind this system all that much, but the randomness adds a level of challenge that I feel at the time of this review may make certain endings almost unattainable without a great deal of luck. (For the record, I did not use the official guide during my first playthrough, although I think it may be necessary to reach some of the endings.)   But what's a dating sim without a story? Turns out the very first thing that happens is that you're tied to a girl named Muxin after 'accidentally' confessing to her. She happily accepts, but both her and the main character (whom I affectionately named Eisen) know that it will be difficult to maintain the relationship when GaoKao is closing in. Eisen unfortunately scored relatively low on the first mock test, and both Eisen and Muxin grew depressed. After breaking up, Eisen became a gaming addict, cutting himself off from the rest of humanity to find acceptance in another world. His friends and family desperately look for him, eventually finding him at a net cafe. Eisen receives the grave news that his mother is in the hospital, and he quickly breaks away from games to finish GaoKao. However, the damage has been done. Eisen not only lost his touch with the ladies, but he scored low on the GaoKao, just barely making it to a low-ranking university. Three months pass, and he finds out Muxin has scored love with someone else. There seems to be no happy ending for poor Eisen... ;_;  And you know what makes that worse? I would have done almost the exact same thing in his shoes. Out of all the variety of canned situations presented in most visual novels, this one has the nerve to read out my future in Chinese academia as Episode 7 of Charlotte. (Obligatory Key reference, check. ;) ) And that's not a bad thing. :P  While the ending I got at the time of this review hit me in the heartstrings, I think the journey there was just as enjoyable, especially concerning Muxin. She's an incredibly sweet character to be around, and seems tailor-made to be the ideal girlfriend. Most people come into this VN after already being dumped IRL at least once; I don't have such a medal of honor. What I can say is that it comes as crushing to see her move further and further apart from me, even after all I did. It's a learning experience, in more ways than one. Whenever I do find myself dating in real life, hopefully I can take something away from this game.  Anyway, on to the technical stuff. For a company that's only put out  one  VN so far, the art style looks very pretty. Every single character is well-drawn, the backgrounds are good, and the CGs are crisp and clear. The game utilizes the KiriKiri engine, a popular commercial engine used for such notable titles as Fate/Stay Night. Perhaps that has something to do with how professional-looking the game is. The UI is clean and user-friendly, the transitions between days and scenes are smooth, and it's capable of many different banner effects. After reading this and F/SN, I can see why people love using the engine so much.   In terms of sound quality, this is where the game starts to falter a bit. The music feels like the kind of music you would listen to while studying: slow, calm and inoffensive to the ears, but not catchy enough to be memorable. The music is by no means bad, but compared to higher-profile VNs (again, citing F/SN and its awesome soundtrack) it can't really work outside the context of the game. The voice acting isn't necessarily bad either; in fact, it fits the characters exceptionally well. I'm no expert on Chinese dialects or social etiquette, but the tone of delivery seems a little off in some situations. The characters seem like they're speaking in indoor voices throughout the entire game. This doesn't hurt the quality of the voice acting since there is a volume slider, but perhaps I'm a bit desensitized by the outlandish, hammy screaming Japanese VAs like to do. :P  Then there's the script... *takes a deep breath to calm nerves*  Although it's still readable, the translation is less than stellar. No offense to the translators, but the usage of English grammar or sentence structure comes off as a little awkward and imprecise. Granted, Chinese is a very difficult language to translate to English, because there are words and phrases that just don't translate well. But quite a few sentences in this game look like they were put into Google Translate and pasted on to the script to save time. I hate being critical, but the script is the most important part of a VN! When a native English reader has to stop reading to think about what the people are actually saying, something's wrong. I'm sure it's something that could be patched, but as it is, the awkwardly-translated dialogue bothers me the most out of anything in this VN.  Something else I noticed about the script...a few terms exclusive to the Japanese language are used in the English script, when the characters say nothing of the sort. It's not exactly a problem I have with the script, but it speaks something to me about how much passion and respect for Japanese culture (even though it's a VN about Chinese culture) went into this VN...  Beyond the smaller details, such as a clean, responsive backlog and autosave saving my life on a couple occasions, I don't have much else to say about this game. So, do I recommend this game? Yeah. Although the script is a somewhat garbled mess, it is still readable, and it offers a lot of insight into the social consequences surrounding the GaoKao exam, as well as an interesting, heartwarming subversion of the dating sim formula. It's worth checking out to see if your own future in Chinese academia will look bright without a walkthrough. :D",1
"Fights are short, brutal and chaotic. If you play as an Agathan (blue), you might find yourself accidentally killing your teammates because they're totally drenched in the enemy's blood, making them red, which is the other team's color. Impromptu duels happen which are tense and exciting. The combat system rewards timing and movement. I don't generally like being able to kill my teammates but in this game it's necessary because it forces you to think when you fight in a massive melee. I've never played the expansion pack, but I love the base game and I find myself getting sucked into it, then looking at the clock and realizing hours passed. I highly recommend this.",1
"This is by far the best VR game out at the moment and if they keep up teh good work for a long time coming. Definitley the best replayability and great for that multiplayer itch!

"Pretty decent, tbh it needs alot of work, great concept but a little bit repetetive",1
Strangely addictive.,1
"I wouldnt say this game is worth the 9.99 they have it selling for. Maybe more 4.99? I very much love these sim games which is why I was excited to play this but after the first hour it kind lost its touch. It was kinda challening the first few times but then it gets kinda repetative. Making sure they rest, making sure they have paint and taking orders. There are small events that can happen that make it a bit challening but other than that not much else. Honestly if I could get my money back for it I would.",-1

"The game doesn't even work. Games for windows live is broken, I've tried logging in 50 times now and nothing works. I can log into my account on the xbox webpage but it doesn't work in this f*cking game. F*ck you steame you pieces of sh*t.  REFUND!",-1
"Addictive,challenging,cute,achivements,replay vaule and artwork makes this game worth your time. At first it may sound easy,but later you find out game's true puporse: It gets harder and harder,but also more fun to take on. To free the birds,you must put them into a 3 of the same color so you can complete the level. At same time, each move you do, the eggs that hatch into the birds will spawn. This forces you to be more strategic and more thinkful about your actions. If you like challenging,thinkful and great puzzles,this one is for you.",1

"Wow, would you look at all the negative reviews. Does that scare you? It scared me.  I probably wouldn't have bought the game either, but I got it in a bundle with some other farm simulators. Despite my reluctance I decided to give it a test drive one day and see what all the hate was about.  Ten hours later I came to a conclusion and can now tell you what I think about this unusual game.   First of all, you have to be familiar with farming sims and understand how they are played. If you don't know how to operate the machinery then you are not going to have fun. That brings me to my second point: half of the reviews on here are from people who have absolutely no idea what to do and, instead of looking for help, they decided to nix the game altogether. The other half is from jokesters who jumped on the hate bandwagon because that is the popular thing to do nowdays.  If anyone with the least bit of interest in the subject would have taken the time to learn the game then I think they would have appreciated what the developers have almost succeeded in creating here. I say 'almost' because I can admit that it is not a perfect game. Yes, it does have lots of bugs; and yes, it is slightly underdeveloped. But no way is it the unplayable disaster that the reviewers here would have you believe. I have played games far far worse than this one.  It helps to have some prior experience with farming, but the game itself is quite easy to learn. I have a rudimentary knowlege of the subject and still didn't know what to do. I found the tutorial videos from the main menu but they would not play. However, with a little bit of digging you can find the videos in the game's main folder and watch them from there. You can even read the subtitle files that accompanied the videos with insightful tips. Reading and watching those made the game so much more easier to understand and I have been having fun playing it ever since.  My gameplay experience so far has ranged from average to great. It is a small game without a lot of replayability; so I can't see myself spending any more than 25 - 30 hours on it. But I am enjoying the game for what it is. It's a farm sim set in an historical period; and it's not trying to be anything more than that. The sooner you can accept that the less disappointed you will be.  Maybe I am a bit biased for having such a strong interest in antiquated farming. I've tried recreating the same time period on the more popular farming games without success. Their antique tractors were nice, but in the end all it is is modern farming using old machines. But this game is so much more detailed. You actually have to connect implements by hand and get off your tractor each time you want to lower the seeder for planting. And the plowing itself is the most real I've ever seen in a farm sim. Instead of having ready-made fields for you to plow, you have to decide where you want to grow and start digging up the green. I spent hours on my first day outlining a field in my backyard and plowing a sizable portion of the yard. After cultivating, fertilizing and planting I'm now waiting for my first crops to show.  This game also features the most animal interaction I've ever seen. You have to keep them stocked up on hay and grass. The bales can be stored in the barn loft and, just like any farmer, they must be thrown down to the bottom floor and placed in designated locations. Milk and eggs can also be collected and sold at the local market. Unfortunately the animals do not move much, but you can walk them to places you want them to be. You can also breed them for their offspring and sell your old animals. And make sure you don't scare the chickens too far away or they may die of starvation.   The machine models, I think, are some of the best-looking in a game like this. They all look beautiful and shiny and historically accurate. There are a few different tractors you can purchase, including a John Deere model; not sure how they were able to acquire that license. The implements are varied and also look good. Antique plows, cultivators, seeders, balers, wagons and more have been perfectly modeled. Even the harvester is one of the old ones that is pulled behind the tractor; something I haven't been able to find in any other game.  I plan to spend more time on this game because I am actually enjoying it. However I do wish they would patch it with fixes and added incentives. There is a gas station in the game, but you never run out of gas. Was this a planned but cancelled feature? Also you can sell logs, but no way to chop down trees? That's disappointing when you realize that the game could have been so much better with a little bit more work. But, still, it is not a terrible game.  So far I have experienced no game-breaking bugs. There was an incident in which all of my animals disappeared, but I reloaded an older save and they returned. Some times the game does lock up when launching, but closing and relaunching usually helps. There are some minor physics issues, but the solution to that is don't do stupid stuff. This is not an FPS. Treat it with a little bit of delicacy. Why would you be doing silly stunts when you should be farming? The only real annoying thing that occured was when one of my pigs and dog became stuck and I couldn't move them. I drove the tractor through them and they returned to normal. Sometimes it's the simplest solutions that save the day.  Even though I wish more work could have been done, I am still happy to have discovered this fascinating game. I would like others to enjoy it too, but I guess you can't please everyone.",1
Fun game Didnt play on steam too much only on glyph,1
the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,1
"Most squabble when it comes to its playstyle being similar to Batman: Arkham City, but I have to disagree. While there are mission points and the like that are a call to that type of open-end game, Shadow of Mordor seems to keep it alive. I've not progressed very far just yet, but I have to say that taking revenge on a captain that has killed you, is damnably fun. I think I've only completed four missions thus far and had the misfortune of encountering a higher ranking captain. A heavy strike from which was enough to send me to half-health. It's ridiculously fun for me and I encourage others to try it out. It also has a fun set of lore to find as well.",1
"I don't really know what Iwas expecting, but it was better than this. The only thing this game has going for it is the imagery and some of the story, overall it's boring and way way waaaaay too linear. The twist wasn't necessarily expected, but unoriginal. I expected something better, but this doesnt even come up to par with the original Bioshock.  This is the most disappointing game I have ever played.",-1
"Imagine yourself starting with barely anything: a low-grade cpu, low bandwidth, and little memory capacity. That's where you start in Uplink, but it's far from where you end. In this game, you start with barely anything, and work up to having a full-on gateway packed with incredible processing power, tons of memory and bandwidth, and even security systems for it! With this, you can break into banks electronically and steal millions of dollars. This game makes you feel like an actual hacker. You can access the international academic database, global criminal database, and the social security database, and you can CHANGE values in those databases for ANYONE, including yourself. Got a criminal record? Break into the GCD and clear it. Want to have a degree in something completely random? Access the academic database and give yourself that degree.  If you want Watch_Dogs because of the hacking, get this instead, it's cheaper and better.  I love this game, 10/10, worth more than $10.",1

"Not entirly sure what to say about Portal 2 that hasn't already been said in either Steam reviews or elsewhere. All I can do is add to those thoughts.  It's a fun game, and at times a little challenging. It's perhaps not as challenging as the original Portal was, and the increased story elements take away from the awe of a story actually unfolding before your eyes in what appeared to be a straightforward puzzle game. Yet, Portal 2 has a lot of humor and the characters are great. The story is fun to follow and only adds to the experience.   There are a few Easter Eggs in the game for Valve fans, which is a nice touch.   In short - sit back, play and enjoy.",1

"Definitely one of Telltale Games must haves. The game itself runs well and the mechanics are the same as with any other Texas Hold 'Em Poker game you would run in to, but what makes this game worthwhile is the characters you play against. Max, The Heavy, Strong Bad &amp; Tycho share hilarious, well-written banter between each other and the player, making it fun to stick around and play just to see what they will start babbling about next. Obviously a fair amount of banter is humour and in-jokes from their respective games/web-series, but is done in a way so it is still amusing to those who are not familiar with their respective Franchises. Another nice touch is the range of reactions the characters have to actions the player has. For example going All-In, depending on the situation, can cause the whole table to turn and look at you with suprise and shout. Alternitively the characters will also act smug if they have the upper hand, or get angry or frustrated if you are winning that hand. All in all, this is one of the most funny and interesting Poker Sims to play, and worth having for the occasional hand of Poker, with a table of characters who are very much, insane.",1

An excellent game that doesn't seem to go away. This game is still popular and has servers going all the time. Its a great game and the action is all over the place.

terrible at reviewing but love this game,1
"I played hundreds of hours on this game on a friends computer before I bought it, so this review comes from more time playing than my record states.  This is an amazing game. It is fun, thought provoking, challangeing and immensly satisfying.  The sense of wonder is great, and is beaten only by the sense of achievement each new accomplishment gives you. The feeling you get when you first reach orbit is pretty amazing. Then when you successfully land on the Mun that sense is so much the greater. Onwards to the rest of the solar system, each time learning something new.  One of the things I love most about this game is the way it teaches you about the real world. All the science lessons in the world do not compare to gaining a fudamental and practical grasp of orbital mechanics through the activity of your own space program.   The fact that you have cute little 'minion-like' green guys at the helm doesn't detract from immersion for me, in fact it somehow makes it feel a little more real. I feel a genuine affection towards Kerbalkind and feel proud to help them learn about their world and solar system.  Then you have the modding community. There are literally hundreds of mods to choose from, from an active modding community who're constantly updateing the mods in line with patches to the main game, and to add functionality. Everything from better bases buildable on other solar bodies, to Kerbal EVA engineering, to a complete revamp of the solar system (one mod actually makes a real scale model of our own system). There are even autopilot mods for those of you who prefer a more relaxed approach to the piloting of your craft. Although I would recommend revistiting manual piloting, because there is a lot to offer not using auto pilots.  I will probably play this game for many many years, and should there be any sequels I will play them to. I cannot think of another game I love quite as much as I do this one. I highly recommend this game.",1
"Simple yet interesting combat, hyper-compelling plot and characters, gorgeous art, and a lovely soundtrack. Highly recommended.",1
"Before venturing into this game, I will warn you, as have many others by now, that this game has absolutely nothing to offer in terms of lore, story, characters, or any narrative elements to speak of. This game is comprised solely of puzzles and explorations. That which it has, is done masterfully, but don't go in expecting it to be something it's not.   The central core of the game is about learning. EVERYTHING in the game, every maze, every obstacle, even the environment is a constant and concerted effort to teach the player. The problem, at the start of the game, is that the player does not yet understand the language in which the game operates. So it is the task of the player to, essentially, learn how to learn. How to listen and how to read, to be open to new and challenging concepts, and how to apply them to the world around you. This is the central experience of the game, and it is done beautifully well. If you allow the game to teach you, and you put your mind to work at it, this is a game that can be, and very much should be, completed without outside help or guides, because of how important your sense of discovery and understanding is to the experience of the game.   The landscapes of the island are gorgeous, and while the game does not have a soundtrack, the sounds of the natural world around you inspire a stronger atmosphere of introspection. The environments are varied and gorgeous, and the architecture is thoughtful and detailed. Every inch of the game screams with attention to detail, no space is wasted, nothing is without intent and purpose. Every aspect of the game works together to create a truly wondrous experience.   Perhaps my only complaint about the game is that one or two smaller sections of puzzles felt like they progressed with a somewhat unfair / disappointing form of difficulty, that just felt cheap and unimaginative. However this was a very small and specific set of puzzles, and is not a complaint I had anywhere else.   The 'main path' of the game is about 20 hours long, for a game like this, I feel like it's a good length: enough to keep you engaged and challenged, but not so long it wears itself thin. In addition to the 'main path' I've caught a lot of glimpses throughout my play of well-hidden additional content and hidden / optional puzzles, which, from other reviews I've read, could easily tack on another 20 hours for the particularly meticulous player.   Overall, The Witness is easily one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, and certainly one of the most unique gaming experiences out there. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys puzzles and thinking games.",1
better than I thought it would be.,1
This should come with tissue.,1
"This game is amazing. The story is amazing, along with the characters it brings to the table. If you like story, get this game. I've played a so much of this game and I still haven't seen it all. There is just so much to do in this game.   If you like tactical games, get this game as well. It may feel a bit clunky from time to time, but the planning aspect for this game is huge.  If you like beating up giant dragons, this is a game for you.",1
"Score: 7/10  This game will give you the feeling of playing a book/movie with a very thrilling experience, as it have a good and very mysterious plot that have been well spaced. The game seems to be developed to be played almost like a TV series, being divided in 6 different episodes (+2 if you buy the DLC's), each should take about 1h to 2h to be played without a rush. The light/darkness mechanic is the core point of this game and very interesting to play with, unfortunately I expected more variety and creative use of its possibilities, but the game fall short of that, giving you a dozen of weapons and creatures to play around instead. Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a good game with a unique way of getting you through it, but what you get after playing for 30min is pretty much all you will get till the end of it.",1
Very disapointed that the game does not have a real single player mode like all of the past Rainbow Six games. That was the only reason I purchased it. I am not big on multiplayer or skirmish games. I am in it for the stories.,-1

"Serious Sam 3: BFE is a brutal shooter set in Cairo, featuring Sam having to deal with a breakout of rampaging aliens.  PROS: + Quite long gameplay (easily 10 hours on just singleplayer) + Awesome unimaginably overlord weaponry, as well as a decent variety in weapons to use + Great dose of humor + Nice graphics + There is LOTS to shoot. Thousands of enemies per level if not + Elimination of annoying physics like recoil (that's right, there's no recoil or spread) + The multiplayer co-op is actively visited and servers are always availabe for both BFE campaign and the DLC campaign + Tons of secret areas and hidden items + Expandable with DLC + Bonus material available (OST, concept art, 'making of' videos, etc.) + Trading cards  CONS: - Gameplay is a lot the same, except for the changing locations and areas - The story is very generic and cliché, but that's due this game revolving around the shooting massacre and is done somewhat on purpose - For a game that has a lot of secrets that you often have to jump and climb to, the jumping in BFE is pretty terrible - Although it does have pretty good music, it has very little variety in it  A prequel to a classic and beloved series of FPS, set in a somewhat arcade style. A must for anyone who enjoys action and shooters in general.  My rating: 8.5/10",1
"My short time with the title, I would recommend...There are a tremendous amount of TL:DR reviews out there screaming that the game is not a faithful recreation of the games of old. Honestly, what new game is faithful to PC gaming prior to the porting of console games?  Take the game at what it is, a unique, stealth first person game. The story is interesting and the controls are pretty sound, for PC. I have not had any issues with controls to this point. The game sets a great murky mood although the voice acting could be better.  If you are on the fence, I would say lookup the game on youtube and turn the sound off. See for yourself without someone jabbering in the background.",1
"What is Borderlands 2 ? Well, it contains a myriad of multifarious factors that make Borderlands 2, one of my favourite games of all time. This AAA title contains many diversified missions and side missions that really tie into the game. The dialogue in this game is exceptional because of the many flourishing characters that can make anyone feel immersed into the game. The open world map, while not massive, is still abundant in its immersion and detail. The map, I feel, is perfect for the missions and the many different characters. The gameplay is marvelous because of the rpg elements it holds, as well as the progression and the not too vexing adversity that it cages. The vichysoisse of fun that this game holds really comes from the factors that I described and also the feeling of skyrim-esque immersion in the dialogue, characters, open-world-, rpg elements, items(weapons) and the paramount that makes this game good are the missions.  I recommend this game to anyone that owns and/or is interested in FPS's, RPG's, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Rage and the first Borderlands.",1

Pro: The animation is gorgeous; the soundtrack and voices are great; the fight system is intuative and varied; there is loads of content with more DLC on the way.  Cons: Locked to 30FPS; the resolution is lower than my native 1920x1080; the online matchmaking is dead, and even when it works it pairs you with someone of unequal skill; the video settings aren't customisable enough; there is aliasing everywhere.

The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.",1

"This game is definately a classic.  It is probably one of the best written games of it's era, and still is better than quite a few shooters released today.  The game has aged fairly well. It is clear that it is an older game, but if you can get past that, you will definately enjoy one of the best peices of gaming history available today.",1
Possibly my favorite game of all time. Not much more to say besides this being an excellent game for anyone interested in true tactical shooters.,1
The title should be: Emily is a ♥♥♥♥♥.,1
"I've played this game alot and it is a must play for anyone who likes high fantasy games. the UI is good and the story is awesome, graphics still hold up and the characters are well done.",1
"Definetaly the best game I've played in 2015, I cannot wait for Bad Rats Two: Revenge of the Cats; Rats defiance! I feel like it could easily win game of the year award.",1
"This game is a small interactive story that takes approximately 10-30 minutes depending on how many people are playing and how long they take per turn. I won't say what the story is, but I will tell you it can be very powerful. The 'Narrative' you make with other people you play with can shapes how the city looks at the end of the game, and how the characters you played as are affecteds after 'The Yawhhg' descends upon the city. There are also slightly smaller 'story-archs' that can occur during play that can effect what happens to other players before 'The Yawhg' actually appears, such as the baby and the bard in the gameplay demo. A small problem with this game however is that it isn't playable online exsactly, it's only local co-op where a single controller is used and is handed from one player to the next, but I've seen people play this on Twitch so that their freinds can play with them and see what's happening in game. Overall it's a great game that has lots of re-playabiliy, because it's events are randomly genereated from a list of things that can happen depending on shere you spend your week, and would give anyone that has freinds that come over something to play for hours at a time.",1
I've been playing borderlands since the day the first one was released so goiving this one a thumbs down was hard. borderlands 2 only increased in likeability from the first one and then they made this one. it's worth it if it is on sale but you can tell when playing they did it for the money and half-♥♥♥♥♥ it. i hope when they release 3 they redeem themsleves for the (almost) complete let down this game was.,-1
"Great sound track, great game play, great story. Yes, it was shortish but it was just great. There are two endings, one which I have yet to beat but it was just an awesome game. 9.4/10. Will be one of my favorite games. 2nd to Skyrim",1
"A bit boring, lack of a run button makes it feel like you're playing as an invalid for most of the game. A few immersion-breaking moments such as the end of the refinery raid mission.   Despite its flaws, the game is a very creative and original adaptation of the Lovecraft bibliography. Rather than basing itself off 'The Call of Cthulhu' alone, it lends from multiple sources which include 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' and 'The Shadow Out of Time'.   Overall, it does a great job of capturing the Lovecraftian bestiary, though the glitchiness of the game's engine draws you out of it a little. With better funding, direction and perhaps a less convoluded plot (though convolution is typical of Lovecraftian works), I genuinely believe this game could have been up there with Silent Hill 2 in the annals of survival horror.",1

Destiny is for rich b@tchez. Play this if you are a pro.,1
Dota 2 will ruin your life and make you hate everyone.  I love this game.,1
"Forget the Negative reviews! I got this game on Sale for $7.50 and its great! I will say its far better than Dead Space 3. Its bloody fun. It has very tense moments. I am not saying I was scared the whole time playing it? because I wasn't but it does build up into some very tense moments. The plot/story is nice all though not too complicated. This is my favorite Horror game. I played all Dead Space games I played Resident Evil 4,5,6. But this is by far my favorite. The enemies look creepy. To be honest? its a very satisfying game to play. I would rate it a solid 8/10. Its Solid all around.",1
"Pros: +Extremely Fun +Huge Map +Fairly Active +Large Variety of Servers Cons: -Can quickly get boring -Fair amount of abusive players -Apart from the top few servers, not a lot of servers have players on them  Overall this Mod is worth downloading as it gives the stock game a much longer lifetime and is extremely fun to play with friends. Apart from a few downsides it is completely worth it.",1

"So this game only took me about and hour and a half to finish, but don't let that fool you. The reason it was so quick I think, was because I wanted to know what happened in this engrossing story they put in front of you. This game is super casual, there are no monsters, there is no danger or level ups but you will still want to play. It's like you are playing through a short film. I don't want to ruin any plot points, you should discover them on your own just as I did.   I'm sure there are things that I missed and I plan on going back in soon, exploring some more about the side stories that aren't revealed and read to you when you find something. Other things are much more subtle, and you had to put the pieces together on your own. I want to find the rest of that, I want to know everything about this family now.   If you are looking for something casual to do for the afternoon, pick this up. It's well worth what you will pay for it, and I fully support this developer and hope they do some more like this.",1
"A very promising game, but unfortunately I think the gameplay is spoiled by all the random elements and some twisted unlogical mecanims that make you feel that you don't control at all what's happening in the game... it should be called 'How-long-am-I-going-to-be-lucky-before-bankrupt tycoon'..",-1
Well polished and solid game. Great 4x space game with decent graphics and sound. Coop with friends is possible and has dedicated servers.,1
"Awesome game, great with friends! Constant updates and the community was great when I played. (haven't played for a while) Highly recommend for someone who is looking for a new game to play.  Sports, cars, collisions, its got it all.",1
I lick a protester then my tongue stuck in an another protester.. the whole screen start to spin and when it's over I find I got bugged under the box where no way to escape. Never lick a protester. 10/10  most of the dlc's are worth getting only 1-2 which is ok but not my taste,1
"Easily one of the most entertaining games to play with friends. Win or lose, each game creates new laughs. Great factors were put into the game, and it feels as real as ever. I already recomended it to 10 friends. Great work Sid Meier!",1
"Another great addition to the splinter cell series. (I personally started way back with the original ' Tom Clancy's: Splinter cell ') Even without Sam's original voice actor, this new one does a very good job in his place. Oh, and the uplay? Doesn't really bug me, just another background program to y'know, just sit there and do nothing while you play your game besides allow you to play it (   and taking up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ memory   ) Either way, it's a great game. I don't get 'great' FPS while playing it, around 35-40, 50 in good places, but Spies versus mercs (What I play mainly) gets great fps, 80+ at times. Overall wonderful game, thanks ubisoft. Oh, and my USB xbox 360 controller works just fine with it. Yay.    Oh, ho. You thought I forgot the negatives? Ahaha, no. So, let's begin, shall we?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pings are very present in SVM, especially when you're in mid-stab animation with someone and JUUUUST as you shove your knife into their neck, suddenly, you're dead.  Uplay is just another stupid version of steam. A ripoff, if you will. I DON'T NEED TWO STEAMS, UPLAY. Spies versus mercs is infuriating to play, even as a new player (I am not a new player, for I maxed out everything on the console version- Which isin't as hard as you think it may be.) Stun crossbow is such an annoying weapon, espcially to have it used against you with someone who has basically the best aim in the world, you're guranteed to die about 10 times through the match. Oh, and speaking of matches, are you ready for this? There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ leave button during the matches. Okay sure, I get the idea of having to play out the whole match, but...REALLY? Suppose you have to, I don't know, tend to something else on your computer and quit the match? Tough ♥♥♥♥, you either force quit the game via task manager or you keep playing. Oh, and SvM is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Mercs ♥♥♥♥ing hug eachother and the only way to get them is to have every spray with machine guns into them.",1
"Great tactical shooter. not your typical run and gun, get killed and respawn type of game but a mix between a good amount of action you know from other tactical shooters and the level of realism of games like Americas Army.   I'd summarize it as a faster more fun version of americas army, with great graphics. Overall a great game for it's price.",1
"If you like FPS: GET THIS ONE, RIGHT NOW, HELL!.  If you love FPS games, this is the one. To me, this is a mix of the best things of Qake 4 and Doom. Scenarios are gorgeous. Characters and monsters are awesome.  Rest of things are under ID's aura: blood, hell, mosters, big weapons, big monsters, big bosses, pipes, machines, etc... At the very beginning, the sensation to be on Mars is just perfect: the sand, the wind, the light, everything together. Way far away of the sensations you can have with Doom BFG, by example.  Fights are frenetic, non-stop, constantly jump, shoot, dodge... total madness. You often go disoriented on the map. The character moves really fast, as the monsters do, you have to be in constant movement. This is funny but, the scenarios are that good that you would love to have a bit of time to enjoy the graphics.  Story is typical, on the line of ID' stories, not bad, not good but, perfectly suits this kind of game. Anyway, best shooter available, without any doubt.  I personally hate the boss fights, but that's me. It makes me to waste a lot of stupid time. I would love an option to bypass the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses (something I also hate in Namco's games). But that's me. If you like bosses, you certainly have some really challenging ones here.  On the bad side, lots of crashes, without any explanation (Windows 10 64bit), with the latest NVIDIA driver. And the checkpoits. We are in 2016. Can't we save the game at any time, any spot?. That's odd.  I would suggest them to give some more autonomy to the chainsaw, it goes out of fuel really quickly and, it's one of the most funny weapons. As well, there is no way to enhance such a weapon. That would be nice against the big monsters.  Playability is total. This is gaming. This is Fun, with capital letters. Re-playability is ensured. When you do your first campaing, you will probably miss lots of secrets and, parts of the map. You will probably love to play once more every map.  The end is open so, I bet they are working on a Doom 2. Which is a good thing, for sure!. Thank you, ID and Bethesda for bringing us such a cool game.  Still reading?. Buy it now, dude!",1
"4 Great Apes... pft no problem I have more than enough power to beat the likes of you. I'm not even affraid of your giant energy balls. I have so much ki and so much power I can knock them back effortlessly.  What's that you say? You'll just place them at the edge of the map so I can't counter them?  Pft like that would- wait... That does stop me... Because I can't attack it... and it wipes the entire team in one go.... oh well certainly it won't happen every time. If I confront the 4 of you enough surely I will win!!! Oh but you all have that move... and even if all of you won't place it halfway off map one of you will?  I see... I guess I trully am beaten.   I loved the oringial Xenoverse, I love this xenvoerse. If you have a console and some friends pick it up! However I can't recommend the PC version at this time. Expert missions have a handful of mechanics that due to glitches are genuinely unbeatable unless you are lucky and even though they have been working hard to fix the constant crashes (especially when playing in a group) it is still very much a problem. Once the game is stable and playable in it's entirety I will come back and change this, but for now I just can't recommend the PC version.",-1
"When you need to scratch your RPG itch, grab this game.  Best RPG I've played in a long time.",1
"I post reviews of free games I enjoy so I can go back to enjoy them in the future since they are not saved to your Steam library list, I'd really like to see Steam incorporate another section that lists free-to-play games you've installed in the past  A wonderfully crafted platformer, and any monster girl game is certainly a welcome addition to Steam in my opinion",1
You can become ifamous bank robber by burning all the ♥♥♥♥ing money you own and somehow forgetting every skill you've ever learned.  10/10 would do it again,1
Guns don't kill people. Bullets armed with guns kill people.,1
This game is amazing!!! I'd easily give it a 4.5/5 star review.,1
Very good game with solid combat(close quarters and long range gunfights) solid levels with different ways to get through them depending on your playing style. Boss fights are very quick and fairly difficult but you still keep coming back trying to beat that one guy. Then when you defeat the boss you then put another good hour into the game. All in all very good game definatly worth getting,1
This game sucks ♥♥♥. Like what the ♥♥♥♥. Why did i waste 200 MB and then 25secs of my life ♥♥♥♥ing downloading this ♥♥♥♥? And my ♥♥♥♥ing 29 cent. Like holy ♥♥♥♥ what the ♥♥♥♥.   Arret... [Stop in french]  I bet the french made this becuase this sucks ♥♥♥♥ and so do the frenchies,-1
"No Man's Sky is an amazing game. It's beautiful, fun, and time consuming.",1
It's boring.,1
"Don't play this as a game. Play it as a story. Take your time, and discover every detail in the plot and the environment. A truly moving experience...",1
"Okay so i paid £50 for this game and its sucks hard. The total war series is really aimed at the combat rather than its map, but they couldn't get the combat right ive played the first rome total war for lots of hours so i will be using that to compare i loved the first rome game as there was unit collision horses smashing into the back of unit on this game there is no collision when two groups collide they merge into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ where only one attacks. in rome total war the front line will get pushed back by the larger force or better tactics so the front line was always moving in this game they just stand there until one wins. The capture points is one of the worst parts of siege mode they spawn randomly which is good but if you rush to capture them and no matter what even if there 6000 enemy units nearby they will all retreat when you hold the point for a minute. Also two months after release there are still annoying day one bugs",-1
I recommend this game,1
"Super simple casual game where only one mouse button is used to play the game. You crash landed your spaceship on a remote planet. Now you must jump from planet to planet collecting screws. Gravity is the only gameplay gimmick, though it doesn't play the role that it could if gameplay was expanded to offer different levels of gravity. Instead you click when your character, on a rotating planet, is next to the next screw and they will jump directly onto the next planet. Of course this gets slightly more difficult when the path of the screws is further away, but honestly, there is no difficulty level in this game, it is purely a casual click fest. While the game doesn't offer much in a challenge, I still recommend it since it is well executed. Just make sure you get it for the right price.",1
Letting aside a few less inspired challenges this game is awesome !,1
"This game is beautifully done. From the atmosphere to the background sounds, everything is spot on. You literally feel every ounce of dread the character goes through with every step he takes; with not knowing what's going to happen next. The Alien FX is a nice touch too, even though the character rarely uses the candle, but I guess that's what makes it special. The black/white against the blood red is very effective and pleasing to the eye. The auto save feature is very nice as well, it's almost like they knew where you were going to die. From the creepy dolls following you, to the crazy hatchet murderer chasing you, this game is sure to keep you on your toes. For the best experience I would suggest turning the lights off, put your headphones on and let the Alien FX glow blood red.",1
"Found the graphics performance poor to the point that the game was unplayable. Used forums info to get tempotary fix, but game play performance would always degrade. Also had game crash and not able to recover using any saved game point, so lost whole campaign. Good premise and concept, but won't spend anymore time on it.",-1
"One of the few independently developed games I actually like. It's simple and easy to pickup and play. Good assortment of enemies, weapons, and equipment to play with. Not to mention it's available on Linux.  If it goes on sale, I'd grab it.",1
"The game seems descent so far in terms of atmosphere/gameplay. I can not stand the saving however. I really would like to play through it, however I detest not being able to save whenever needed. I'm a working adult with a tight schedule, I don't have time to replay sections because I didn't reach the stupid check point.",-1
"...PLS DO NOT WASTE MONEY FOR THIS... SWAT 4 IS BETTER, OKAY GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT GAMEPLAY IS THE WORST, OKAY ITS REALISTIC YOU DIE VERY EASILY,DO NOT BUY IT FOR 10$ IF U WANT TO JUST SEE THIS GAME BUY IT FOR 1$ ON SALE THIS GAME IS ....",-1
This is one the most stressful games I have ever played and is probably one of the worst as well,-1
its a good game. not the best graphics there is but its still good. i like the horror feeling to it and how its made. 8/10,1
Great game with great mods.,1
I really like this game..........but the stuttering is tremendous (GTX 970 G1). People with 980TI has the same issue.  And developers will never make a fix.  EDIT: Stutter has gone after format my PC.....,1
"WOW, this game is challenging as all hell, after beating it on easy, im done. this ckaame is recommended for any AVGN fan, and maybe the f*ckbillyb*lls hardcore muthatrucka, that plays too much. 100/100 for me, and remember, to beat it, yah gotta eat it :)",1
"Say whatever you want about Rockstar, they just keep delivering free content. This game is wonderful and everyone should own it.",1
"This is an impressive smartphone game.  On the PC however it's competing with the likes of Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, you name it. I could have spent more time with Ravensword, but that would take time away from exploring Morrowind's amazingly realized world, or touching up my hair &amp; makeup in Skyrim. All Ravensword seems to have is the terrible combat.  I couldn't stomach even 30 minutes of this game. The entire time all I could think is 'Why?' The same could be said about videogames in general. In response to that I say...well...I...hmm...oh....well ♥♥♥♥.",-1
"I like this game because it is so funny! It will make you laugh all the time! I also like the mysterous story line and cool art style! I love the variety of characters and weapons! The game was creative with the enemy 'Racalopes' (Half Racoon, Half Jackalope).",1
If you are a splinter cell fan then this is the game for you Pros : Good storyline good stealth elements Enemies eybrows go 2 inches higher when you grab them Cons: It keeps making my steam window small after i exit!,1
"This is a perfect example of an idea that was too big for the team that came up with it. It's a great idea: a game from the perspective of a blind girl, where most of the world is white and is revealed as she hears noises and explores. But the execution is extremely lacking. The game has a small handful of interesting mechanics, but even the best of them never live up to their potential. So much more could have been done with the idea of seeing what she's imagining, then discovering what it really is. More could have been done with the way she interacted with the world around her; how cool would it have been if instead of just revealing the environment in a perfect orb around her by merely walking around, you had to reach out and touch things, or actively use sound?  And even when you're being pleasantly surprised by what the game does right, you're bored to tears by its most basic goal: walking around and slowly, SLOWLY revealing things at a snail's pace. It's very obvious that the developers came up with the premise, planted a few small things to do then stretched the whole thing as far as they could. I mean seriously, you move at an absolute crawl with no option to move faster, 90% of your time AT LEAST is spent simply walking and trying to find your way through the story path, and still the game is something like two hours long.  Overall just a disappointing experience that I can't even recommend for the tidbits that I mildly enjoyed. The concept is a great one, but someone else with a bigger budget and/or more creativity needs to have a go at it.",-1
"'When I first got Trove, it was pretty good. Before Trion started to ♥♥♥♥ it over, they added so many microtransactions, that my FPS went from 60, to 15. There is so many microtransactions that my computer can barely run the game. All of the content packs in Trove, are equal to a morgage. This isn't a joke. I have already had to take out a second morgage on my house to afford Trove. So, all of that said, do not spend a single cent on Trove. Because it will compeltely ♥♥♥♥ your life up, let's be honest. This is worse than CS:GO cases...  Actually, nothing is worse than CS:GO cases. But in the end, I rate Trove 'A big ♥♥♥♥ you' out of ten.' -Chowderman/Michael Rosen: My friend.",-1

"Watch Dogs 2 has been very enjoyable the only problem I have had with it so far was/is with the multiplayer. Let me explain, It has only happened to me once but it still was annoying. I joined someone's game to try to hack them when I saw him through my drone I watched him get hit by a police car which blew up on top of him, then he was running around again when I started the download for his data he ran in the other direction as I went to hide. Within the next moments just after I had taken cover he materialized behind me before shooting me in the back. Again the game has been very fun other than that one time.",1
"♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Crashes every 2 minutes. Can't join games. Don't download, it's waste of time.",-1
Coming from someone who is a big Warhammer fan and new to the Total War series I found this majorly enjoyable. Usually I was just into 40K but this game inspired me to look into the Fantasy lore and I was not disapointed. I can see a couple of issues with this game and some people points in disliking but I love it and consider it a well done piece of fantasy warfare. I may not be very good but am always open to playing with others in campagins =D,1

"Don't let the sugary pinkness scare you away from this game: there's more virtual death in this game than you can shake a stick at. One wrong move and you might find yourself eating poisoned chocolates, dying by snake bite, assassinated by a family member, or murdered for political motivations. You'll find yourself wondering exactly what you could have done differently to survive. Should you become the shrewd, paranoid hermit princess? Or do you charm the whole world with your social graces?",1

Dont even bother with Train Simulator 2016. Its the same simulator from last year same UI and everything except the fact its now blue from grey. They just want more money from you dont even bother not worth the money.   Dovetail games i thought you would do better than this....,-1
"Ladies and gentleman, I have played this game for a few hours now, and i really like this game. The single player is challenging in the beggining, and it feels so rewarding seeing your warriors progress. Id give this game full recomendations, but the multiplayer is broken. I organised a Online only tournament with myself and 15 other people, but a third of the time, the game crashes in some way. when the game crashes, both players are punisahed, and can lose players and equipment for it. Even if one persons internet goes out, both warbands suffer. This issue needs to be fixed, because online League formats would make this game 10 times better than it already is. Please please fix these issues",1
"-The contextual icones are keyboard one when Gamepad is plugged -Widescreen is broken, textures are flickering -Loading times, outrageously longs sometimes -UI is awful  I dont want to get the game down, its a decent beat'em all for its time.  But this is obviously a lame and rough console port, if not a crappy emulation sold as a game.  Dont buy it until devs give up and make some patches to fix problems.",-1
"It's a pretty awful PC port complete with screen tearing, texture popin, dodgy aim and terrible online. Probably the worst thing id has created in a while.  It's also basically a tech demo for a crappy engine. (this version of the engine, at least).",-1

"  This game will make you sad that Gearbox wasted their time making Battleborn instead of Borderlands 3. Telltale Games shows us that the Borderlands universe is incredibly rich and that it is begging for increased feature depth and refinement. Maybe they'll have learned from making a bad Battleborn what is so special about the Borderlands experience, so that it will be even better as a result. Until then, this amazing game will keep you laughing as a hysterical love letter to a beloved game world.",1
Brilliant game. Improved on just about everything from the 2nd game. Totally recommend for anyone who is a fan of action games with a healthy dose of steam and open world gameplay.  ,1
This game should win cuz without Dota 2 my life is completely boring.,1
"I can't do a full review as it's not finished yet but so far it's been great. There's been less roaming around than in The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among us, the only other two Telltale games I've played, but the story has kept me captivated so far which is saying plenty for me not typically being a fan of most things DC. Some complaints about framerate and resolution are common about this game but I'm lucky enough to not have had that experience.   If you want a game that you can lean back and be lazy while playing but still be very involved, pick this up.",1

A fun experience going through the ages and changes of games with an actual storyline. Any gamer would enjoy at least one playthrough of the game,1
"Fun game with unique, challenging puzzles and a nice clean graphical style. Unfortunately the only achievement I couldn't get was a local co-op only achievement. :( Fun puzzle-platformer if you get it on the cheaps though.",1
"This game is a fun experience for all. Sure, the in-game purchases are expensive but if you lower the prices I WILL give it a 9.5/10 but right now it gets a 8/10.

See what the series was like before it became overly convoluted and lost it's heart and soul, now in HD!  I'm not going to go into detail but I love everything about this version of the game and would highly recommend it to pretty much anyone.",1

"I do it again and again. Bastion is poetic, metaphoric, beautiful. All the graphics are excellents, the artwork is incredible and the same goes for the soundtrack. Beside these elements, the gameplay in itself is addictive too: very nervous especially in the end of the game. I recommend it.",1
Best lego game i've ever had the chance to play. Reminds me a lot of the Spiderman 2 game which was incredible. Really fun going round the city and completing challenges and missions as a variety of superheroes. There's a lot of things to do once you've completed the story too.,1
Some people are playing the new Mad Max.  I'm here playing BORDERLANDS.,1
Best strategy game that I ever encountered.,1
A classic. Great fun with friends. ,1
Very fun game. Runs at 60 fps on ultra with GTX 980,1
the looked great at first 1080p and all that then i hit reset settings and now i can only set the graphics to 800...ow can i fix this? anyone?,1
this is good :D and fun if you want to forget something then try to play this game,1
"The Souls series is my favorite gaming franchise of all time. I adore the world that the developers have so carefully crafted and I've never been so captivated by gameplay. That being said, these games are definitely not for everyone. This review is dedicated to the people interested in investing their time into a long term experience.   I want to start this off by saying that I think that the first game is better. This game is still one of my favorites, but it's probably the worst in the franchise. Being the worst game in a spectacular trilogy doesn't at all mean it's a bad game because it is very far from that, but it does have a good few issues that I will share with you now.  NEGATIVES: I admire From Softwares for their attention to detail and the massive ammount of work they put into their games. But with that, once the game is finished they tend to get extremely lazy.  - The tutorials on how to play the game are displayed through notes left on the ground. These help beginners learn how to play the game. In the PC version however, the tutorial is given to you through Xbox controls, not PC controls. It's a minor issue but it's kind of disappointing that they couldn't change one little thing. - One huge issue with the game is another controls issue. This one is infinitely more troublesome than the first issue listed. The mouse is basically broken. Attacks are either delayed or don't even happen at all, making combat almost impossible. The solution to this is rather simple. Look up Dark Souls II PC control fix and install those. Just run the fix script while you play the game. It's extremely frustrating that the devs didn't learn anything from the Dark Souls 1 PC release and still managed to release this when this issue is so obvious. This is even the second edition of Dark Souls II and it still wasn't fixed when released or even patched in an update. Extremely disappointing. - Some of the mechanics make this game unessesarily frustrating, even for a souls game. Every time you die, you lose a small bit of your health bar that cannot be regained until you use a human effigy, which can be rather hard to come by. This can make a boss fight infintely harder, or just navigating new areas. If this is the first game you play in the series it may not seem like such a big issue, but playing the game in order can make this pretty taxing. Coming from Dark Souls 1, These newly challenging mechanics force you to change the way you play the game, which can be really difficult when you spend 100+ hours tackling the world one way just to get your ♥♥♥ kicked when you get to the next game. - Combat can be a little bit frustrating when it comes to enemy shielding. When an enemy has their shield up, you obviously can't do as much damage, but they have attacks that they have while their shields are up (just like you) but when they do these attacks, although their bodies are obviously exposed while swinging their weapons, they are still protected by the shield, so even though it looks like there's opening, there isn't. Wouldn't be as bad if the same applied to you, but that's not the case. You will be hurt even though they wouldn't.  I know these issues seem like they could turn someone off of the game, but honestly most issues are resolved in about an hour of playtime. The fixes aren't hard to find and once you get into the game the newer frustrating mechanics start to feel regular and you don't mind as much. (also there are in-game items that can help with the health bar) Now it's time to talk about what makes this game amazing.  POSITIVES: - The boss fights in this game are fantastic. In the first game, there was really only one way to fight every boss, which was to hug one of their sides and attack their back when it's exposed. The developers know, and they let you know that. The bosses are much more different in this game and you have to adapt to their fighting styles which makes it much more captivating and gives the world a feeling of realism. Of course the old strategy can still work for many of the bosses, but they can be a lot more unique. - Movement in this game is extremely fluid. Everything feels natural, and combat is very real (accept for the shield issue.) - Graphically, this game is still a spectacle. Frame rate is extremely smooth, and the lighting is stunning. Huge upgrade from the aesthetic of the first. The world has more of a 'flavor' in this game. - World building and lore is very interesting. If you really pay attention to the world you notice that everything has a story. - Extremely engrossing challenge. This game is very hard. Especially in the beginning. You may think that a game this frustrating would make you rage quit a lot, but that's not the case at all. 90% of mistakes are your own. (yes, there are a few times that this game can really cheat you and feel unfair rather than challenging but it's pretty rare.) Rather than feeling a need to stop playing, it just makes you want to keep going and get past that challenge to get to the next one. It's a near perfect mix of difficulty and fun, and although you will get angry playing this, when you take a step back you really see the beauty of the game. - Weapon variety is great. There are so many different play styles supported in this game. All of your medieval fantasies will be fullfilled in terms of armor and fighting. Armor is also great. They started running out of ideas obviously so there's some pretty ridiculous stuff around this world and it's awesome. - Leveling system feels like it actually has a purpose. It can even be like a puzzle. Each skill point matters and you have to make sure you distribute them well. If you do it correctly it can be extremely rewarding. It actually matters. It's more than a way to increase your health bar. (Do NOT only focus on health bar. I'd argue it's one of the least important stats.)  There are tons more things to say about this game. I'm just getting into it myself so I thought I would write this now in case you were interesting in joining in. It's an amazing experience all togethere and there are tons of positives (and maybe a few negatives) I'm definitely missing.  To put it simply, do you want a rewarding challenge? If so, you'll get your money's worth. You may experience a few trivial moments that make you question your existence, but hey, that's life. This game is awesome. (I would definitely recommend the first game though, offers a great explaination to a lot of questions you'll have.)  Grade 7.9/10  (I'll also add that I've played these games so much that every recommended tag on my steam marketplace is related to this game.)",1
"Good RPG, addicting, has quite a few mods. 8/8",1
I recommend it. IF IT WAS ON MAC &gt;:(,1
"A great game for zoning out, but could use more goals to work for.",1
If you love cars and racing than you'll love this game! It still has e few bugs but hopefully they will be worked out soon! 4/5,1
PLAYING THE ESCHATOS OST ALONG TO THIS GAME IS REALLY RAD,1
Being terrified as a baby and being helpless has never been so....terrifying!,1
the game is a must play.this is where art and storytelling merge with gaming. i wish i could erase my memory to keep playing this game again and again,1
This game turns me on :D ,1
Excellent story that fully immerses you. Simple game play with fun puzzles.,1
I got murdered by a flying castle and it stole my stars.  10/10 would get murdered by a flying castle again.,1
"Just seriously get this game. I'm not even gonna attempt to sound profesional in this review. When you play this you're almost certain for some mindless fun and awesome moments. The controls are pretty tight and gameplay is similar to that of several Max Paynes flying around the screen at the same time. I'm not even gonna bother, just get the game and see what I mean, it's free as well so go for it.",1
One of the crappiest games known to man.,-1
"Imagine if you will, a world of Lovecraftian horror. 10/10 Now imagine it looks like Minecraft. 9/14",1
"One of the better zombie survival games, doesn't just let you restart when someone dies and can prove to be difficult",1
"Although my favorite game of the series was Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ this one wins hands down as the best in the series for the simple fact that it actually saves your progress (seriously, why was this not thought of sooner). It also ups the challenge of having to rotate the pieces which I really liked. The worst thing about this game is the annoying fairy, but luckily you can remove her (just press delete). The other thing I didn't like very much was the crappy background music, I didn't think it was very calming for a puzzle game which I play to relax, but this is probably more of a matter of tastes than anything else.   Overall a nice game for people who love puzzles and anime!",1
"I really like this game, it kind of has the classes of TF2 but with a Battlefield and CSGO like combat and maps, but very fast paced and not so huge, also has intresting gamemodes and 'balenced' classes, none of the classes are balenced, but they are all OP in there own ways, medic moves incredibaly fast and can instantly revive someone just by pressing E over them and also has a shotgun with stupid damage close range. Overall this game is great, fast paced and crazy, but can also be really intense if youre try harding with friends or just playing a competitive.",1
"There are some boring and somewhat unnecessary conversation pieces that slow down gameplay between repetitive action scenes, and true there isn't much story or gameplay-wise here that is any way extraordinary. Yet I still recommend this game for it being able to deliver the satisfaction of grinding through a complete progress of events and for being fun where and when it matters.",1
i lile this software had to google to start what the layer do ect but after that i learnt it with in 2 or 3 days you can chose to do no scripting but i like to mess around with the code to see what it dose good for new game developer and samll developers that are looking to mke a game it also lets you encrypt your game so no one esle can edit your game (to edit it in the futer you will need a unencryted game files) it is also very very easy to make games with this all you have to do is click on what you want to do next you can inport music graphics ect and if i went on all about what i like about this it woudl be extreamly long   p.s would recommend buying during steam sales its £2.45 in the uk very cheap and £18.99 when not on sale  ~Deve_mahn,1
"The game overall is great, I wish we had more Final Fantasy games on Steam, but one major improvement that needs to happen is better optimization for your games. Port them better and give your players options and the money will follow. Think about the player experience first and as a result you as developers will be rewarded handsomely every time by the loyalty of your fans; provide us the service we expect from great developers like you. Looking forward to the future titles with the improvements listed below if you decide that this game doesn't deserve your attention!  SUPPORT CUSTOM RESOLUTIONS! 1080p support at a minimum! Some people have weird monitors with weird Aspect Ratios. This stuff is important! -This game needs to use multithreading (using more than a single CPU core), because that is the core issue behind the unstable framerate. That is the priority because even if they add 1080p without fixing this issue first, you will have 1080p with 30-60 frames skipping wherever they want anyway, like it is right now. Most people here at the bare minimum use a Quad-Core CPU, and thus would like to put it to full use, even Alan Wake which came out on PC a few years ago makes full use of all cores in multicore CPU's. The game is being bottlenecked by only utilizing a single core, so no matter how strong your graphic card may be, the game will struggle to run even on high-end machines.   FULL SET OF GRAPHICS OPTIONS! Allow users to change Antialiasing, Anisotropic Filtering, V-sync, Shadow Resolution etc. -Better optimization for the game so that it can run better for different graphic cards (AMD, Nvidia). Some people run it perfectly fine without any issues, and some people can't run it at all due to unplayable frame rates and other graphical issues.  LET USERS CHOOSE WHICH LANGUAGE THEY WANT TO DOWNLOAD! The Dual Audio support is a welcome feature, but you've nearly doubled the size of the download! 60GBs is no joke! I'd like to be able to right-click the game in my library, and have the option to uncheck Japanese Audio. Simple! Or have an optional DLC download for the people that want the extra option. For free of course.   REPLACE THE CURRENT CUTSCENES WITH PS3 QUALITY CUTSCENES!!! When FFXIII was released on XBOX360, the cut scenes were downgraded to fit the smaller disk size. Why have you done the same here!? It will take up even more HDD space to have better quality cut scenes and some people might not like that, so create an option of an HD High Resolution Texture Pack DLC, another free DLC; giving your customers options is a good thing.   ENABLE FORCE FEEDBACK FOR SUPPORTED GAMEPADS The Vibration/Rumble on controllers seem to add a little more suspense to the gameplay and cutscenes, as you already know I'm sure; since the console versions supported it, why not here?   Square, you need to fix these problems. I have some predictions about what's going to happen here. You're going to see articles on Kotaku, Polygon, GameSpot,‎ etc. about what a terrible port this is, and about how modder’s have to step in and fix a game for your customers again. I think you'd rather not have that? I'm not going to pretend that I know how easy or hard it is to fix these problems, but I doubt it's beyond your abilities.  GameSpot has created a good video indicating the major issues as well:  http://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiii-for-pc-has-basically-no-graphic/1100-6422856/   If you would just dedicate a few extra work hours to fixing these problems, you could change the reviews on the store page from 'MOSTLY NEGATIVE' to 'MOSTLY POSITIVE'. If you deliver on this it will pay off, I promise you.  Many people who purchased this game will not purchase the sequels and many who are on the verge of purchasing this product; will not because of the reasons listed above.  Please Square Enix, we all know you can make things right!",1
"Scary at a lot of moments, i had to stop playing in broad daylight at one point haha xD love it! :3",1

"Just like any other HOG I've bought I got this on a sale.  This is the 3rd in and last HOG in the Nightmares From The Deep series. Out of all three this one is my favorite HOG in the Nightmares series. In this HOG u will be learning secrets about the man that is behind everything Davey Jones himself.  Everything was awesome about this HOG. The graphics are pretty, the music awesome, and the BG very nice. The VA wasn't the best. In particular Cory's VA was the one I didn't like. Thankfully Davey Jones VA I liked a lot:)  Also there is a bonus story to play:) The bonus story like the second in the Nightmare series takes place at the end of the game.   All in all u should not miss out in this amazing HOG. This was just a fun one to play and also clocked the longest for any HOG I've played so far.",1

"Really fun game. DLC is also worth the play throughs. I like the combat system even though it is pretty easy to never die. You have to try hard to die in this game with how the combat works and all your abilities.   Story is good. Cinematics are also good. I played through it twice including the DLC's twice. Definitely liked it.  There are always those that want hardcore games. This is not one. Controls are easy to master, combat is easy to master and then you are just off destroying orcs. It is medieval fun and riding caragors is pretty cool too.  Definitely worth the price and the DLC is definitely worth getting.",1
Harder than CSGO and fun to re-visit.,1
"Really fun, but the story falls behind by a large margin behind the original game.",1

"Better gameplay than the first, not quite as good story. I didn't cheat to finish this one, so I think overall I liked it better.",1

"I'm a patron for lizarts. Which means I've put in more money in this project than the selling price. I wish I could tell you all that this is a fantasic story, with great artwork and music. But I can't. So let me get the good things out of the way.  The voice acting is premium. If you want fantastic voice actors and that's all you care about then you're gonna love this.  The art is pretty good. I won't say it's top tier but it's not bad.   With that let's talk about the story. It's a scam. This is not a hard Scifi, this is an X-men/Heroes Plot. This is Science Fantasy masquerading behind the few brief moments of SciFi. The concept and question posed at the beginning NEVER get addressed. There are plot holes and twists everywhere, it's like trying to throw a ball straight and having it go in every direction but the one we thought it would. Up down left right, behind you. It's a story with no form and a weak foundation. I bashed my head and rolled my eyes through it.   I have 3 main reasons why I believe I wasn't able to like or endorse Memory's Dogma. They are as follows.   1. The beginning of Memory's Dogma hit home as a strong SciFi, human fundamentalist plot. We were led to believe it for almost the entire 5th day. there were no implications to suggest that it would transition into Science Fantasy and when it did it was harsh and sudden. The brashness made me lose my faith and trust in the writer. The switch to fantasy ruined any hope of seeing or feeling my humanity in the story. It shattered my suspense of disbelief, I no longer believed the events were possible inside their own world and especially within mine. Specifically the armed man and the reveal of powers brought this story into the fantasy realm and thus losing the solid foundation to ask any real questions.   2. the characters acted in a manner that was counter to realistic logic. I'll give two examples. Hiroki tried committing suicide in order to get to Sorano but why? It was common knowledge that the dead's memories are stored for 49 days after their death. Shouldn't he invested his efforts into speaking with her there? The reason given was that he was unable to face her but yet that was his goal with attempted suicide. If he believed the only way he could stand to see her was to atone with his life then he was delusional with self-hatred and grief which leads to an emotionally unstable MC. But once he wakes up after a suicide attempt, he engages in rational conversation as if nothing is wrong with him instead of being despondent   3. There is a scene that brings together all the negative aspects of MD. That is the bombing scene and it broke me. It goes as follows: We run into the cosplayers on the street for the first time. They are looking for directions. we tell them off and no. They say they are in a hurry and then a bomb goes off. Everyone starts running, fast paced music goes. Tensions are high because our friend might be caught in the bombing. There is a police officer obstructing us. We get to the scene, and queue casual music.   Our friend that we worried about casually said hello to us, the police officers on the scene casually chat with us, there is no one else at the scene even though sirens were said to be going off and going in the direction. Absolutely no one is worried about another bomb going off, no one seems shocked, deaf, or pumped full of adrenaline, no one feels like they just risked their life and no one cares that people probably died. Let's just all sit here and have a nice cup of tea, reminisce about that bombing, and enjoy the smoke going off in our background. Mind you these are  police officers  that have never met you or your friends before and just previously tried to prevent you from entering the scene. Just casually chatting with you.   Suddenly dramatic music kicks back in. There is a swordsman coming at you, the cosplayers quickly behind him. there is a bystander in the way, let's cut her in half, and then he reaches us and we learn... That his sword is attached to his ♥♥♥♥ing arm. Once he gets five meters to the group he stops and enters a fighting stance.  Towards  the unarmed group. The police then take out theirs guns and aim at the guy with the sword arm that just killed a civilian. No surrender, drop your weapon, put your hands up. Just take aim. Cosplayers catch up, battle scene commences, cosplayers lose. Apparently that spear is real and they too have special powers. Main heroine runs away, and MC gains magical super healing powers by Microchip that manipulates your Dna after being brutally stabbed in the stomach by the armed swordsman.",-1
Really dumb 'game'. Game is too easy and short (in my opinion).,-1
"Game takes a while to really ramp up to get consistantly funny/creepy with it's jumpscares. Expect nearly nothing to happen until rooms 175-200.      I also felt that they revealed the whole 'cabin in the woods' storyline far too early, as it is quite a while before you see any spooky scary ghosts   ",1

"Definitely one of the best games in the Dragon Ball VG series. There are some problems here and there, but for the most part it's a pretty fun game.   Cons: I've just started the game and I can already tell that the lobby idea they were going for is going to be a problem. I've already been disconnected from it several times, or not been able to connect at all. Sort of like SimCity was on launch, it seems like they should have been able to correct their server connectibility problems before they released it to the public, but it's nothing new with most modern games so it can be overlooked. If only they would give you the option of playing it offline I wouldn't have even considered it too much of a con really, but you can't even play it offline at all which is a shame.  The difficulty curve is kind of all over the place. One mission will be a steamroll where you just annihalate everyone, but the next one you'll end up having to replay 3 or 4 times to get it right. For people that get frustrated easily well, prepare to get frustrated when that happens.  No more combos like the old Budokai games had, but combos where on their way out anyways from what could be seen in the Tenkaichi series. Just pressing the light attack button over and over, and throwing in a heavy attack here or there, is enough. For people that would prefer an indepth fighter, this one has been pretty much streamlined so you won't find that here.  Pros: The graphics are very true to the show, and are pleasing to the eyes. I had to turn motion blur off, but other than that it looks incredible.  The game's plot is NEW for a change. No more rehashed story missions; each one has small changes that make it play out completely different, and the time travel angle is really well implemented here. The central hub idea was a really great idea, but for people who would rather just jump in and play without worrying about custom characters or the hub world it's not so great, because the toki toki city area is unavoidable and must be visited to really do anything, making local matches take a bit more time than they should. For players who just want to fight, there really should have been a VS. option at the main menu or something.  I LOVE the voice overs for the characters. In Parallel Timeline missions they will talk to each other, and comment on your character depending upon what race you play and if the characters have history with one another. Really awesome.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  TL;DR This game is well worth the price, but if you don't really care for GT's characters I would just ignore the DLC for now, until it goes on sale. This game is a must for fans of the series, and plays very well.",1

"Possibly the most organic dual-mode game that has come out in the past few years. The strategic mode leaves you researching and contructing a bunch of toys to use and looking forward to the missions where you'll get new resources and things to research, and the tactical missions leave you with new enemy after new enemy and all sorts of items to bring back. It evokes the feel of the original very well. I'm not the biggest fan of the change to a much more colourful and Fisher-Price type look of the tech and in particular the weapons, which all look like childrens toys, but otherwise the visual look and feel is implemented very well and perhaps just as importantly consistently. The game just gels very well together in terms of gameplay, visual design, and sound design. The production values are high and so is the fun. The only real thing I felt was a misstep other than some elements of the visual design is the difficulty. While the original could be tortuous sometimes and some scaling back was probably neccesary in today's gaming market, the game is actually pretty easy on all but the highest difficulty, as long as you stick with troops with good stats and stay on top of research and production of new weapons. One of the disappointing things for me in that regards was the chrysallids. In the original they were Aliens-inspired creatures that would zombify your men or civillians, and when you killed the zombie a new chrysallid would emerge. It made things very frantic when you saw one. Comparatively, the new chrysallids look and feel very different. While they do have an instant-kill melee attack (the originals actually didnt, except insofar as they hit like a brick s**thouse), the zombies are mostly unthreatening enemies and there's no extra chrysallid when you kill them. It effective neuters what was one of the original games greatest threats, because of how quickly a chrysallid could ambush and spawn more chrysallids.  Those gripes aside, its an engaging and well-done game which remains a time sink for me to this day. The only turn-based strategy game in the last decade which has had me going 'just one more turn'",1

Have you wanted to be neo from the matrix and dodge bullets?  Well you still can't at least not in real life. However this game gives you the ability to dodge bullets throw cups and smack people with bats. This game is one of the most incredible game i have played. If i still haven't convinced you to buy this game then what if i told you that in this game you could...  Throw a katana at a man with a shotgun grab his gun spin around the shoot his friend in the head spin around again throw the shotgun at someone else grab their pistol shoot them throw your gun in the air and just start punching people.   So if this doesn't sound like your kind of game then i would like to recomend that you go and play something like gamedev tycoon.,1

"Beautiful game, great puzzles, incredible audio design and story. Not without flaws, though; while it seems open-ended and not every puzzle per area is required to move on, the ending requires you to backtrack and finish any puzzles you missed. In addition, there's a choice at the end and you can only make one; resuming your save takes you directly to the credits.  These small issues don't detract too much from the overall game, though, and what a game it is; innovative puzzles and a great experience. Recommended.",1

"I will keep this short, no point in going what everyone else has already said, just simple highlights. Also no Pro/Cons, just words describing stuff:  # PRICING  * The pricing model is kinda fair, you get a log in reward, one of them is 75% discount for the ingame currency. This is THE ONLY TIME it is fairly priced, but it's a very often reward, no need to fret, and when it's 75% off it's honestly a good deal. * Except for needing equipment slots (if you buy at 75% off it's like 25 cents) everything in the shop is fair: Anything non cosmetic drops, some cosmetics (helmets) also drop. Cosmetics are mostly really cheap. * Except for the whale bait 'Prime Access', everything is fairly priced, better than most games, and even the prime access is not so bad (everything it gives is also introduced as a drop in the game, except for a unique cosmetic). * BEST PART: You can trade the real money currency, trading with players is hella clunky, but it works and is by far the cheapest way of getting anything and everything you need.  # Diablo Space Ninja Extravaganza  * This is a diablo-like game, you get loot drops, currency, enhancement stuff. The stats are fixed so it's IMHO infinity times better than diablo in this regard. * The drops are a bit of a grind, but everything is fair or at least resonable.  # Upgrade mechanics  * In this game your power comes form two things: Equipment level (which at this point is near-irellevant beyond giving you extra 'mod capacity', not a difficult grind at all. * The real power comes from mods. They take a 'meh' weapon and make it a weapon of mass destruction. However getting all the right mods is a grind (strong grind). However most are really cheap if you trade with other players (ingame currency or other rare mods). * Some mods (great ones) are event exclusive so you either won't have them or cost an arm or a leg (they are not REALLY needed though).  # Game is wide but not deep  * The mechanics of the game are quite simplistic. The only real depth comes from weapon variaty and warframe abillities. That being said, game is not very deep, it is however unfathomly wide. 300 hours in and I still haven't touched a bunch of stuff (no derelict missions, haven't finished progression trough the map, no drako whatevers, no pet dog).  # Customizability  * If you play MMOs or diablo-likes for the 'dress up' (admit it, that's what you REALLY like), then this game is for you. The customizability is off the charts.  # Replayability  * Yes, loads. Don't over do it, you can get burnt-out. I have friends with 1200 hours on record and they still play the game. Yes, it is replayable to no end.  # Gameplay  * Space NINJAS * Space ... Ninjas * Space Ninjas .... IN SPACE! * Dogs. Space Dogs (sadly no space corgy #cowboyBebop)  # Conclusions  * Is it worth your time ?   * If you don't mind some grind and diablo-esque stuff (with space ninjas in space that have space dogs), yes! * Is the pricing model ok ?  * I don't like prime access, but only on a conceptual level, it takes nothing from my enjoyment. The pricing model is amazing besides the small 'unlock slots' stuff. It's dirt cheap but it forces you to buy some real money currency early on in the game. But again, this is one of the most fairly priced freemium games out there.  That is all.",1
"A Quick summary of my first playthrough.  I entered the randomly generated world, and looked around in wonder at the sprawling landscapes before me in every direction. I then ran into the nearest village, and stole all the boots I could find.  After dodging a balloon, only to be spotted by another balloon, I shot a robot in the face so hard his beard fell off.  I then hid behind a tree and ate a dead rat, which killed me.   11/10.",1
"This game is incredibly cute and has really solid game play with fun little secrets you can unlock. I have played games I paid money for that I didn't enjoy as much as this. It's quick, but you can spend some extra time at the end marrying everyone as they all have unique dialogue. My favourite is marrying Frallan, though marrying both the Ducklord and Dark Lord was pretty neat as well.   10/10 would marry every NPC including spiders, flowers, chests, Mummies, a Seal of Quality, an Apathic Frog, a Moonbunny, a child named shark that magically turn 18 and my own mother again.",1

"was good. but now, i feel sorry for the newbies",-1
"MY EYES! They hurt after playing this game on high intensity in the dark.  but in all honesty, this is a fine game that lets you play a twin-stick shooter to your own songs. It has a multiplayer mode(though both players need the same music unless you just want to play with the radio) it's mildly challenging and has a level up system. A solid buy for people who want to do something with their music.  Just don't play it in the dark if you don't want your eyes to fry.",1
"well, it didn't lie about it being realistic.",-1
Get this game. Do some flips n ♥♥♥♥ while playing football in cars.,1
Great mod with a real 'The Walking Dead' vibe to it. Recommended as its free.,1
Highly recommend awesome simulation.,1
Still better than AC: Unity.,1
"Not the longest game I've ever played, but still great fun. Completed the story in a few hours, but there is a lot more to do and look at if you take your time on each area. Deffinetly recommend especially at the sale price.",1
Fun little game that you can get many hours of enjoyment from. Highly reccomended.,1
"The thing about multiplayer, is that there have to be multipler players...",-1
"I hate games like this. Its like core CoD only with NERF guns. It has so much potential but because of the bad combat system, I hate it. You can land 15-20 hits and still not kill an enemy. I guess since I prefer games like Battlefield, Insurgency, and (old) CoD games, this just isn't for me.    If you like bullet sponge games, fast paced and cartoony, you will like it.  Me, personally I like more realistic games...I only play Hardcore on BF and CoD, and I LOVE Insurgency...   If it had a hardcore/less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty mode, I could get into it",-1
"the game is pretty fun! it getting addicting once you progress into the story, must get game! and you want to play with your friends get dont starve together",1

Great graphics and game play! I really enjoyed playing this game!,1
"My Marks for the best things to get ready for this game: 1:Turn off every light in you're room(Like:Lamps,Fans with laters on top with them,etc.) 2:Grab a Soda of any kind 3:A robe or a blanket 4:Do it at night 5:Have a Flashlight 6:Grab a FNaF Thing(Like:Fan-Made Plushie,Plushie,Action Figure,Fan Art) 7:Tell you're self you are ready 8:(You don't have to do this,but if you feel like it,JUST DO IT)If you're a kid at the age 6-10,tell them that you're playing FNaF(But not the Sister Loaction becasue they might say no).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That's all the steps to have a good exprience with Five Nights at Freddy's:Sister Loaction!",1
"The look and music sold me, but the intro videos didnt completely convince me and left me wondering if I was going to waste $25. Took a little bit to get me completely engulfed into the story line and understand what was going on. But I must say after 2 hours of playing I am completely hooked and highly, HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyes D&amp;D, final fantasy tactics, Tolkien and Disney movies/stories.   Very fun so far and I actually cannot wait to play through a second time with a different demeanor.  Well worth the $25 I paid for it.",1
"Excellent game with a great story, character development, and soundtrack!  It knows when to be witty or sarcastic, and knows when to be serious!",1
One of the best MMORPGs now on Steam! Everyone should try this out ^^,1
This is a pretty good Game But i didn't play it too much since u get bored pretty fast.,1
"Best RPG yet! The turn based combat system is awesome. Graphics and music are top notch! Great storyline, characters and skill system, plus co-op play! What an amazing Kickstarter game! Larian definitely deserves all those awards for Divinity OS. Simply cannot wait for the Enhanced Edition!",1
Played as ghost robots. Assimilated some spiders. Rekt my friend. 11/10 would assimilate spiders again. (There is an issue i have that flying units cant get over the sea. That is stupid.),1
"First impression will have you in awe and bewilderment. Your adventure takes place in a primitive mysterious structure and after the initial cut-scene you're dropped into this world.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsK6fdmSH2g   From here its time to explore and find a way out. The design of the world has a cool aesthetic sci-fi feeling and vibe and the visual direction is superb. If you like games with exploration and a sense of wonder, then you'll feel right at home with this game. - Highly Recommended!",1
"There something very annoying with the hitting animations most of the time out of sync, makes you spend another hit for nothing since monsters dies in between. Kinda important in hardcore mode... Also special zones are very frustrating in Hardcore + Cruel mode, not really a challenge more of a suicide since sometimes you just have no chances against the randomized abilities of the boss. Drops don't seems to scale either at this point, takes forever to have something slightly better.",-1
"Extremely fun co-op game, I really liked playing it, pity my pc is broken though.",1
i will always love you &lt;3,1
"1, 2, 3. Why is this so hard, Valve?",1
"I didn't even know games could do this and I have played a lot so far, even the Stanley Parable.   Suffering from depression does not make this game easier but the impact is huge.  ",1
"'Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an 'unsatisfactory' mark on your official testing record, followed by death. Good luck!'- GlaDOS  I love this game.....  I love it so much I am at a loss for words. (just like chell lol, sorry) Anyway, this game has everything you could possibly desire; food, sarcasm, robots, turrets, crazy-scifi-portals, a companion cube, great graphics, an interesting storyline, puzzles everywhere, and plenty of 'easter eggs' for those looking closely enough.  Enough said, just go buy it!",1
The best of the series.,1
It's avery nice game good graphics and easy to play ,1
"What can I say that already hasn't been said? Not only one of the greatest shooters ever made, but also one of the greatest games of all time.",1
I think this game is so much fun i have a really bad computer mine still runs after a few settings have been changed but i still have loads of fun its the best gta game ever,1
"It is a woefully overlooked game. The gameplay is like a more action packed halo with buildable and destructable terrain. While the graphics aren't the best, the community is small and strong. You'll get more than your money's worth.",1
i actually happen to love NMS i give it 8/10 in my book! i see the potential in NMS and hope sean continues to update it i'd be cool to see what other things they add!!!,1
"This is the best open world game ever.  Forget GTA series, this is the one you must play, it has action, bad language, humor, dark humor, explosions, character customization is perfect.  You MUST play this game.",1
"Well, i brought a echii anime fighter and god i got what i wanted, i wish there were more characters or that you could use the strikers as main characters but they are unique enough so that doesn't really matter to me, it's just mindless fun if you play it with your friends, not bad for 5 bucks, and really good for the $3.75 i pay for it.",1
Don't give bunnies the shaft. They've got serious issues and a taste for death metal and human flesh. 10/10,1
This game is really fun and its even better if you play it with friends!,1
Fun and simple game. Good to play while waiting for friends to get online.,1
this game is badass,1
2 parts classic DOOM. 1 part original QUAKE. Turned up to 11.,1
"It's one of those games where when you die, you get so frustrated but you want to keep playing. You never know what's going to happen on your next run.  It's an incredibly fun game and I recommend it to anyone who has been considering getting it.",1
"This game is verie good, very sick i luv it",1
"This game is great, The whole ARMA series is great esspecially arma 3 but this is about arma 2 OA which has very good feel to it with different mods such as island life or the classics like dayz mod after gamespy shutdown everyone was thinking or not if arma would become dead and if it would be ruined in my opinion the game still has the same potential as it did before and the expectation i had when i first got it exceeded mine so i would reccomend this game for the great graphics, idea, and how the gun works 12/10",1
Great re-boot of a classis masterpiece! You WILL get immersed into the story. The voice acting is good in addition to updated graphics.  The included graphic novel and behind the scenes extras are excellent 'bang for your buck' bonuses.  See my video review below.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhhgobXbmj8 ,1
Just a word: boring.,-1
"At first I didn't care for the game, however I went back and played it a few months later and loved it.   Pros  -Great graphics -Free roam -Great fighting animations -Not very demanding on hardware  Cons  -Difficult -Button mashing fighting style  -once you upgrade the car completely there is very little room for personalization   Could be good or bad  -constant fighting  -Lots of sand  -Much killing -much dying  All in all a great game",1
"amazing game when it first came out, but people quickly forgot about it so the servers are all pretty much dead, If they had included split screen, i could definitly see myself playing this with friends on the couch ",-1
No one plays this online making purchasing it worthless. There is a small community that still plays but the more you play the more you realize it's more luck than skill and I lost interest.  If you don't have a group of people to play with you won't be playing.,-1
"The game is nice and hase potentiall but the community,bugs,glitches,just ruin the game ! I recommand it for someone who has got a lot of nerves. LOL is (community speaking better) than dota2. Now don't start hating cus' This was MY FIRST MOBA i ever played. Most of the experienced players nedd to play whit n00bs + 1/3 of the characters are OP : SpiritBreaker,Rikkimaru,Sniper,Drowranger,etc which makes the game (maches) a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ ! I am ♥♥♥♥ing over whit DotA. I played the first wich was amazing but as soon it came in the hands of valve the game changed into better exept the community wich downgraded so hard that even lion digs in Hell for it . That is all , it used to be fun !",-1
CloudIsEdgyAs♥♥♥♥/10,1
great game really fun but they need more wings,1
I love this game but a bug keeps crashing the game...,1
If you played the original DS2 but still want more from it/get back into then this is worth ht money. Honestly I didnt notice the graphical change but the changed they did to enemies is enough to keep me excited so far into the game,1
I can slice people up.  10/10 will slice it again,1
If you like to deal with UBIsoft the game isn't real bad. But the overlays are horrendous. Updated. The overlays finally got manageble. Ubisoft modified them several times. The game is not bad at all but ubisoft 3rd party drm is horrible.,1
"One of games that on start you think it will be another stupid indie, but no. This is one of most amazing ideas i have seen; old style arena with great music, amazing, simply and neon graphics and of course fantastic gameplay. There is fun even playing with bots!  Everything that this game needs is more players and developer, who will not stop evolving this game, cause he is doing great job.  Oh, I almost forget; there are  mustaches .",1
"very disapointed, was a really boring and clunky game",-1
"This game is amazing, it is so complete and so much fun I can't do it justice trying to decribe it here. It performs beautifully in an SLI rig. This is the kind of stable, high performance coding that all game developers need to learn a lesson from. To anyone on the fence about buying this game, pull the trigger. It will be the best game in your library,",1
"Arcade-like zombie killing at it's finest. Plenty of fun, unique classes to level up and master and plenty of fun to be had in this zombie killing game!",1
"One of the best strategy game in existence which only lacks in certain points. Taking direct control of units, the vehicle damage model, all makes this a very special game.  However, voice acting in the campaign is... unbearable and the campaign in itself is not impressive. This game is clearly made for multiplayer.  Though, the sheer amounts of mods that exist and are being created fixes most of these. Probably half my gameplay is of playing mods. I'd suggest Moddb for finding these.  Should you buy this game? I would say yes, but if you can wait then i should wait till assault squad 2, which seems to improve a lot of problems. For me, definatly worth the buy. 10/10  ",1
Do you even remember why you came here?,1
"A good game. It's short but tells a sweet story of a girl and a fox trying to find the origin of the continuous blizzards in her village. There's a lot of cultural videos of the Inupiat you can watch, but if you're not into that, you can skip them. They're there for background information and don't support the story. I played on PC and it was fine, but I can imagine the controls working more fluently with a controller. I did experience some glitches where I fell through the stage a couple of times, but nothing more than that.",1
This game is amazing!,1
"Despite the game being one of my favorites, I thought that after all these years the lag issue would be fixed. But as the name suggests, it seems only the graphics were updated. The lag becomes unbearable once too many units are on the map. There is a few second delay between every frame.",-1
"I have Mafia II, why did I play this?",-1
"I adore this game! At first I didn't think it'd run on my computer, but everything works as smooth as ever! And my laptop is pretty old!   The game controls are easy to use once you get use to them, no complain from me.   I'd say if you love the anime, you'll love this game. It's addicting!",1
"I have never reviewed a game, or any product. But this game deserves a review. If you're bored with typical cookie-cutter games which are 99.9% of games today, buy The Magic Circle. It has a creativity matched by games like Psychonauts and Morrowind.",1
best fps shooting game EVER  and great graphic in 2005,1
If you can actually log in its ok,-1
it's damn cool,1
"9/10  This is my own opinion on this game.  I haven't had so much fun on a game thats a MMO RPG in a long time. I was never really interested in these types of games, but this game is differant. I've spent 2 days on this game, already own a 30 members club. Level 12, 15 hours on record. Since its not PVP I found it really alot more interesting. Making new friends and bringing your ciurrent friends along for an adventure. Or making a castle in your club world, or trying to create a dragon. This is your game, but there are some bad things about this game. For a game that doesn't look top notch it drags down my computer. Their are only 3 serves Europe, North America and PTS-America. It takes about 30 minutes to join the server daytime, this game is truly great its servers needs some fixing it probably needs more country servers like Asia and probably another north America server. I can see this game getting boaring.  Thank you ladies and gentleman for reading.  P.S My grammar is terrible.",1
TREE OF SHUTDOWN GAME DOESNT OPEN AFTER UPDATE WTF,-1
"This is the third time I have given these people money for this game. Will do it a fourth time, if it comes out on phones. Would like to see the sequels, but no hurry, guys, this one will take me about a year to get through. 10/10",1
if you havent played this by now... well.... shame on you!,1

"A lot of people are comparing this to P.T. saying its a copy but this guy has been making games like this for a good while now. Compared to his other ones this one is the best in my opinion, although jumpscares are something I do love.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDA6CKMhT0w   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euOKMojHJ7M ",1
"I've been with this game since the begining. As you could probably guess by the irresponsible amount of hours I've put into the game, I absolutly love it and have gotten more than my money's worth. I haven't gotten around to writting a review because of the huge number of changes that the game has undergone and I was waiting until I felt confident in giving my opinion on it. And it breaks my heart that I finally am confident enough to give it a review, and I feel I have to give it a thumbs down  The basic premis of the game is 4 people play as survivors, 1 as a killer. Survivors try to turn on 5 generators to power the exit gates and escape, the killer tries to hit them twice to knock them down, than hang them on hooks to sacrifice them. It's fairly straight foward and predictable in its exicution, with 4v1 a killer can't keep a close eye on all the gens so survivors can turn them on, but as their numbers fall so to does their chances of avoiding the killers detection. Matches start with survivors trying to make as much progress as possible before one of them is caught, killers will use anyone they catch as bait to lure in the others, or simply keep them from making progress on the gens. There will be some slight variation based on what items, perks, and what killer is in play but people tend to gravitate towards the same set of perks and items. Sadly this can make the game get stale and repetitive very quickly. Though there can be unexpected turns as you can never see inside the head of 4 different people, the game has become less exciting, more predictable, and overall less enjoyable as the game has been updated  My biggest problem with the game has always been it's balance issues. When the game first launched there where places survivors could reach that would make it LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to catch them. All they needed was a place with 2 or more windows to jump through and the killer cound not catch up to them. That problem has for the most part been remidied and for a long time I enjoyed being a killer more than a survivor (helped by the fact that I was far better at being a killer than a survivor.) At this point the game was for the most part balanced, there were still a few kinks in the game and matchmaking but I saw a willingness in the devs to adress these issues and hade hope they would be fixed. Sadly the recent updates to the game have unbalanced the game further and changed it to the point where I'm no longer finding joy in being a killer (something that is not uncommen to hear but more on that later)  The first change that started to change the game for the worst in my eyes was the addition to a chat room at the end of matches. When the game first launched the only way to communicate was with other survivors in a chat before matches started. Now killers and survivors can chat eachother at the end of matches. A lot of people use this in good faith. You laugh with eachother at the mistakes you all made, you point out a glitch that happened that screwed someone over, you say gg, and then move on. But too many people don't act this way.   My time as a killer in the weeks following this have been filled with trolls, harrasment, and general awful behavior. If someone is killed early in the mathc its not unlikely for them to stick around so that they can hurl insults at me and say how ♥♥♥♥ I am for doing something wrong that gave me to much of an advantage. Manage to keep track of someone for a long period of time, it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and you cheated. Used a perk that they don't like, they'll be sure to point out that you only got your rank by using 'Cheap perks,' like I shouldn't use my best perk set, like I have an obligation to give the survivors an edge. I play at College, so the internet conecction is spotty. God help you if you lag because you will be torn to ♥♥♥♥ing shreds if you kill someone while lagging. I've been accused of manipulating lag, making survivors lag to give me an edge, I've been told I only got my rank by using lag, and just plain insulted, told that I need to get better internet or I shouldn't be allowed to play killer. If I do bad in a match, because I messed up or the survivors were just better than me, I've come to expect the survivors to treat me like ♥♥♥♥. I've been accused of artificially boosting my rank, of buying this account to have a boosted rank, and it kind of sucks the fun out of playing killer when doing bad will get you buried under a mountain of abuse and accusations. I'm not even Rank 10. I'm not even half way to Rank 1 and I still get accused of boosting my rank if I do bad in a match. Oh and simply playing the Nurse with the perk 'No One Escapes Death,' is grounds for some people to call you ♥♥♥♥ for using something thats 'OP.' Even if you don't kill anyone. You can still get torn down for using something someone else demed OP. All of this has led to me dreading the end of matches knowing that this abuse is coming, and to me trying to click out of the results screen as soon as a mathc ends so that I don't have to deal with this, and that sucks so much enjoyment out of the game for me.  Recent updates to the game have unbalanced the game in favor of survivors. Killer's have had the effectiveness of their items lessened, The effective range on some of their perks have decreased, it takes less time to heal survivors making it easier for them to be rescued. Survivors can now free their friends from the killers grasp by blinding them, making it easier to rescue friends, while similtaniously making a perk that as a negative side effect makes you easier to blind a far more risky perk to use. To be fair Killers have had a few new items added to their arsenal but it doesn't compare to what the survivors have had added to them. The game isn't so unbalanced that it's impossible for killers to win, but it is so unlikely that I can't remember the last time I witnessed a killer get all 4 survivors, and I haven't gotten all 4 in ages.  And all this leads to the problem of people no longer wanting to play the killer. It's not just me, more and more people are starting to quit playing killer or leave the game entirely. Today when I tried to play as a survivor it could take more than 20 minutes to find a match, not because of the games servers and lobies, I could find survivors when playing killer in seconds, but just because there were not enough people playing killer for the amount of people trying to play survivor. That situation could be leathal to the game. Some people are already demanding AI killers, which I think would only continue to drive people away from playing killer, making the game a shell of what it was. If no one plays killer, if the game eliminates the need for playing killer than half of the game dies. And there's a load of smaller issues that are so numerous I won't even try to list them or explain them all.  Dead by Daylight was never a masterpiece. Even at its best it was plauged by bugs and balance issues. Despite all this I loved the game, I still do. But in its current state I can not reccomend playing it, even if you got it super on sale. And that makes me sad. To have a game I love so much get to a point where I can't reccomened it to the average person really does break my heart. If things improve my opinion may change, but as of now, do not buy.",-1
"Incredibly fun. I love playing this game, and have a hard time putting it down.",1
"The best game EVER! Buy it now, then buy it again just because it's so awesome. Revan &lt;3",1
One of the best adventure games of 2013. Thoroughly enjoyed playing it.  It's a real shame that that the next Tomb Raider is going to be an Xbox exclusive.  ,1
"Cool story, cool graphics, and solid shooting.",1
I didn't play much of this but my brother said it was well worth the £2 that I paid for it. I plan on getting into it at some point though because I love stealth based gaming. I will however say that what I played of it was hit and miss. Take from that what you will.,1
If you ever played the impossible game thats what this is but with a lot more hazards. Very hard but was still fun.   Check out some no commentary game play to see the game for yourself.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXPdRXjayo ,1

THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE REVIVED. ESPORTS IS BECOMING MASSIVE AND THIS SHOULD BE A FRONT RUNNER. RENAME RERELEASE OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO GET SOME MORE EXPOSURE OUT THERE,1
"Probably the most fun I've had with the Vive. However, if the game didn't keep score at all, people would be upset. There's a MUCH BIGGER FLAW here that NO ONE is talking about. You can just hold both shields at your chest and get a perfect score. The developer really needs to fix this. Only after, will it be almost perfect.",1
"Meh. Just another 2D retro exploration thing. Might have been good and unique when it first came out, but no in 2015, one can easily find as good stuff or better as free web browser games.",-1
"Albert and Otto is a platformer-puzzle game with the world set in Germany. It has a tremendous story line which makes the player imply fully for saving the missing girl. The graphics are medium and there are only black and white tones. The game intensifies when red shades appear, making the game more colorful and emphasing the purpose of the game.  The mechanics are not very complicated, but they incite the player to think logical for solving the puzzles. Clues about the story are hidden through the gameplay, making it more interesting. The combinations of superpowers learned in the meantime while playing stimulate the player to consider all the possibilities in order to solve the problems.  As a conclusion, Albert and Otto has a motivating story line and is a great choice for puzzle-solving lovers or people who like to think.",1
Like Gears of War for 40k. Loved it. Brings the 40k world to life.,1
pretty good 7/10,1
i loved this game it has a lot of felling and a great story,1
I just wished they removed GFWL.,1
Left 4 Dead with cops instead of zombies.,1
Never thought about playing this new stupid genre of 'Clicker games' until I found one with waifus in it.  10/10,1
I got into the MGS series when my brother introduced me to it and since the last 5 years he has been waiting I can say It was worth the wait,1
"I stayed away from TL2 for a long time, fearing that it'd be nothing more than a mindless hack and slash. In ways that's exactly what it is - it's been called 'what Diablo III should have been', but there is some strategy here. The choices you make in how to equip your character do matter, and the game itself is enjoyable.  There's no sandbox world here, though so far it seems large enough. Basic gameplay consists of undertaking quests with your hardy pet companion, beating the snot out of whoever gets in your way, stealing their loot and getting rewarded for it. Overall you're chasing after a bad guy called the 'Alchemist' who I'll assume wants to do bad guy things. I haven't played Torchlight, which makes me feel like I'm missing a little something of the plot - but not enough to affect my enjoyment of the game.  Your pet....is awesome, and probably one of the best companions/allies I've ever had in any RPG ever. I chose a cat, and he just wades into the thick of the melee. In the demo version I gave him a spell and he sat back with me fireballing everything that looked at us funny. Sometimes in battles I'd have to stand back to let my hit points recover. My cat would literally claw his way out, tearing a hole through the enemies and I swear give me a look that said 'wuss.'  Don't expect meaningful plot choices or a hundred subplots (though there are side missions.) That said, if you want to kill some stress by wading into an army of ratlings/skeletons/spiders/politicians and coming out bloodied but unbowed, this game's for you.",1
Good game for any hardcore with ton of times to die and repeat! Not easily to beat even with experience,1
"Nice atmosphere, worth a shot since it's free.",1
"This game wasn't what I expected to buy, however that doesn't make it a 'horrible' game, I would still recommend it. If you ever played Legion: Legend of the Excalibur, Baldurs Gate and more on the PS2, as well as Diablo, this game is reminiscent of those gameplay styles but in it's own, more simplified fashion. Combat is simple and straightforward, is fun and can keep you entertained throughout most of the game. It does tend to get a little repetitive at times, but swapping allies and changing equipment builds can help ease that. The part that's probably lacking the most is the story, which is the main focus of the game. The story isn't very original, the 'cutscenes' are all flash animated paintings or drawings, hardly ever if at all do you get a close-up of the characters, giving an absence of connection with the story and characters in my opinion. However, I'm sure you'll be happy killing skeletons, zombies, etc. etc. regardless. It's good to catch on sale, don't pay full price for this game though, it's not worth it.",1
"The game does just throw you in so I can see why people may get frustrated, but the game is actually really fun! It took me about 3 hours to play through the first time with no direction and I had a blast. Figuring out how to beat each boss was a lot a fun, I only wish there was more.",1

"I loved this game more than I imagined I would, but I want to stress something: the game is a great game overall regardless of its difficulty. This game is not just noteworthy for being unforgiving at times: it is an amazingly well-designed game in general. My friend had been trying to get me to play it for years and I finally got around to it.  The level design is possibly the best I have seen in any game. Other games like the Metroid series may have done it first but it is absolutely delightful how so many of the areas interconnect, and opening a shortcut to find out it led back to somewhere I had been in a way I never expected was always extremely rewarding. Aside from two instances   in which you get rings to survive in certain areas   the progression itself is not like Metroid, but the level design most definitely is. It's disappointing to hear the second and third games do not have such a complex interconnected layout, but this game set the bar so high it would be very difficult to match it.  That leads me to another thing about the level design: This is a game that takes place in a three dimensional world. Too many games treat the world as mostly 2D with perhaps a couple floors of height. This game is absolutely massive, and that includes the use of vertical space.  The difficulty was not as bad as I expected. One particular fight did take four hours of attempts to beat, but the game overall was not as consistently difficult as I had expected. While bonfire (checkpoint) placement can be moderately far from a boss battle sometimes, without exception you can learn to run past most of the enemies to get back to a boss battle fairly quickly. I am sure unforgiving difficulty ramps up considerably in New Game+, but I am talking about just a normal run of the game. Fighting bosses in this game is very much akin to the Mega Man series. You learn the moves they can do and how to deal with them, and eventually you take less damage than they do and you win. I am not someone that is into tough games, but it is still very satisfying finally beating a touch foe. My friend put it well: he said the game has a high learning curve and people mistakenly think that means it is very difficult all the way through. The game has tough moments, but most of all I think it is a very fun and satisfying experience.  In short, this game is among the best because it is so incredibly well-designed. That it can be unforgiving at times is not",1

"The Park as a game was more of an eye opener for me than a horror thriller. I could not classify this as a game, as that would assume I was not on rails most of the time. I would have to say this is an immersive movie with controls to get you to the other part of the story.  For only 1:30 hours long, I would have to say I felt like I spent some decent money. The story itself is shocking. There were times that I felt scared to look around a corner, though most of the times, only a weird anamation was there to greet you.  Only advice I could give, is if you are expecting a horror title, turn around. You will only find a mild form of it here. If you would like a story with some horror mixed in, this is the game for you. ",1
" Edit (12/21/2016) - Checked back in on the new IW Reborn 'Gold' update. Just a UI reskin and a new set... sadly, my review remains unfortunately accurate - another four months down the road, and it's still a low pop. game with too many bugs and a dev team more interested in further monetizing than they are in fixing their game.    Original review follows:  Months and months with the new devs, and a ridiculous amount of issues persist:     Dozens of bugs, many of them game-breaking - including wins and losses not registering in ranked play.     Extremely limited draft pool, majority of cards need heavy balancing and are restricted from draft.     Long ranked queues are only getting longer, constant matches against the same players - no matter how many are online.     Even when the devs try to fix something, it rarely works. Such as the three cards 'removed' from ranked a few weeks ago that still pop up.   New dev team seems more interested in putting out new sets, DLC, and (for who knows what reason) tournaments for the ~150 playerbase. Too bad, because this game could be great... and it never will be. Seriously, they've patched all of three bugs since the beginning of the year. Don't waste your time (and money) like I did.",-1

"Really nice game.  You should try it, very fun :D",1
"The M&amp;M series is primarily either an old-school, pen-and-paper style dungeon crawler, or a card game. Meanwhile, Dark Messiah is an oddity; it's a first-person action RPG in the Source engine, of all things! Picture Half-Life 2 with swords and sorcery instead of guns and robots, and you'll have a good idea of what this game plays like. Going into this title, I did not expect much. I knew it was from Arkane Studios, the same folks who delivered the excellent  Dishonored , but all the same I was not prepared to fall in love with the game.   The Story  Most certainly Dark Messiah's weakest aspect. You play as Sareth, an apprentice serving under the wizard Menelag. Your master has sent you to deliver some sort of artifact to a friend in a far off city, but has transported a woman into your conciousness to be your guide for mysterious reasons. Xana is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Cortana from  Halo . You'll either tolerate her character, or outright despise her. Once you actually get to your destination, stuff hits the fan and you're thrust into a campaign to defeat an evil Necromancer. There are quite a few plot twists along the way. The biggest will probably be obvious to you, but I can guarantee there are plenty of left-field ones. The question is... will you even care enough to, well, care about what happens? 6/10   The Gameplay  Ahhh, now here's Dark Messiah's shining beacon of awesomeness. I'm going to be blunt about this one, straight out of the gate: Dark Messiah has the greatest first-person combat I've experienced in a game. The guys at Arkane are  wizards  when it comes to first-person animations; everything is incredibly silky smooth and satisfying to witness and interact with. As you progress through the game, you'll be rewarded Skill Points which you can then distribute as you please through two skill trees. There's no skill that will drastically change up how you play; just some generic 'More HP' or 'Slightly Bigger Fireball'. Still, it works. You can also get some skill points by finding certain secret objectives within the world.  Dark Messiah's level structure is not unlike Doom or Quake... Littered with clever secrets (Some I didn't find until my fifth or so playthrough!) filled with special loot like new armors and weapons. Using either a Sword &amp; Shield, Dual-Daggers, Staves, Bows, or Magic, you'll slice and dice and stab and smash and burn and freeze and electrocute your way through hordes of Mercenaries, Orcs, Giant Spiders, Undead, and more. Though you can mash your attack button, that is rarely effective. The true combat is found using the various styles of power attacks. Not unlike the system found in Elder Scrolls, you'll preform different attacks based on which direction you are moving. From vertical swipes to long reaching stabs to hard-hitting slashes, you'll need to use every available move to defeat the very clever Orcs later on. Swords are nimble; the all-around weapon. They're capable of parrying foes, and you can even disarm by power-attacking while aiming at the hand. Daggers are lightning fast. They chop up foes before they can get a swing in, and they are capable of instant kills against unaware and fleeing enemies. Staves lack damage, but in smart hands they are the most powerful in the game. They can strike multiple foes at once, and blows to the head almost always stun instantly, leaving the foe extremely vulnerable to being kicked off their feet and into traps and the like. Bows work like you'd expect; headshots instantly kill unaware enemies. Once you get the skill that makes you draw faster and a secret unlimited quiver, it's possible to go bow-only, most definitely.  Magic requires a lot of skill to use effectively. Sure, you have your standard fireballs and lightning bolts and freeze spells, but in my experience it is just too difficult to use solely these in combat. You'll need to be crafty; turn enemies against each other with a mind-control spell, shrink enemies to the size of mice, and lay traps near instant-killing spike-walls in the environment.   About a third of the way through the game, you'll find the Rope Bow. Truly an inventive tool that I would adore seeing in another game. Near useless in combat, this weapon is instead used to navigate the environment; firing at any wooden structure above you will release a dangling rope you can climb and jump from! This one simple tool drastically changes up the level structure from there-on, and gives room for some dastardly secret nooks and crannies.  Admittedly, it does take quite a while to get used to how the game works. But I guarantee you... when it all clicks, you'll be saying 'Holy smokes! This is gosh-dang-diddly-dum AWESOME!' 10/10   The Art and the Sound  If you've seen any sort of high fantasy movie, show, comic, or game, you've seen everything in Dark Messiah before. There's nothing visually that is truly original or outstanding. Admittedly, the super weapons later on have some great designs and one of the final levels is a big palette cleanser after hours of trudging through a boring ol' cave system. The environment, the enemies... it's all generic as possible. Thankfully, the sound is a fair bit better. The clang of metal against metal and swooshes of air as swords tear through it are top-notch and really bring a little extra bit of immersion. You'll probably get sick fast of the early Mercenary enemies who seem to always begin a fight with 'Hey, pal!', but the later gruffness of Orcs and Goblins and the like feel a fair bit more threatening. 8/10   The Replayability  Between the many different styles of equipment available, the extremely harsh skill point limit, and the myriad of secrets to be found in every corner, you'll definitely want to play this beast more than once. The average first playthrough will probably take 12-15 hours. There are multiple endings, but trust me; you won't be replaying just to see these. The addictiveness of the combat is far more a reason to do so than the plot. 9/10   In Summary  Dark Messiah came out in 2006, and I played it in 2014. I was WOWed by it, and found myself playing it over five times before getting bored. I legitimately count it among one of my favorite games now. Well worth the low price of admission these days!

I have never had an AC game with such a bad story, which in reality has always been 50% the reason to buy it. The glitches have been fixed though, so don't let that hold you back.   A final tip for those that decide to buy it: play with the hud off! Greatly enhances the experience, it will be easy enough anyway.",-1

"This game is great fun. If you are a long time fan of old-school Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda, this game will be a blast from the past. It also serves as a good introduction to what the action-adventure, action RPG, and JRPG genres were like in bygone days.  Evoland is paced very well. Whenever a person lacking in patience would get tired of one mode of play, the game evolves and presents the player with something new to play with. Even completing all the side quests can be done with only a modicum of extra effort. I would reccommend this game to anyone and everyone.",1
"This is a great game that does not get the love it deserves. The only reason people hate the online mode is because they get matched with horrible people. After a few major updates and patches, the system is much more balanced and not as glitchy. I had several boot issues with the game but its easy to fix by looking it up. Once the fan base grows, this game will be even better. And the DLC charaters are not really over-powered any more. each has a rating now on how easy or hard they are to play and it gives new players a good idea on where to start.",1

"I do recommend this game although I didn't really like it.  The idea behind the game is fantastic. Really upends your expectations at every moment and tries to emotionally connect with the player in ways no other game has tried.  I didn't like the writing. The tone was poor and I just didn't like any of the characters. I definitely got the evil ending because I intentionally killed everybody I could to not have to hear dialogue any more. If the dev found somebody who knew how to write I would have probably loved the game. If they intentionally made them this irritating in order to make the good ending require some sacrifice on the player's part, then that would change everything.  But still, I reommend games based on the quality of their strengths, not their weaknesses. And this is worth playing.",1
"this game may look fun, but it really isnt. first off, Its 2016 and the stay-in-place asteroids arent even somewhat smooth ( there are parts of the asteroid that are just a complete corner, like a cube). Second, theres a glitch where the asteroids dont even come after you, meaning they spawn almost 2,250 meters away, not even being a threat. Third, for some reason, i keep getting attacked when there isnt a single asteroid moving around me. Fourth and most of all, there is no running control, meaning you have to walk almost (referring to the nearest one when you spawn) just about 1,150 meters, at about 3m(m = meters)/1 second; dont even get me started on one of the markers being almost more than 4,500 meters away, which leads to my next arguement. There are invisible walls, everywhere. as if it were a glass maze. think of walking through a mirror house at a carnival, but you cant see yourself; like a vampire, i guess. Sixth, I dont know what it is but there is a whole bunch of gas/dust, making impossible to see. My seventh and final arguement, the hud is barely visible when looking forward. The only way i was able to see it was when i looked straight up. another review was talking about how there was no 'color-blind' feature, and he wanted everything to outlined in thick black, which i can agree with and want. To whoever may read this, I hope this helps you with making sure not to get this game.",-1

"Diablo was the first arpg I played, and the game that left the strongest mark from my childhood. The atmosphere, the music, the inevitability of death, it was just great. Of course, I played plenty Diablo II through my teens, and most arpgs of note since then. No game came close to emulate the feeling I had when playing Diablo, surely not Diablo III, which was a massive letdown. I thouroughly enjoyed titles like Torchlight and Van Helsing, but even those, as good as they are, didn't leave a lasting impression.   Enter Victor Vran, and all of a sudden, I'm 9 years old again, smashing skeletons on a dark, mysterious setting again. This is not a Diablo clone, though, this is much more. It takes what made Diablo such a great game, and redifines it with twists of its own. English is not my native language, and I can't quite find the words to describe how good Victor Vran really is. Let me just say this, if you're looking for an arpg, look no further, for this is the best one you can find today.   ",1

"If you were all over the THPS games back in the PSX and PS2 days, you owe it to yourself to play this. There's a ton of nostalgia packed into this game and it was great to revisit a lot of the old levels and beat all the challenges in career mode.   It's not perfect though. There's really only a few levels spanning the first three games. They really could've included more levels. The graphics are kind of weak and glitchy; the game itself is clumsy and unpolished. You'll spend a lot of time falling, crashing into walls, or getting thrown across the map all for no reason. You'll also end up respawning endlessly over the spot where you got stuck and crashed.   Despite all that this game is loads of fun.",1

"Alien: Isolation provides an extremely faithful re-creation of the Alien universe as seen in the original 1979 film. Thankfully, it also captures the atmosphere and subtleties that made that film so effective. While the plot may play out the same way as in most Alien films and offer few surprises in that sense, Sevastopol as a setting is very rich and engrossing, and is a delight to explore.

"Excellent 10/10  Four Hunters, an Assault, a Support, a Trapper and a Medic have to track down and kill a Monster before he can evolve and destroy them or their base. Play as the hunter or the hunted and pick your perks at the start of the game according to your strategy.  The variation between the classes is excellent with each class having 6 characters, each with very different abilities so it really feels like 24 different characters and not just more of the same. You start with one of each class unlocked and by playing the tutorial can unlock another assault character and the first monster. Then join matchmaking (which by the way is excellent) and find other players according to your level and prefered class after you list your classes in order of preference. As you deploy (and give the monster time to get a headstart) the characters have a brief conversation that gives you little snippets of the lore behind each one which I found a nice touch.  The mechanics of the game feel somewhat similar to Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch except the Graphics are awesome and the Variety of builds is huge. I have found this far more engaging, drawing you in to keep playing, to complete daily challenges, and unlock new characters and perks. This in turn gives you more possible builds and strategies that make you want to play more.  I can hardly believe this game is not only Free to Play but free to win. There is no pay to win here, earn 'keys'/credits by playing, and use these to unlock more perks, charachters and skins, or just wait and unlock by leveling up the characters. The fact that it was originally a paid game just means the developers have had time and funds to get it right!  Pros:  Graphics Variation between classes Variety between characters Variety of builds Variety of tactical options Matchmaking Free to play Free to progress   Cons:  I haven't found any yet.   Lastly, don't listen to all the haters that are mostly just sore that they paid for a game that is now free to play.",1

"most epic piece of epicness that will ever have the word epic epicly put on it, epicness",1
"Oknytt is a lovely point-and-click adventure game in which you play a small creature trying to fine help for his friend, a wingless alva (a fairly-like being). Along the way, the two of you encounter many creatures from Swedish folklore, ranging from the dark and dangerous to the gentle and friendly.  I love fairytales and folklore, and I have to say this game really nailed the feeling of being told a story. Much credit for this goes to the writing and the voicework done by the narrator, but is also due to smaller details in the game design. For example, instead of the standard adventure response 'that won't work' when you try something, the narrator says 'no, that's not what happened.' It's a story, and if you try something that makes sense and it doesn't work, it's not that you're wrong, it's simply not what happened. On the other hand, the game does use fairy tale logic in its puzzle design. To explain: while the puzzles themselves make sense, the reason *why* you're doing them are not always clear. Like a hero in a fairy tale, just help out the creatures and rest assured that you will be helped out in turn, or at least advance the story.  Gameplay is adventure-standard, with cursors to examine, interact, and speak. Interestingly, if the object cannot be spoken to, the player character instead makes a comment about the object from its point of view, while the examine acts more as an objective description. In addition to the standard controls are runes at the bottom of the screen, which cause the environment to change in some way. Note that the character does not change the environment with the runes, but rather you're changing the setting around the character. Both of these design choices add to the feeling of storytelling.  Some miscellany: The art is a little sketchy in places, but it does capture the feeling of old paintings one might find in a book. It's a bit on the dark side, but play in a darkish room (which is fitting anyway) and you'll be alright. The narrator was great, and changed his voice for the different characters (as all good storytellers should!). The player walks incredibly slowly, but make use of double-clicking to travel between areas and this becomes only a minor quibble. The game took me about 6 hours to complete, so it's not very long, but not short either.  Parents: the game is appropriate for older children (minimal violence, no bad language), but just be aware that some of the creatures from folklore sometimes have darkish characteristics (eg. leading travellers astray, etc.) and some have visual designs that may be frightening to some children.  If you've read this far, you should know by now whether this game is for you. I hope it is!",1
"XCOM: Enemy unknown is a turn based strategy game that puts you and your soldiers up against aliens of various types. you start off with basic soldiers that you would expect to see today and through reverse engineering alien tech you get better weapons, armor, and more.  the game has strategy outside the combat as well as you must build your base, shoot down UFO's and keep countries happy or they will withdrawl from the Xcom project.  graphically the game is good and I enjoy the sound design and dialog though the sound effects eventually do get repetitive.  the story is pretty good but feels like it ends a bit abruptly. there are many strategies to win as there are different classes of soldier.  overall the game is enjoyable. is it worth $60? only if you are a turn based strategy fan as you will probably get multiple playthroughs out of it but even novice players should pick it up for under $5-$10 as the stoy can last 10 hours.

Good game. One of the best space games. The combat is a bit too fast though.,1

"If you're looking for a solid multiplayer beat-em-up tug-of-war game, Awesomenauts lives up to the name. With an arsenal of amazingly balanced yet incredibly diverse characters, you can easily throw 20+ hours unlocking all the upgrades and fighting online or offline. Even though there are only a few levels and CPU bots (in offline mode) don't pick all available characters (it gets monotonous), every match is adrenaline-pumped and incredibly fun. You'll know you're doing well when your character's theme song is thundering over the stage music.",1

"When to by this game? Think of it as medieval total war as a combined RPG/RTS that you can switch to on the fly. And if you've seen the well-rated movie 'the messenger' with Milla Jovovich (thats right, the resident evil chick) as Joan of Arc, you will definitely encounter many similarities and even in-game scenarios that happened in the movie too.   On normal mode, the game is very easy to play. It's a typical old-school hack-n-slash revolving around using your left and right mouse buttons for combo's, and Q for blocking. Jumping and pressing C can be used for other powerful attacks. What makes the game enjoyable is the historically correct story (to my knowledge). Downside is the not optimally working collisions at times or some NPC's getting stuck (or even yourself, because NPC blocks path).  The castles and encampments in this game look great and you can decide to destroy them in RTS mode. The walls, towers and gates can actually break and be destroyed. Or you can decide to take it up close and personal and breach our way in and kill all the soldiers inside.   There's a few classes of troops to choose from from light infantry and crossbowmen to polemen and macemen. you can assign all of those to your controllable commanders (the main characters, same as historic equivalents) or to the occasionally appearing less significant NPC commanders which look the same as regular units except they're donning goldplated armour. The configurations stays both in RTS as in RPG mode.  In the first few missions the RTS element isn't introduced yet which doesn't really matter as you will not have a lot of units under your command thus playing in RPG mode makes sense. Later on in the game, you'll be able to build more troops, buy more armor, weapons and food and even build siege weapons.  Despite all the positive goodness, here a list of things that may downgrade the gaming experience: - the poor collision registrations when striking enemies who are down. Instead, just use a power attack, you'll hit anyone down and standing. problem solved! - getting stuck. it's annoying when your fellow soldiers get stuck especially if thereby they block your path. the only place it happens a lot is at Tourelles. if you go up into that fortress to destro the arbalests, make sure you have not too many units following you. or it will be impossible to go back via the narrow stairs and you can't jump off the wall. - food shortage. There is only so much food in the game. You have a special inventory for yourself and the main characters, and a separate inventory for troops following those characters. with 15 troops under your commmand, it's doable. If you've got like 50 of them and they're under fire from siege weapons and arrows, food disappears within a minute. The only ways of getting more food is slaying enemies, slashing crates or buying from the food store, and the food store's food is NOT infinite. ...  - The drag and drop interface. you can only move 1 item at a time. This becomes very problematic if youre in the heat of a battle and have to pause the game, to remove food items one by one to your troops inventory, to keep them alive -.-. Takes away from the gaming experience.   But yet, a game truly unique in its design with a nice story (you might learn something.) and oh yeah, checkout that movie joan of arc: the messenger with milla jovovich, you will recognize a LOT from that movie in this game.",1
"grab an enemy, slash and stab them with a freaky combo, smash them into the ground, and boom.. you got SSS for being handsome :D  but too many cutscene here, and the game seems monotone and kinda boring until, at least, dante showed up and being playable..  everything is going crazy here... grab the game fast, hold your breathe, and play your very own style of slashing demons and toads(?).. you can fight a toad as a boss and grab his tongue 10/10",1
"I'm re-writing my review for this game from scratch, because my feelings have changed quite a bit over time.  When I first got this game, I was using an X-Box 360 controller. I was used to more arcadey driving games (like Flatout), so at first it was a real shock to drive Corsa with a controller. It took a lot of getting used to; the steering was so sensitive that I found myself just barely moving the stick. It was tough, but satisfying once I got the hang of it. It takes patience to get good at it.  Assetto Corsa is a wonderful hotlap simulator. My playtime is 99% doing hotlaps. I've never done an online race, and only a little bit of the career mode. I play in Eyefinity, which is spectacular with a driving game. I later got Project Cars when it came out, but the steering with a controller wasn't as satisfying, and I couldn't really run it smoothly in Eyefinity, so I stuck with Corsa. I upgraded to an X-Box One controller, and eyed the X-Box Elite controller jealously.  Then one day, a friend gave me a cheap MadCatz wheel. It was a revelation! Take it from me, even the cheapest wheel is better than the best controller for this kind of game. I loaded up all my driving games to test them out, but Corsa was still the winner. If anything, I felt that way even more strongly. Project Cars just didn't feel right, and Grid Autosport is just sad next to the others.  But on this last Black Friday, I treated myself to a Thrustmaster T150 force feedback wheel, and everything has changed. First off, holy god, force feedback is worth the money if you like driving games! But suddenly, Project Cars was the clear winner among my racing games. Dramatically so.  Sorry, this review is getting longer than I wanted. The bottom line is, Assetto Corsa is a great game for hotlaps. It's the best racing game if you use anything less than a force feedback racing wheel. It has many cars that Project Cars does not, like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche. It's got road cars like the Shelby Cobra and the Mazda MX-5. It doesn't have as many tracks as Project Cars, but the tracks are very well done.  But ever since I bought that force feedback wheel, I find myself playing nothing but driving games, yet I go a week or more between sessions in Assetto Corsa. I think the handling is as good as Project Cars, but the force feedback is not, and for me, it turns out that makes a big difference. Also, Project Cars looks noticeably better, if you have a decent rig to run it. But I find myself compelled to keep both games on my hard drive, mostly because of the better car list in Assetto Corsa.",1
"It is amazing,I mean yeah at first it is very difficult but take your time on watching videos to teach you so it doesn`t take you 7 years to learn how to like pull up a map and move the joints of models,It took me 3 monthes to learn how to move joints but i learned and i can now make decent pictures but the downside is i can`t take them,I mean i know the controls i just can`t put on steam but eh who cares anyways,This is just for fun to do whatever after so long knowing and working on this,But for 11 yr olds who just got off because Source Filmmaker didn`t hold their hand through it,There is something called YouTube and i believe it has videos on there to teach you,To assist you,USE IT",1
"i felt that, this port is.....really bad on the graphical side  however, the story was pretty cool even though the linearity of it all was jarring for me,  the leveling system gives you all the illusion of freedom with all the 'you cant have this yet' of a level gating system, consequently...you will usually build tons of points(CP) and not be able to use them at all  i liked what they were trying to do but good lord is it wonky  if you are a graphics purist or a person who LOVES perfect ports, avoid it like the plague however: if you can look past its odd flaws, then hit it up :)  ",1

Since then, I have waited to find a faithful successor to the original game. After having played this version of Gauntlet, I can honestly say that I found it. This game is as addictive as the original. You get that kind of rush when your life is almost depleeted and you are looking for a little bit of food. Great game, I highly recommend it!",1

"I started to play it and loved it for a while, but as the game progressed, it lost it's touch. THERE WAS NO POINT! And when they had a big update, I lost everything (think of the most top end gear you could EVER find). Yes there are challenges, and yes there are clans BUT FOR WHAT!?!? There really isn't much you can do besides loot, bring boxes to people, and capture different regions (sounds more like gang wars to me). It is alot like dayz (or tries to be) where it has no point. But at least dayz has decent gun fights, player interactions, and they are building it to where you have something to go for. Another thing is how the 'nether' are so friken OP. They do so much damgage, are fast, call their friends, and teleport! It makes it so hard to get from one place to the next. Also the safezones are camped to often. I know that they tried to fix this with an invincibility counter but it can still be gaurded by bandits. I would only reccomend this to someone who just likes to wander in games.",-1

"I played a few times, can't remember how long ago lol. The ide in itself is interesting and its what got me to try it out. I didn't like the fact that I was timed to make my desicions, that alone made me dislike it. The real issue, at that time anyways, if you 'trhow your wallet at your screen every minute' you get what your suppose to in game, if you don't, you wont get access to anything really... I am up for elvels and skills and such, but balance doesn't mean sameness but rather ' for every strike there is a block/counter and vise-versa'. This game does'nt or didn't have that. It much how other reviews state it, just buy your way in and break the entire gameplay. That pretty much sums it up but then again, if your interested check how its changes now.",-1

"Core gameplay is great. If you can get in a solid lobby you'll have a good time. It's tense, the perks give mostly meaningful powers, and it really is fun. Too bad you'll never get in a solid lobby. A quarter of the games I matchmake into give me and my friends a neverending loading screen, forcing me to quit the game to continue. The next quarter of games are so laggy that I literlly can't do anything. The rubberbanding so great that I can't move, and I can't do the quicktime events. The next quarter of games are full of toxic or bm players who will camp all game then talk ♥♥♥♥ at the end. Only the final quarter is games that are even remotely okay. Few of those games are good, and the desire to get into those really good matches is the only reason I even launch this piece of junk anymore.

"What to say, what to say... I was estatic to be able to play Bioshock once again and for awhile it was great. Once I hit the Smuggler's hideout though, it started to change. Among the most frequent: - The game kept crashing repeatedly. Annoying yes, but I was able to get around it by saving more often. - Textures kept going from high to smeared on then back again.  The biggest issue for me though is once I reached Arcadia. The game, for whatever reason, does not register saves anymore (even ones that you manually do.) I tested this three times and it was the same story: last save was 'Smuggler's Hideout.' I almost flipped my desk over with rage; I had lost two hours of progress due to this!   Don't get me wrong, Bioshock is one of the best series out there but this is UNACCEPTABLE. I say wait until this gets addressed and fixed.

Although it is a 1 trick pony and offers mainly sniping action it is very well simulated sniping action and getting in the perfect long range shot on a high difficulty level is very satisfying.

The multiplayer is also a lot of fun if you can get a good group of players together... very tense.",1

"Just want to say all these people saying the game won't run on their computers, are just expecting a brand new game to be able to be played on any graphics card with all settings at max, when in reality you need to find out what your GPU can handle. Turn down shadows a bit, draw distance, and maybe some of the AA(or instead of AA do textures, but I would rather do AA personally). The one thing I think is okay to attack the game on is, that it doesn't support SLI, but in reality, not many games do.    The game itself is amazing, I really wish the way you switched between the two characters was different, because it felt really cheap to start over as the other, and have everything play out exactly the same. I ended up liking emily much better than Corvo in this game. He seems so lame when the camera is on him so much, when in the first game he seemed much more mysterious and bold(If you disagree or know why I'm seeing it this way, please leave a comment.).   Been playing the game on the hardest difficulty and I have to say, it is much much better than the first game's difficulty. I love how if I am in sight of someone, even if I'm a bit far away, they will see me, unlike the first game. Making noise matters a little more too, if I start walking upright they will hear me, same as dropping something on the ground.   The beginning of the game seemed way too cheap and rushed, I know not many people like being stuck in cinematic story mode, just walking around listening to people for 10 minutes, but in my opinion, in the first game, the beginning really set the tone for the story.  I run everything on max except shadows and draw distance.  CPU: i5 4690K Watercooled OC@ 4.8GHz GPU: R9 290 Watercooled OC @ CC: 1125 MC: 1450 RAM: Kingston HyperX 1866Mhz 8Gb",1

"I have fond memories of playing Metal Slug 1 &amp; 2 in the arcades via those old school Neo Geo arcade cabinets and I was looking forward to playing this game on my PC. As it stands now the game is simply not playable at all due to various bugs. The most frequent one that I encounter is that the game is not responding properly to either my keyboard (Logitech G15) or my controller (XBox 360). For a game that's purported to have full controller support it does poorly even with a keyboard since it seems to be stuck going back and forth not allowing the character to advance. I'm not the only person that's purchased this game that has this (and other) issues, take a look at the Steam forum for this game and you will see plenty of complaints. I would not recommend purchasing this game unless there's substantial patching done which at this point doesn't look hopeful.",-1

This is game has replayabilty just like its predecessor and it will suck you in. I should mention Doom the classic collection are the only set of FPS I have ever cared for. I have never loved the call of duty but this has actually made me like these kind of games and apprecaite them. I have always loved games similar to skyrim but this has changed my view. Doom  is one of those games that just changes everything. It was the first FPS to grab everyones attention and you can see that even today. Most people probably want to know does this stand up as a good game these days and I can safely say that it is and Master levels for Doom is basically Doom 3. So instead of getting Infinte Warfare or The new Doom get this because this has ten times the replayability of any Call Of Duty game to date. If you are a fan of FPS games or just games in general get this game. It has something modern FPS' don't have, fun.",1
"Very Decent software you get here,was looking for an good game capture/streaming software for an acceptable price finaly i have found some thing great,which offers you some nice feature. Its an very resource friendly software,the impact while playing and recording or streaming is so minimalistic just AMAZING !(even with lower hardwer) Like the desktop capture mode very useful if you not only capture gameplay´s. Playclaws overlay look´s professional and clear to work with.you can blacklist software from windows which don´t will appear wihle capturing or streaming. Some last word´s about Playclaw 5,regular Updates + some little bonus for every steam nerd it has achievement. so its definitly worth every penny,i highly can recomend this great software,if you looking or even if you not happy with  the capture software you using at this time.  Greets Yücel    Ps: the only con i have seen so far is that playclaw 5 player status playing playclaw 5 doesn´t works  so that makes the achievement useless,but don´t bothers me much because the core software is importand and its working very well for me,so just some little note ^^ but im sure it will be fixed in the next updates.",1
"KF2 is a CO-OP wave based zombie shooter that is unique in a variety of ways, I didn't play the first game much but I definitely enjoy the 2nd installment. For a zombie shooter game the developers really did a great work polishing the game ever since early access especially, with the motion capturing of reload animations, the fluidity of Zed(zombies) movements and how well the game is optimized, the gameplay is smooth and I crashed only once ever since I started. It's definitely by far 1 of the best co-op shooters out there right now. Players who enjoys playing CO-OP games, appreciates teamwork/teamplay and loves a challenge should purchase the game no doubt.   However,  I have to highlight 2 main points .  First, the game has a really steep learning curve  if you are looking to play in higher difficulties. Obviously as a new player you do not have the knowledge/skills required to tackle higher difficulties since the difficulty system is unlike any others I have seen and is unforgiving to new players. For example, some basic things like leave scrakes to the large zed handlers, as a firebug you are not supposed to flame a large zed, yada yada, I could go on forever.  The point is, you have to be prepared to put in time and effort to learn to be decent at the game.   2nd, Suicidal difficulty is where everything starts to become challenging and fun. When I introduced this game to my friend, due to him being &lt; 15, I always played hard mode with him and as someone who loves a challenge, hard mode is too little for him and he stopped playing until I told him to try Suicidal. He's first reply to me when he played was, 'I think I'm liking this.'   I also wrote a beginner's guide a few weeks ago that contains essential tips for new players and if you are interested you can check it out.   Pros  + Really strong emphasis in teamwork and teamplay + Different perks/classes for you to choose and master + Unique Difficulty System (higher difficulties alter zeds movements it's not just a simple health increase) + Zed Time slow motion system is neat + Challenging and fun in the hardest difficulty with a good team + Steam Workshop Access has tons of community made maps to try out and play   Cons  - Pub Cancer games as usual and the trolls - Not so fun if no friends to play with - Hosting server is a chore - Limited Dedicated Servers.",1
They worked hard no tihns game its true but my god the dlc left and right with more to cmoe 15 bucks a pop 5 bucks for blood man...160 bucks to get the full game. the 60 dollars is worth it but you will be let down on the updates as there are dlc for the most part.,-1

"not like the two original F.E.A.R. games, this takes a more action packed approach to the entire story, dont expect the usual scary stuff like alma vaporizing enemies or the eerie atmosphere, while it is valid that htis game shouldn't have a F.E.A.R. title, its still a decnt FPS, the story while short is pretty dang good and the combat system is pretty solid. would give it a 7/10.",1

"It is somehow the little brother of Dungeon Keeper (which I loved very much back then). So I'm happy that I found this game which is quite similar and runs on modern machines (which my copy of DK doesn't :( ).   I'm recently playing on 'normal' and it is at times quite challenging. That's O.K. to make you learn which skills are most important to develop. Controls are a bit confusing at first, but you get used to it (e.g. for teleporting you have to slightly tap the right mouse button, when you press it, you get the character/squad menu).  For me, there is no reason to not recommend it. If you are not sure - get it on sale or via humble bundle (like I did).  I'm only playing single player, so I can't say anything about multiplayer (yet).",1

"TL;WR  Setting - Cybertron = Decent, Earth/Bay = Bad Characters - Cybertron = What you've come to expect, Earth/Bay = Meh to Bad Gameplay - A light expansion to 'Fall of Cybertron' with more wave based ordeals in campaign Story - Cybertron = (Enjoyable) Exposition, Earth/Bay = Stupid Online - No campaign co-op, No PVP multiplayer, Escalation significantly altered from previous games  Verdict: If you love the Cybertron series and can handle an obvious port wait for a sale and then pick this up, otherwise give this game a pass.  The next title in the 'Transformers Cybertron' line of games, this time with the added inclusion of Bayformers and made under a new studio. If those two new prospects don't sound very appealing ... it's because it's not. This new 'Cybertron' is easily the weakest in the series with a host of flaws and not much new stuff added.  The games campaign starts off by immediately putting a sour taste in your mouth by starting you off on Earth in the Bayformers universe. The environments on Earth are absolutely horrendous and can leave you asking if the entire game will look this bad, and the answer is only about 30% of it, which is the portion of the game you play in the Bayformers Universe. However if you manage to muscle through the first level you are then transported back to the familiar venues of Cybertron where you will remain until near the end of the game. The Cybertron levels are about on par with previous titles and all the characters retain their looks, voices, and personalities.  Gameplay wise this game plays almost exactly like 'Fall of Cybertron' so if you've come to love the gameplay of this series then there's no worries on that front. Unfortunately not much new stuff is added to spice up the gameplay. The upgrade system from 'FoC' returns with the exact same weapon upgrades, along with TECH, H.A.C.K, and abilities and characters for multiplayer being unlocked through crates that you get by leveling up and completing challenges. These crates vary in level and randomly give out everything mentioned above, so get ready to pull your hair out everytime you open a crate wanting an upgrade to your Riot Cannon and instead get 2 Jetfires, a multiplayer ability you already have, and a bunch of H.A.C.K's.  Story wise this game is a bit of a mess. As I said before the game starts out on Earth in the Bayformers Universe where you play as the new transformer 'Drift' who is a samurai robot who hates using guns over his superior folded steel katana's (which he only uses in his new unique ability) and constantly talks about 'honor'. For the first level Drift will go through an empty, desolate, and all around ugly city fighting off Cybertronian mercenaries working under 'Lockdown' who looks less like a transformer and more like a 15-20 ft tall terminator. In the end Lockdown retrieves the titular 'Dark Spark' and causes Bay Optimus to flashback to the Cybertron series to describe what the Dark Spark is and how it came to Earth. (And don't worry the Cybertron Universe is still a completely separate from the Bay universe.)  The Cybertron portion of the game takes place a bit before 'Fall of Cybertron' and as I said before, exists to exposit about the Dark Spark. Still the Cybertron portion of the game is enjoyable with a few of the old veterans returning to be playable. Still a couple of notable characters aren't playable in the campaign at all such as Starscream and Megatron. Very few new characters are introduced in this segment save for a trio of insecticons, one of which is playable in the campaign, and the rest are playable in Escalation.  After around 9 or 10 chapters on Cybertron you're thrust back into the Bayformers Universe for the finale. The environments in the new jungle area are better compared to the city, and the devs must've thought that too since you spend a couple of chapters in this same level. Afterwards you go to an even worse looking city that's completely devoid of color save for grey and brown, where you get to continue to play as Bay Grimlock. This Grimlock isn't very fun to play, with most of his melee attacks lacking weight and you constantly having to use his unique ability to get more health as you get continuously gunned down from all sides. Anyway the games final chapter has you play as Bay Optimus and face off againt the Dark Spark powered Lockdown where he reveals (SPOILER) his evil plan is to make more money in a universe where I didn't even know transformers had money.  Lastly the Online has been changed and a bit butchered compared to the last game. There is no competitive PVP, no campaign co-op (like 'FoC), and Escalation has been radically altered from previous titles. In this new variant you enter Escalation with a player setup such as character, ability, and weapons and devote all your credits to building and upkeeping base defenses instead of using them to unlock new areas, and weapons. The difficulty has also been significantly toned down and now almost lacks a challenge.",-1
"This game is like nothing else out there. It leaves you transfixed by the beauty of the visuals while keeping you there for the short but powerful journey, with the most atmospheric music of any game. 10/10",1
"One of my favorite games and highly recommend if you are a teamwork freak (im not, but still fun)",1
"Terrible.  Nice art style, and the music is plesant enough - but it sucks all kinds of donkey pods when it comes to actually playing.  'Puppet Style' animation that is just janky and rubbish, poor hit response, laggy controls, unskippable cut scenes, floaty unengaging combat - the list goes on. It fails on every level as a videogame but not in a 'oh my gosh that's so terrible its funny' kind of way - it is crushingly mediocre; a half baked unloved mess.

"Other than apparently needing a windows live account, thus providing no Steam acheivements, and the absolute need for a controller, Dark Souls is arguably one of the best games ever created. It's wonderful mixture of simple yet complex combat mechanics and challenging yet far from impossible gameplay makes for countless hours of incredible experience and ridiculous replayabliity value. The game's story is incredibly complex, and VERY rarely outright told to you, as the player. Rather than doing so, it shows the story through its locations, items, and enemies, so the player can become as invested into the game's enriched story as he/she wants. This is truly, without a doubt, the best game I have ever played. ...other than it's 4 direction rolling. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ after playing DkS2 and 3.",1

"Okay so I guess you are one of those clever players who is here checking for traps before you purchase right? Good for you! There is a lot of hate aimed at this game. I have only one personal neg: the first five minutes were not enjoyable, that being the tutorial dream sequence of the campaign with silly blurry effects whilst I was trying to find my feet. But then that nightmare ended, and all became coherent. The campaign is a little trite, but then the campaign is not the strong point of this game.  One of the main complaints aimed at this product is that it isn't true to D&amp;D, nor can it compare to the tilset power of NWN. The thing is, if you want to play a game faithful to D&amp;D, rules and all, just go play D&amp;D. We already have D&amp;D. Five editions of it, seriously: use Roll 20 or invite your mates over and have a game at the table. That's as D&amp;D faithful as you're going to get! Want NWN with better graphics, fine, this isn't it, but this isn't a cheese burger either, and all the cheese burger lovers aren't on the forums ranting like drunk harpies.   Having said that, let's move on to the positives. If you like D&amp;D, and you enjoy the Forgotten Realms setting, and you like a good dungeon crawl or narrative with a distinct D&amp;D flavour, you will likley enjoy this game for what it is: D&amp;D tropes with some lightweight dungeon design tools.   The free weekend gave me a chance to try this game for myself after reviews disuaded me from purchase prior to now; I now own the game. I particularly enjoy the elegant dungeon crawl generator, where one may stack level after random level and drop their character into the gloom. Looking forward to more content for this game as I currently explore the Module design tools - lightweight but fun and accessable thus far like the previously mentioned random dungeon crawls. Sword Coast Legends is fun and accessable and worth a look. Going by the forums, you've got a 50% chance of being charmed and a 50% chance of turning into a drunk harpy. Roll it.",1
If you've already played DMC4 then you know what you're getting into. No new areas or that many new scenes BUT A great new cast of playable characters.

Terran Republic with speed and rate of fire (with large clips, though with lower damage), New Conglomerate with their harder hitting, higher recoil weapons.

" Meet 'Joe Black'   He's a bit of a gambler and enjoys a good curry. His hobbies include horse riding and gambling, he also boasts an impressive collection of hourglasses. Anthony Hopkins has met him (although he looked a lot like Brad Pitt back then). Bill and Ted have met him too. Seasons don't fear him (nor do the wind, the sun or the rain). I am of course talking about the Grim Reaper. The personification of death who also has a secret passion for cart racing (who knew!) which brings us on to Coffin Dodgers, an interesting little cart racing game bought to us by Milky Tea Studios.    The Scooter Plan   It seems that the old-timers of Sunny Pines retirement home have attracted the attention of our black clad bony friend and are not too keen on being 'reaped'. Knowing that Death is partial to a little cart racing some of the more spritely residents of Sunny Pines put their heads together and come up with a cunning plan. They will challenge Death to series of mobility scooter races to the... err... death.  The Grim Reaper agrees and the pensioners set about dusting off their 'Old Mans Harleys' in preparation for the races to come.  This is where you come in. You'll get to pick your favourite OAP from a selection of seven wrinkly racers, grab your controller (or keyboard if you want to punish yourself) and race your chosen oldie around the suburbs of what can only be described as a bizarre little town.    Close Encounters   You'll be racing around suburban roads, zipping through tunnels whilst dodging oncoming trains and tearing around graveyards in an effort not to come last, If you lose, the Reaper will take your sole and it's 'game over man'.  There are various obstacles and distractions to slow you down too, a good example is when you're roaring around the farmland outside of Sunny Pines where you'll quickly discover that several UFO's have also taken an interest in the area. These little spaceships, which I suspect may be storing their alien cocoons in the local swimming baths, (That would explain the sprightliness of the Sunny Pines residents... seriously, you haven't seen the movie Cocoon?)  Anyway these little spaceships will try to slow your mobility scooter down with their tractor beams, this is a bad thing when you've got a pack of equally desperate 'coffin dodgers' snapping at your heels.    Granny Grenades   As you race around the various tracks you'll also collect power-ups which play as much a part of winning the race as your driving skills. A handily timed shield will protect you from that machine gun toting granny who's desperately trying to get passed you, like wise a missile power up will help you blow that problematic pensioner out the running if you can get her in your sights.  Why there are rocket launchers, machine guns and 'shields from the future' lying around on the road isn't explained, maybe the aliens put them there? Why are there aliens? Because they're visiting to collect their cocoons from the swimming pool, remember!  Don't look too hard for any coherent logic or meaningful plot here, this is a true old school arcade cart racer, you don't need fancy reasons, you just need fast reflexes.    Pimp my Ride   Should you finish in a respectable position, you'll be spared the scythe a little longer (unlike the poor old sap who came last) and live to race another day.  You'll also have earned yourself some experience which you can spend on upgrading your trusty mobility scooter. From go faster stripes to an engine that will actually make you go faster, there are several upgrades to choose from which should give you an edge in the next race against Death.    Mutton dressed as Lamb   This genre has been around for a very long time and I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to review a cart racing game without mentioning Mario Cart which came out way back in 1992 and opened up the flood gates for countless cart clones.  The genre hasn't really moved on much since then either, sure the games have gotten better looking with time but the actual mechanics have pretty much stayed the same.  Coffin Dodgers is a testament to this, the cutesy cartoon graphics whizzing past are pleasant enough. The audio again is fine, although the music can start to grate a little after you've been listening to it for a while.  With regards to game play it feels very similar to countless other cart racers I've played in the past. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I enjoyed those old 'cart'em-ups' and I enjoyed this one too. It just suffers a little from a feeling of déjà vu.    Codger Comedy   There are two aspects of this game that did shine through for me though.  Firstly, the premise.  Whilst I'm sure some out there will be offended by the term 'Coffin Dodgers' and wear their moral outrage with pride against this mobility scooter madness, I found the whole concept hilarious. I mean, pimping up mobility scooters, racing grandads, Death riding in a cart, it's comedy gold! It also adds an extra level of tension, if you...

"This game combines military shooting with pointed satire, and mindbanging. I highly recommend it, especially while it's on sale. To be frank, I don't think I could ask for a game to be more tailor made to my interests, so I have bit of a bias here. But seriously, If you're going to buy one military shooter this year/christmas/sale, buy this one.",1
Amazing. Only thing thats missing is Endless challenge :(,1
"The game is beautiful. Unlike other survival games, this one does help you during the start on how to play the game but only enough to then let you througoughly explore and learn the game on your own. It is pretty random though on the displacement of items you can find, or the enemies you might cross, for instance finding a wolf at your first stop, that is just brutal. But the game is great and the soundtrack is amazing. I highly recommend the game!",1
"A fantastic game. Fast paced multiplayer. I have both sworn blind and giggled like a schoolgirl at this game. There are aspect to the game I would change but no game is perfect. War Isn't pretty! The range of weapon diversity and playing style is impressive. Also there are free updates, maps and features being added regurlarly! I only wish I could have more time to play this game!",1
A wonderful remake of the original. Loved the original. This is a great update to the franchise. Hope there will be a Space Rangers 3.,1
"Dear Esther is not for everybody. If it was a movie, it would Oscar bait. It's beautifully shot/framed and has great sound editing and mixing. It is not a summer blockbuster AAA type title. Dear Esther is best consumed while in some state of inebriation to add to the experience. The story is haunting and unique, giving it excellent replayability.   Yes, it is a 'walking simulator,' and you should know this going into it. However, that is not a negative if you know what you are getting yourself into. If an artistic, atmospheric, story driven walking simulator with a top tier soundtrack doesn't sound appealing to you, don't buy it. If it does, you will not be disappointed.",1
why the ♥♥♥♥ cant i play with windows ten,1
"Played this as a kid a long time ago, bought it and played it now still as good as it was back then 10/10 u wont be dissapointed!",1
"This game is first of all amazing! There are few downsides and even those are completely tollerable. This is easily the best single-player expierence as far as gameplay goes that i have ever had. The story takes a while to get you intrested. Because of this, the gameplay almost takes away from the story. By the time the story gets good, You're too sucked into the gameplay. So if you're wanting a great story, go play Last Of Us, but if you're looking for a good story and some amzing gameplay then buy this game. The combat is bassically Arkham style with swords and killing people. kind of like the Assassins Creed Style of combat with hit streaks. Okay lets get to the great stuff...THE FREAKING NEMISIS SYSTEM! If you don't know what this is, go look it up. It's works so well and adds so much to the emmersion factor. Also, I'v only playing the game through once, but I feel as though i could have taken a whole other rout with the game. Stealth, Combat, Ranged. This game is great. The only negitives are these:   1.When you're are sprinting, You can't climb/Jump over Large Rocks. Small rocks do fine, but after you see this guy climeb a 300 foot tower, you feel as though he should be able to climb a 15 foot boulder.  2. gameplay is so good it detracts from the Story.  All in all, Amzing game. 9.7/10 ",1
"This game is fun, thought it was a clicker at first, well pretty much is with a twist. 8/10.",1
"Not as intuitive or easy to use as game maker 8, but leaves itself alot more open for more experienced users. I reccomend this if you want to move on from gamemaker 8 and find something more stable to work on 9/10",1
"Personally, I enjoyed AC2 way more than Brotherhood. I think that Brotherhood was good, but some of the missions felt tacted on to remind you of the new features added on to the series. I think the story progressed nicely, but I felt some of the side missions were too much. Capturing the towers and paying to open up the stores had me hesitant to stay away from those areas until I needed them. Overall the game was good, but not great like AC2 for me.",1
"4/10  Weaponary isnt that good Health is TOO low 'Trust me' Only online , no campaign but the tutorial There are other much better FPS-Shooters , So don't waste time on this.",-1
"Awesome game, awesome port. ASW did a fantastic job.  Graphics look great, gameplay flows like water. No framerate drops on my rig. Good-sized roster and unique characters. Challenge mode is excellent for learning the ins and outs of a character from the fundamentals to the fancy stuff. The Story mode is perfect to watch while you kick back and chill.  My first impression of the online community is that it's friendly and more than happy to help others learn the game. Right now, the netcode has some problems, but it's passable for now. That's my only gripe.   I was excited to get this game on PC ever since I heard a rumor about it. My wish has been granted, and it was granted well beyond my expectations. Solid buy!",1
"This game runs great, and looks great. There is modding support for singleplayer although multiplayer servers are tied to rockstars service. I highly recommend this game as there is just so much to do in it, you will almost never get bored.",1
"The game itself has a interesting way of gameplay, It takes away something you've had for a very long time, The camera feed. This game is going to scare you one way or another, All you have to protect yourself is a flashlight, The game's jumpscares will surprise you, The only way to beat the game is to listen, That forces the player to use his volume and not cower out and turn it off. Five Nights at Freddy's took a big turn and you never know what will happen, You have to make choices in this game unlike the others, You can close the door, Or use the light, And it makes the game hard because if they are far away and you use the door they come closer, However if you use the flashlight and they are too close then you will die, This game has taken horror to a huge new level of terrifying, You can check the closet, bed, or doors, If you look behind you to stop Freddy then an animatronic can be in your room, If you go to the closet or doors then Freddy can be summoned. The Five Nights at Freddy's backstory was the most creepy, The main mystery in this game is to find out which animatronic bit off some person's frontal lobe in 1987 This entire game series has been horror, jumpscares, minigames, Freddy noses, And alot of fun, I would suggest this game if you are brave enough to wander into a room full of horror, You were once able to watch a live camera feed but now you have to walk and get closer to the robot itself, Welcome to Five Nights at Freddy's 4",1
This is an awesome game in VR! For only five bucks?! Buy this if you own a Vive!!,1
Pretty good metroidvania game. Worth a playthough. Has a decent difficulty too.,1
2/10 Pretty good -IGN,1
"This game is worth getting, many hours of fun. Great party system so you can play with your friends. There is also the competitive element just to prove how good you have got.",1
this game is so amazing and inventive. I know it looks bad but you just have to trust me because i cant really say why is good without spoiling it.,1
"I am into  idlers  so I tried this game even though I did not like the title nor the way the UI looks on the screenshots.  And now here I am, still playing, longer than other idlers actually. I even find myself reading the lore of the game, which is absolutely not professionally written, but so entertaining, like a casual conversation with a friend reporting his crazy  acid  trip last night about fighting puny gods who talk to asteroids to get their stone (yes, that is real).  So yes, if you are already here, give this game a try. It is definitely going to pull you in.",1
"This game doesnt get the credit it deserves Pros fun dynamic gameplay lots of replayability for different play types unique powers and feel like they belong beautiful enviroments   cons could run better, but just scale down the shaders, it will run at 60 fps and i dont have a beastly pc'  a lot of the reviews of how the game doesnt run well are pre patch, and those reviews are killing this game.",1
"A game that confused, shocked and made me feel like garbage. A game with a brilliant story that is sadly mixed in with absolutely boring gameplay. If you're gonna play this, play it for the story.",1
Meh .... I xpected more :3 but is kinda fun tho......,1
Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win. Pay to win... Oh did I mention that its free to play?,-1
"Pay2win, imbalanced characters, worst community ( pinoy players), and economy sucks.",-1
"This is a awesome game, but I would say its a perfect Australia simulator I do say. Lets see, everyone has the Aussie accent, they whole land you drive in is just sand, you have fist fights over cans of dog food and much much more. +Pros: -Instant controller support (pc controls suck) -Open and vast wasteland to explore -The customization of your own car (Aka the Magnum Opus) -Nicely developed characters such as the lovable Chumbucket  -Max has the voice of a god -Just like some, its good that it keeps track of each area and tells you how much loot is left (For the completionist inside you) -CONS: -The starting PC controls are pretty bad -The driving and combat takes some time to get used to (shooting and stuff) -Its not as hard as I thought, I thought supplies such as gas and water would be more scarce like in the movies -Some of the actions such as filling up you car with gas is hard as if you are not in the right place and press the button, you could light your gas on fire (Happeend to me on more than once) -The saving system is messed up, from what I know (Please correct me if I'm wrong) The only ways I learned you could save is just autosaves when you go from area to area, making it a pain to just get off without losing progress CONCLUDING OVERVIEW: Its a really fun game and it does make you feel like you are in the Mad Max movies fighting for gas and dog food. It has lots of hours packed into it and I do reconmend it to fans and non-fans of the Mad Max movies.  9/10-Needs more DLC, IGN",1
"How one of the Devs said this game was an apology for the bomb that was the 360's Shadowrun... Oh the irony! The Tactical Combat is only a very poor knock-off of XCOM, with vastly over-powered abilities countered by those that become worthless within the first few combats. The skill system is lackluster at best, and includes arbitrary and useless designs, going against the spirit of Shadowrun. Personalization is a joke, and the story lacks any form of depth. And for a game calling itself Shadowrun, the combat is very lacking in brutality (although there is plenty of BS), it fails to provide alternates to that combat, which the PnP books have always made a point the real Shadowrunners look for. Frankly, I'v had far more fun with FASA's Shadowrun. To make it more dissapointing, this apparently got the SAME Metacritic score. SAD. Oh, and I've been hearing that some kickstarter backers haven't gotten any of their exclusive content, for shame.",-1
"Hey everyone, here's my review of Alan Wake!          YouTube™ Video:  Alan Wake - MC Gaming Review&nbsp;",1
Best zombie movie Best story zombie game. Both movie and game is the best in the world FANTASTIC STORY!! I need The Walking Dead: Season 3 RIGHT NOW!!!,1
You need to make the game faster with better fps,1
Been waiting for this game forever and it was worth it.,1
76%,1
Looks amazing. Sometimes when I figure out a puzzle my brain feels weird. I like it a lot.,1
10/10 Would blow up Kerbals again.,1
"Good game, very good for wasting you're time; pretty adictive :)",1
Stuck?  You need more Poise. YOU NEED MORE POISE.  GIT POISE. GIT GUD.,1
The best In the series...so far.,1
Great strategy game to play with friends!,1
"A rather incredible game, with one of the most interesting 'game worlds' out there.",1
This game is about tentacles and doesn't need porn to be great,1
Best game ive ever played highly recommend to friends GOTY,1
Best fantasy roleplaying game of all time. Up there with Fallout 2 in replay value.,1
" 5/10  The campaign was absurdly short, easy and repeptitive, however the storyline was okay, but very rushed. The aiming and point of view are very difficult to manage at times and the combat doesn't feel very fluent. If you are looking for a scary, exciting, thrilling game I suggest F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R 2, sadly I couldn't recommend this game as it's more of just a 'laugh trip' most of the game I was just laughing at how insanely dumb the game is.",-1
"Very good game, the story is really good and graphics still hold up.",1
"I remember waiting for my best friend to finish the campaign,so we could play zombies.The campaign was amazing and it still is ,and i played the more modern games such as BO1,2-COD AW.The zombies are good,multiplayer is cool.I say it was worth $20 or 10,like i got.",1
"A new audio voiceover? now i get that that is something, but as close to nothing as you can get.",1
" In a nutshell:  For every one thing this game does right, it messes up in another area. Recommended for the more challenging HOGs, difficult puzzles, unique collectibles, and goofy FMV acting if you like that kind of thing. Not recommended for the blah story, slow-as-hell pacing, far too much backtracking, and the many bugs that require fussing around and even deleting files just to get past unresponsive puzzles or locations.  If you're the impatient type or don't like overly brain-taxing games, this may not be the best HOPA choice for you.  *pulls hair and screams silently* Alright then, here we go.   Story + FMV + VOs",-1
"Really a great game, but i've never really seen a game that's systems were too complex for me, until now of course.  The skill system seems to be very well done, however, the overwhelming complexity of it, and the fact that most of them are passive stat bonuses besides being an interesting ability or an interesting passive, really deterred me from playing it for extended periods of time.  That leads me to say that I would reccomend this game, its just not necessarily my cup of tea, but it may be yours.",1
The best!,1
"The Witcher 3 is easily by far one of my top five favorite games of all time. After experiencing everything the main storyline had to offer and doing witcher contracts, roaming the realm and just taking in the sheer beauty of this game, I can't stress enough what a damn solid job CD Projekt Red did with this game. Would easily recommend this game to anyone who fancies open world games.",1
"This review is based on Zoom v12 which was released earlier on June 2016.  Pros: 1. Extended customization functions. This is more aimed for power user, so people who want to just play their media might not find any of it useful. Required documentation before tweaking things, though. Online and offline helps are available fortunately.   2. Interface is clean and easy to use once YOU are familiar with it. It takes a bit learning curve, however.  3. Internal install center so it's easy to keep components updated. You don't need to download things outside the program e.g decoders.  4. Although it's packed with features, the software overall is pretty efficient, I'm trying to compare this directly with MPC and playing same file, it has quite comparable CPU and RAM usage (1080p file, 2.5 hours long movie). Both are using around 15% CPU (of my i5 5200u) and 160 MB RAM (of my 8 GB on Windows 10 x64). Program start up is instantaneous as well on my old SATA drive.  5. DRM free. It wasn't, but it is now when Developer realized it's only upsetting Steam customers for a product like this.   6. Continually updated. This player has undergone some major revisions over years and Steam users are getting those updates for free.   Cons: 1. Expensive. Unlike other freeware like FLV and/or Media Player Classic, this doesn't come cheap.... or free. If you're aiming to get it and think the features or 'pros' I listed above is enough for you, by all means get this software. But for me, this entry barrier (pricing) is enough to hold me off if I still didn't have the software. For information, I got this from Groupees bundles  (www.groupees.com)  so there's a chance that this will be bundled again in the future. Or well, Steam might offer discount during major sales, so keep an eye.  2. No internal subtitle search function. Media Player Classic has it, and I love that feature. It often saves me time from searching through Google myself. This Zoom, sadly, doesn't have it. Hopefully they'll add it in the future.  3. As an audio player, leave this alone. When it's compared head to head against the likes of Foobar, it's not even a fair match. Foobar has much more functions e.g multi playlist that a modern audio player needs and we really don't need fancy video player features JUST for playing audio files.  Overall, if you want more than a basic functionality (but it works) of freeware video players out there, you can try this one. Otherwise, you can stick with what you're using.",1
This game is a action combat open world game and has quite a good story and lots to do. Mind you the boss fights and special challenges are pretty easy and after the story it allows you to do everything so you can 100% like me and have no life for a week or so. It also comes with all the DLC and if spent 13 hours and only completed 33%. The only bad thing I have about it is that the controlls are meant for consol and you get stuck on allot of things and attack the wrong enemy alot. 9/10.,1
Good sheit,1
Recommended!,1
"For once, I'm glad the game is in open beta rather than a finished product, because that means they can still fix/tweak things.  Pros:  1) It's all about the bullets, baby. No grenades or throwing knives flung from halfway accross the map. 2) Pay 2 Unlock. The weapons some people pay to unlock, you can obtain by playing the game without making it Pay 2 Win. My first match, I found myself killing other people, even people several levels above myself. 3) Level objectives flow freely from one to the next, making for a very nice, fast-paced combat experience.  Cons:  1) Game delay. Once you join a server, it's 15 seconds until you can deploy. Between games, it's 30-45 seconds, leading to a lot of players leaving the match. I'm not complaining about having to wait for the respawn to happen - Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory did that, and it worked quite well; but not enough players ready up to make the stupid countdown timer go away. 2) Load delay. Every time you complete a level, the game goes into profile synch. I can understand the need to make sure everything is sympatico, but couldn't that be done between matches, when the players aren't doing anything? 3) Server depopulation. Due to the above-mentioned delays, I've seen servers lose most of the population because they're going to find games that are actually being played, rather than waiting.  Short version: the game can be summed up in one word: potential. As long as they make it easier/faster to get into games without having to hop servers every other match, and they avoid wrecking the game in later patches, then Dirty Bomb could easily be the next TF2-based game (because they're apparently never going to release TF3)",1
this game is dank,1
"If this game can out when I was a child, I would not understand the concept, but because I am older, I can apreciate how much work into this. Not many games make me cry, but this one did without even trying. I did watch every last spoiler before playing this game, and still, I had the time of my life.  Word of advice, if you are going to play it, to get the best out of the experience, do not see any spoilers",1
"Even if you don't like football, you will like this game, devs bring everytime new content in the game, it's fun, you can play hours and hours ! The game is cheap just go =), just know that you need to play with a controller, forget the keyboard + mouse configuration ofc.",1
ERMERGERD Takes forever to level up but is an epic adventure (theres blood BTW) Ive played it forever and ITS AWESOME  ,1
Excellent adventure game!  Has a great and engrossing story beautifully told and rendered.  Outside of a few minor technical oddities (which didn't hurt gameplay) and the occasional WTF?! puzzle (the bane of all adventure games) this game is now in my top 5 adventure games of all time.,1
"This is probably one of my favorite games now. Seriously. Not just 'Puzzle platformer' games, one of my favorite games overall. It's rare (and kind of sad) that so few games nowadays actually make you  think  when you're playing it --not just 'how do I solve this puzzle', but broader questions about conscience, existence, and what it means to be alive.  The Talos Principle begins with you, a robotic being, waking up from slumber to the welcome of a god-like voice. It belongs to 'the creator', a being named Elohim, who claims to have created the world around you as a garden. Your purpose, he explains, is to solve puzzles and collect his sigils, which will allow you to become immortal. His only covenant is that you do not climb the Tower, which he says will lead to disaster and your inevitable death.  Yes, this is a very puzzle-centric game, but despite how difficult some of the puzzles can be, they're all genuinely fun. This game is just brimming with secrets, and some hilarious easter eggs, which kept me searching the game for hours longer than I'd expected. I'd say it's probably got 15 to 20 hours of solid content, maybe longer if you're determined not to use a guide when you're stuck.  I can't emphasize this enough: if you want a game that makes you think, and has a chilling yet beautiful story, buy this game. We all need more games like this.",1
yes gud gaim i laik play this,1
just like the good old days good game play . runs smooth  sadly last update cant be instaled . disk error . while i dont have disk,1
Everything about this game is amazing couldn't ask for a better doom 10/10,1
One of the best games i have played,1
"only played a bit so far, But as with the last game in this franchise, I love the post apocalyptic setting",1
"I gladly spent my 39.99 for this game and cant wait for Chapter 2 now. It was a very pleasant adventure in Daventry. I loved the characters and the voice actors did great. The puzzles are not mind boggling but they do make you think some and the art work is great. I did find a few animations that needed some work, but overall they were good. Truly a great adventure game here :-)",1
"Litlle quirky game. Try not to die as you manage your kingdom, explorer caves and what else the game throws your way. Rather reminiscent of a phone game in the gameplay.  At the pricepoint I imagine most will feel it is money well spent.",1
This is much more then you'll expect. Great value for money if you like to just run around doing pointless things.,1
"Refer to my review for XIII Century. It's like Total War, but without campaign management - just battles.  If you want something surprisingly enjoyable (and in some cases without the lag), then give it a try.",1
"The metascore is a farce and reflects the current videogame market and preferences. This game does so much to promote skillfull teambased gameplay, from pace to learning curve. Levels are well thought of and tightly balanced.   In-Game currency is actually not to grindy, you can get the 50K needed to unlock a new merc in a couple of days if you play the various missions (meta-game), and rare (basically paid) drops offer NO GAMEPLAY advantage over fairly common drops. This is NOT even slightly PAY 2 WIN (Yet).  It's free, download and have fun. I do recommand buying the starter set to get the essential mercs and a bit of cash.",1
"The poor reviews are all based on one janky stealth mission mid-game. The boss fights and backdrops are nothing short of incredible.. and being Dracula feels amazing.  I do agree with one reviewer who said that he hoped you'd be powerful enough by the end of the game to take out those giant stealth dudes like it hints at.. but nope. :(  The castle, the music, and the gameplay are all executed perfectly and it's obviously the developers care about the source material.  Play this if you loved the first game or you're missing out.",1
Was a great game but like all old games the hackers have taken over and not fun anymore.,-1
"The voice acting was pretty lame and there was a few bugs during the release, but nothing too major. The gameplay was interesting with all of the secerts and multiple routes available. It gives the player a lot to explore. The soundtrack was really good. It fit really well with all of the settings, whether it was in a creepy building or in a dull and run-down plant. I am really looking forward to the free content the developers are going to release for current owners.   All-in-all the game is good and I highly reccomend it to anyone that loves puzzle games!",1
"Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys making their own humour! Challenging, but simple enough to not feel guilty if you decide to 'mercy kill' the patient. Surprisingly quite a bit of replay value and plenty of situations to choose from. Even more now that the anniversary DLC has been released.  Best feature of the game: the guy basically has the dexterity of a club  Have fun and remember, if it looks fine, he'll probably live. :P",1
"Nice game, shame it's still full of cheaters .... and VAC does not do anything about their",-1
i guess its a good game .I played it for few hours.,1
"Very enjoyable casual RPG styled game. Spent the whole weekend playing it and was not disappointed. The ending was a bit faster than I expected just in the way it happens. It makes me think there is good sequel potential for this game.  Worth the 10$ If there was more story, I'd still be playing it. Definitely a grinder game. I would compare it to a SNES looking version of playing a Sims game with the empasis on fighting.",1
Hitman Absolution? More like Shitman Crapsolution. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible worst hitman game so far. Its casualised as ♥♥♥♥ aimed for cod audience feels more like splinter cell combined with big rigs than Hitman game. There is so many things about this game wrong like disguises which are fokin useless cuz everybody recognize you anyway (you can sometimes avoid detection by tipping your fedora or staring at donut which makes your enemies lose all suspicions about you). There is also god afwul instinct system or some ♥♥♥♥ that give you free wallhack and ability to read enemy minds so you can fokin see where enemies will go and when they are going to take a ♥♥♥♥ so you can kill them while they are doing it. You can also 360 noscope multiple enemies at same time without any effort using ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mark and execute system ripped straight from Splinter Cell Conviction. Also the enemies are even more dumb than in previous games. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible Hitman became moralfag and he is trying to protect some dumb teenage ♥♥♥♥♥ from evil people because he promised it to his ♥♥♥♥♥ Diana   which he killed in first mission but in the end it turns out he didn't kill her after all so yeah ♥♥♥♥ it  . Last thing worth mentioning about this gaym is score system which makes you lose points when you decide to kill people instead of knocking them out. tl;dr don't waste ur hard earned money on this crap. If u want real Hitman game get fokin Blood Money.  3/10,-1
its a racing a game with great tracks and vehicle. great hadnlign and phyics and fantastic sounds.,1
"I've never been a gta fan, but I loved this game. Awesome soundtrack, decent story, and fun gameplay, 10/10 would buy",1
"Bioshock is one of those rare games that you can pick up and not want to put down, even after playing for hours on end. 10/10",1
"With a simple yet captivating art style and a magnificently written script, Firewatch is truley one of the better examples of a 'Walking Simulator' to date.",1
"It's a Great Game, I Recommend it, worths its price, great quality graphics and gameplay /physics, I really dont udnerstand why so much hate and negative reviews from others. One negative is that there's not much people playing online and if you are higher level sometimes you can be get kicked often from other hosts which makes you most times go back to single player/carrier mode.  A good way is to find other skilled players to you level and send a friend request to have someone to play with. ",1
Brilliant Game. You dont need a great pc to run it (which is good for me) and character creation is really funny,1
"This is by far the best version of GTA V I have ever played. Smooth, beautiful, intense, 60 FPS. Me and three of my brothers got this game (pc guys), and never have we had so much fun playing a game. Its got car chaces, full on wars happening in the streets, random ♥♥♥♥ exploding, its dead fun! I highly recommend this to anyone who has a heart and brain. If this game doesn't sound fun to you, then god save you because you're possesed by some demon if you don't like it.",1
Awesome game spent so many hours just love it! Has plenty of mods for different game style!,1
"A really intense game unlike others. Massive multiplayer battles. Various character, vehicle and artillery customization features to your liking. Three Empires: -The Terran Republic (the conservative, authoritative nation aiming to reunite the clashing factions) -The New Conglomerate (a liberated faction fighting to remaining free) -The Vanu Sovereignty (technophiles seeking to develop and exploit alien technology) If you are looking for a FPS-MMO then PlanetSide 2 is one.",1
"Cannot start. Uplay crashes when launching, every single time.",-1
It's too short to really consider it anything but a glimpse of what could've been a good game with a more detailed character study.,-1
This is a fun and simple Tower Defense + RPG game!,1
50 - 50 for this game .. idea is simple and fun to enjoy .. but controls r annoying .. u have to keep the cursor behind the ship to push it .. not point where it should go ! ..  recommending it yes .. but if u get it on sale !,1
"Canabalt is a silent and modest game jam giant that was in the first wave of titles which drew attention to the emerging indie scene at the time. It was a groundbreaking game that popularized a subgenre of endless runner games, such as Race the Sun and BIT.TRIP Runner series in certain aspects. But does it still stand the test of time as a true classic?  Story wise, you are the Runner, an athlete who is running over the rooftops and is trying to avoid hitting any obstacle while there is an enigmatic, ongoing invasion happening. The story is minimal and its kept in the background, while the gameplay takes priority. Speaking of the gameplay, Canabalt shines in evoking rush of exhilaration through simple and tight controls: you only use one button in the game to jump. You can make light or high jumps depending on the force with which you push the button. There are various obstacles on tracks that are procedurally generated, which will cause the player more or less trouble, and sometimes will even help depending on the height of the jump and speed the player is running. Canabalt is a very fast game, where the speed of the protagonists progressively accelerates to ludicrous levels. Besides the endless main track, there are several modes of plays, each one focusing on one style of play and obstacle.  Visual presentation is still very good, with a minimalist and monochromatic graphics and a great attention to the details and animation that make Canabalt look vivid and evocative. There is only one, good music track that follows your ventures through the rooftops, and the sound is also minimalistic, but impactful.  But there are minuses in the game: there are many animation bugs that will pop up when you are reaching the maximum speed, that one music track is good but will get repetitive fast and procedurally generated course tracks aren’t as varied and interesting as they ought to be, and create that same-y feel in the long run, which is the game’s biggest letdown.  This was made by one man, and it is a stark achievement to be sure, but I can’t help but feel a little bit of indifferent to Canabalt. In the first hour of playing I was ecstatic and mesmerized, but the game shows all its tricks in less than 2 hours. After that, all that remains is the repetition and a ghost chase of getting back that feeling of being intoxicated with this game. Canabalt is a good game for the price developer is asking that simply runs out of fuel and magic tricks fairly quickly, a flawed classic.",1

"Once in a while the game industry shows us that there is still space for gentle and poetic narratives, that gaming isnt all about blood, explosions and violence: it is, of course, a field that requires fantasy - real life is often dull, so, playing any sort of video game is, in a way, a retreat from this world to a more vivid and interesting one.  Still, this game tells the tale of a youngster, dealing with growing up, ostracism, loneliness, facing dreams about what life could be and the terrible fear of the ever dream-crushing reality. We've been there. Some of us are still dealing with it. Some will never leave this painfull stage of life. But Maxine can rewind time and, by doing so, she can change the course of her own history and that of those around her. Learning to say the right thing in the right time, and gaining infinite opportunities to try and try again and to go on, not only knowing that she did the best she could, but knowing at least the immediate the results of the choice she chose not to make. That bit of fantasy is what defines the strangeness in 'Life is Strange'. without it, the title would be, perhaps, just real every-day dull life.",1

"Only good thoughts come to mind when talking of this game. The story is brilliant, the platforming is crisp, and the adventure is one you don't run by as much anymore (never with SEGA). Even though this is a lustrous port of Sonic Adventure 2, I still have some complaints. Not very many times does this occur, but lag is present in multiple stages along the way. The controls are the main flaw, as they suck completely. In the games launch window though you can change the controls to best suit you, which was a good move by SEGA. Complaints of the gameplay are the Knuckles and Rouge levels, are they are frustrating and hard, not in a Zelda way though, as they are not enjoyable. Overall, this game is beautiful. It highlights the good old days of SEGA during the Dreamcast. 8/10",1
This is one of the best games of the Dreamcast generation and it plays amazing and looks amazing well worth 60$ a steal at 10,1
"After they buffed the swat van enemy in this game, I realised something. You cannot beat it unless you pay for a DLC weapon that is able to deal explosive or high amounts of damage. Same goes for captain winters, you are never going to kill him unless you have some sort of explosive weapon or a flamethrower. (All DLC weapons btw).  Now new players might not get what I'm saying, I will make it simple for you. They expect you to have DLCs for the game from today onwards, if you just buy payday 2 by itself.... you're not going to get very far in the game. Microtransactions in a paid game, I don't need to explain any further. Everyone knows about the paid for drills and weapon skins that give stats.  So all I have to say is, are you sure you want to go down this route? Who knows what is coming next for this heavily broken game, plenty of bugs still exist yet overkill doesn't seem to care about them. Cops glitching into walls, cloakers going through walls, the list goes on. I can no longer recommend this game, buy all the dlcs you want to make yourself think it's a game worth your time. Don't be surprised if every game in the future becomes like this.  I really loved Payday The Heist, it had one DLC. Not much broken things about it, everything felt complete. I can't say the same for Payday 2.",-1

"Doom is a very awesome, bloody, fast paced, kill everything that moves and thrilling experience would definetly recommend this game for the single player experience but the multiplayer is lacking and very boring... but who the ♥♥♥♥ is buying this for the multiplayer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1
"So I got this game on sale a day or two ago and I made one fatal flaw in my decision. I believed my money to be going to buy a game in which I get to be an assassin killing some Red Coats.  In fact I was buying a movie in which I got to walk, not run, the main character from cinematic to cinematic. Any time I would try to deviate from the Ubisoft Guided Tour of 1776, it would just put up insivible walls keep me moving towards the next cinematic. No amount of detail and historically acurate architecture can keep me hooked when a game called ASSASSIN'S Creed would only let me kill 2 named characters in the first HOUR AND A HALF!  Other notes against this game: - No gamepad support, only keyboard controls. - Limited Graphics settings, no HD, no windowed mode.  If you love really long movies about random pseudo-accurate Ben Franklin and the Revolutionary War, this product if for you, If you are looking for an actual game that builds atmosphere and connection, this is not for you.  1/10",-1

"There is something to be said about a game that makes me question what kind of drugs the designers were taking during development. When someone figures out what that something is to say, tell me, so I can write a perfect recommendation for this game.  Zeno Clash is a curious mix of weird -wacky worlds, fun gameplay, and surprisingly high quality voice acting. It's short and sweet, and definitely doesn't outstay its welcome. Although creepy at times, the art direction is enthralling. There's a definite charm to the world of Zeno Clash and the strange language thats spread throughout, and its in the boundless creativity found within the minds of the Bordeu family.  Do yourself a favour and give this game a go. I'm going straight on with the sequel.",1

Is good time. Many fun.,1
This game is much better now then when it came out.,1
"Before I start, this is MY opinion of the game. Everyone has different opinions and views of this game and thats fine by me!  First off, I was not expecting to actually be able to play this game since I know my computer is not that good in specs and graphics and I just wanted to have it whenever I am able to update my computer. But I got lucky since I tried the game out anyway and was able to play it at around 20-25 fps, which I can personally deal with.   Singleplayer:   I really enjoyed the story mode a lot. Great fight scenes especially with the boss battles and quick times events. The only thing that I did not like was many of the cutscenes just have still images with voice overs compared to the awesome CGI ones. There is still some CGI cutscenes but compared to Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (which was all CGI), it left me disappointed.   Free Battle is off course what it sounds like, able to battle with any characters you want which is fun. The different combat moves and special moves are awesome to see, with many big explosions. Many different characters to choose from as well which are easy to pick up since they follow the same combat input combinations. There are also other modes such as survival which can keep you occupied.   In adventure mode, you can use Naruto (and if you have the DLC like me, use Shikamaru with Garra coming later) which allows you to explore the different locations such as Konoha while having a main quest to do along with fun side quests mixed in adding to more content.   Collection is there to see everything you have bought from the Bandi Store including pictures for your multiplayer card to new costumes from past games for your characters. It is a lot of content to buy and again would keep you busy to get all the content.  Multiplayer:  I do not play multiplayer since my game has slow fps. But if you do go into the multiplayer menu, there are special events that is only singleplayer which they update about every week that you can gain certain awards so that is pretty cool, especially for someone like me who is not really a big fan of multiplayer anyway.   All in all, I really enjoy this game and being a Naruto fan this is pretty sweet. Personally, I give it a 8.5/10.  ",1

"+Fun idea - unique and satisfying searching around sites and messages to find information +Personalities are unique and engaging +Liked enough that I'm eager for episode 3 +Felt like I could control people's futures (for a little while) :D +Brings to thought an interesting point about mass surveilance that is semi-relatable (people's blogs and such).  -Enjoyed ep 1, and by ep 2 I began to feel like I couldn't really make a mistake -EVERYTHING you need is highlighted. You could actually play this game by just flying through the highlighted portions and making (seemingly irrelevant) choices without context.  -Nearing the end of ep 2 I didn't read 'into' the surrounding stories and information nearly as much...it served little to no purpose and it drew out the time I spent in game without the possibility of benefit. -Made me realize how much I would despise any group of people who had this job in real life, spying on people (criminals or not!!).   TL:DR It's a unique story you get into. It's fun gameplay until you realize how the game holds your hand the entire way. But the story keeps you hooked anyways. Casual game.  6/10. Would be higher with a better 'sleuthing system' than the pre-highlighted vital info nonsense. Love the idea, just needed to be harder and more complex.",1

"One of the most under rated shooters out there!  How something like COD can get popular but original ideas like this get almost no credit I will never know, but that's besides the point, let's dive into my review, shall we?  So lets start with the pros first: -A fun take on combat, with humans pitted against different dinosaurs -For the most part, the combat is pretty balanced. Different characters counter different dinosaurs, and vice versa. I have yet to have encountered something OP so far (though the jackrabbits can be pretty annoying) -Almost all the characters/dinos are well thought out, with actual backstories and some with special abilities! -Different dinos and (I think) different humans have different health bars. With this, comes some cons though. The tankiest dino can only move into places more into the open, because he's too fat to squeeze through doorways. I feel this is a good way to balance things -Awesome comics to read if you're interested in the backstory! (as you can tell by the trailers, it's pretty well thought out!) -MUTE BUTTON! THANK YOU! -Lots of new people trying out the game, so we're all on equal playing ground. Not a lot of sweaty tryhards here!    And now.....To the cons: -Once you've played all the classes it gets a bit repetitive -The community isn't DEAD but it's starting to get there. Like I said, under rated games are...Under rated. -Basically almost always any gamemode besides TDM is dead... -Comics cost money on top of what you're paying for the game. It's only a buck but, come on! -The devs have sorta abandoned this game, we haven't had an update for a while other than the Last Stand DLC, WHICH ALSO COSTS MONEY. -Can be sorta overpriced when not on sale considering the ammount of people playing, so maybe get it only when it's 40% off or more. I got mine when it was 80% off for around a 2 dollars so make sure to do what I did!   So, in conclusion I think I have fun on this game much more than having a bad time on it. Like I've said before it is an extremely under rated game IMHO and I hope this review will help you in the decision of if you're going to buy it or not.  Have fun, -Monkey King ",1

It was obviously designed and written with the intentions of seeming like an X-Files or Twin Peaks episode.

"I've been playing this for quite a while, since literally a week after it was shown on the Steam store. I've been playing it every so often, and I can't help but find new levels of improvement. If the developers keep this up, I think this game would truly be considered an AAA game. This has a mix of absolutely everything. When you're raiding a place, it makes you very tense, almost like a horror game. It's also survival, and many other elements are mixed in. I have to say, this is one of the best games I've ever seen.    Then they added the ability to make your own story.   Then, I realized that eventually, AAA wouldn't be a good enough title for this game.",1

Definitely would recommend to anyone who doesn't already have it. I would suggest using a sourceport like Zandronum or GZDoom",1

"A technical masterpiece with few equals. Red Faction: Guerrilla accomplishes something very few games have ever tried, much less achieved with real success; dynamic destruction with full physics and few - if any - slowdowns accompanying them. While the game is not perfect and even its destruction system can be finicky at times, Guerrilla is a game that I wish had inspired other developers to follow suit.  The centerpiece of the experience is the Geo-Mod component of the game that handles dynamic building destruction. From my experience, little comes close to the level of optimization, stability, and overall fidelity that Geo-Mod enables for Red Faction. Practically every building in the game can be demolished in a maddening variety of ways. Strategically knock out primary supports and let the roof cave in, demolish a wall and watch the building topple sideways, or just ram a tank or a few demolitions charges in the front door and let the chaos unfold. Even with hundreds of individual pieces of a structure smashing to the ground and causing even more death or destruction in their descent, the game runs butter-smooth in all but the most catastrophic of collapses.  It isn't just Geo-Mod alone that makes the building destruction fantastic, but how the game is set up. From the beginning, Guerrilla understands that demolishing buildings is a core element of the game and incorporates it into everything from sandbox shootouts to evasion missions. Stuck in a corner with bad cover or no ammo? Whip out your sledgehammer and knock a hole in the wall that's got you trapped. Taking fire from a difficult target on a balcony? Chuck a demo charge onto the bottom and bring the floor out from underneath him. Horde of APCs charging over a bridge? Blast a hole in their path and watch them tear apart the bridge's supports on the way down.  Unfortunately, all games pay for quality in some area or another. Guerrilla suffers in several. While its shortcomings rarely fall below a professional grade of quality, Guerrilla struggles notably in its writing and offers a fairly light, two-dimensional plot with an antagonist that's almost on par with zombies in lack of characterization and absurdity. Characters on both sides of the firing line aren't developed beyond their basic introductions and the conclusion of the story itself is predictable, at best. The game's wonderful soundtrack almost feels like wasted potential as a result.  Combat, graphics, and post-story sandbox activities are smaller failings, but are thankfully not quite as mediocre as the game's story. Gunfighting suffers from enemies lacking satisfying hit feedback and a reliance on weight of numbers and spongy health instead of engaging or varied behavior. The player's arsenal likewise suffers from severe maximum ammunition limits, forcing many weapon switches or battlefield pick-ups to stay competitive. Interplay with the game's destructive environment, good player mobility, and a wealth of available weapons shore up the otherwise forgettable combat, but only enough to keep it from being a chore.  Graphically, the game isn't quite up to snuff, but this is understandable given its sandbox nature and physics-heavy environment. Textures are low resolution, models often lack in style or quality, and animations are mixed bag of stiff movement 'compensated' by high playback speed. Lighting is often strange inside buildings and the game's low texture resolution is regularly given its own 'compensation' with aggressive tiling where applicable. Fortunately, the Geo-Mod system is again of note; its effects, sounds, and behavior make for a stunning experience watching buildings collapse.  Overall, while not as well-rounded as it could have been, Guerrilla is an applaudable, enjoyable game that baffles me for all the right reasons; why has no one followed it up, copied it, or took after its lead with its sandbox destruction? Why does a 2009 game have better physics than many games that came much later afterwards? How the Hell does this thing run so smoothly? Finally, why haven't you bought this game yet?",1

"This review is based on the fact that I've only just bought this game (sale price £11) and as such I missed all the crazy bugs &amp; glitches debacle at launch.  Firstly the most noticable thing about this game is the new engine used, the game is bloody stunning compared to the previous itinerations. I have a fairly modest system comprising of an i5 2500k, 16 gb ram, GTX 780 and the game runs like butter on Ultra settings with FXAA. I've noticed very little problems in terms of any glitches so 'yay' for now!.  The game so far pretty much runs through like any other AC game, uncover the map, collect various stuff, gain money, improve / update outfit, gain new weapons, play various missions and most importantly kill stuff.  Do you like the other AC games? Do you feel like it's been a while since you obsessively searched every inch of a game's map searching for collectables? Do you like to stab guys with your hidden blade? If you answered yes to any of the above then get it bought.",1

"Blacklight: Retribution offers a very realistic experiance of shooting physics (in terms of video games :]) and a massive number of combinations for improving your weapons, all in an interesting, sci-fi world. It's good that a new player is not that overwhelmed by these high-level pros with shiny, sophisticated weaponry, and thus can do some damage with basic set of guns - your aim is the most important here. There is a number of items that you can use in the game, from differents types of grenades through decoys and shields to revival and healing injectors. You can indeed adjust your character to your style of playing.  This game is definitely worth giving a shot, but, of course, aim for the head. ;)",1
"Progress: Completed Tutorial Campaign. Made it to second scenario (Towards the Within) of the Necropolis campaign. Did not get stuck and give up, simply lost interest in playing.  A decent game marred by some major design issues. Scenarios are too long and the slightest missteps in the beginning (losing too many units, picking abilities poorly) can set you back hours or take you hours to get to a point when you realize you have to restart. The greatest downfall for me was the lackluster story. After 20 hours played my only engagement was a few lines of dialog. My interest eventually waned.",-1
"At the full price, no, I would not recommending buying this game.  First of all, it was a wonderful story. The narration between the two characters, including all the backstory that is revealed felt like reading a good book.  The game was everything I expected. It was very professionally done, no major glitches with a clean release. It was a nice adventure/story game.  The downer to me came when I completed the game in 3 hours. While I did not catch every easter egg, I did explore the whole map, all the boxes and took my time taking various routes on the map. The bottom line, for me, is $20 for 3 hours just isn't worth it to me. Had this game been priced at $5 or $10, I would have been more than happy with a positive review.  The worst part was that at the 3 hour point, it falls just outside the time limit for a steam refund. It is almost maddening to know that maybe if I hurried the story along quicker, I could have beaten the game in full AND recieved a steam refund!",-1

"Suns, spaceships and puzzles Oh MY!  Solar flux is a puzzle game in space. You control a space ship which has to re-feul/de-feul suns.  Gameplay is the main selling point here. There are 4 systems. Each system has a few levels for a total of over 70 levels across all four systems. Each level tasks you with either feuling suns or de-feuling them. In order to accomplish this, you need to collect plasma and then fire it at a nearby sun. Each sun shows a percentage of power it has (e.g. 20%) and each time you collect plasma you ship indicates how much plasma you have (e.g. 20%). You have limited shields and feul. Moveing your ship uses up feul, which when you run out means you die. Shields are delpleted by getting to close to suns and also results in death when you run out. You can refeul your ship at the luanch station, and you can regain shields by moving away from the suns. To further hinder you are asteroids, which when crashed into immediately kills you. The puzzle element come into play when you have to manage all these factors and try to re-feull the sun/s without over extending your resources. Each level will reward you stars based on how little resources you used to accomplish your goal (e.g. low feul use or shield damage etc).  There is limited audio in the game. No background music is played during levels. Sound effects sound good though.  A plot and voice acting are also absent from the game.  Movement relies highly on physics. To move your ship you need to click behind it (unless you change movement in options menu), which propells it in the direction that you pushed it. The more you push your ship, the faster it goes in that direction. At the same time, the more energy you used to push your ship, the more that is needed to stop it and change direction.  Graphics are decent. The suns as well as the background imgaes look good and detailed. the asteroids don't lookm as good, but they blend in well with the background. Your ship doesn't appear impressive.  If you love phsics based puzzles as well as space, this game will satify your cravings.",1

"This game has been great since i've been around and it's been a couple years. It's kinda repetitive at some point and that's why i have few hours on it (as i have long periods where i do other things).  Still, devs are doing a great job. They keep adding new stuff, interesting events and they keep expanding the lore. THIS is the reason i still love playing Warframe: the Lore. With every update you discover something about past events and main NPCs and it's lovely (especially after two years wondering who the fu** they are and why they are there).  Also, graphics are very good and they get updated every now and then (just saying: last big patch, albeit exceptional, was almost 7GB, most of which texture updates and other visual stuff), weapons come in every form and measure and there are TONS of options to upgrade them: most regular stuff can be dealt with by any weapon with the right build. More powerful weapons give broader options as they aren't required to stack damage mods to work as efficiently.  Still, there are weapons ranging from daggers to heavy twin-bladed axes to polearms to handheld motorized saws for melee. Oh and let's not forget boomerangs and similar weapons (did someone say chakram?). Ranged weapons are even more varied, from regular pistols to C4 thrower (look up for the Stug) to assault rifles to LMGs to rocket and grenade launchers to lascannons and almost every kind of ray weapon you can desire. There are some 200 different weapons (some are just variations of the same weapon -Prime weapons for example- but there is a lot of room to experiment and find the one just for you.  And Warframes are possibly cooler than that. I'll leave them up to you to discover (but you HAVE to know there is a freaking DRAGON frame).  There is one thing breaking the mood tho.  If you start playing alone, do NOT team up with someone with brains (and avoid going public unless you need it). While MP is recommended -and in fact mandatory for quite some stuff- i unfortunately find there is a huge weakpoint: - if you play with friends or with someone with some brain you can't go back to solo play, it's too boring - if you play in PUGs expert people will just run, wreck the place before you can aim your weapons and you won't get what happened or XP either. When you get to their level it's like going solo but with someone else on the map (since everyone minds his own affair defeating the whole purpose of going MP) and it's SUPER boring.  But if you can gather a regular group or you can keep your enthusiasm for discovery and a fast paced combat bolstered by explosions, great looking powers and incredible carnage then this is the game for you.",1
"If you... Hate Christmas, Hate Elves, love explosions, Love to clean stuff up, Love to make a complete mess, Love Blood and Gore... then this game is most certainly for you!",1
"I bought a license to walk, no I only need for running!",-1
"Borderlands 2 is a GREAT game. There's tons of stuff to do, tons of weapons to collect and with 6 classes (4 base game, 2 DLC) there's tons of replayabilty. This game is years old and I've bought it on 3 different systems and I still play it. Most of the DLC is great as well!",1
I really wanted this to work but just get the original.,-1
"it looks great, the story is hartwarming and slightley dark, combat is pritty fun as well as challenging and also 'hey red'",1
"Not the best game, Iv got this for 2.50 four pack with some friends.. Good game when its really really cheap but its okay. There are much better mmo's. Gives a message for any reviews",-1
Looks pretty but no real content. AI only tactic is continous waves of ships until you die.,-1
"Half of the hours I have on record for this game are from showing it to other people because I can't recommend it enough.   Undertale creates in you a sense of instant nostalgia and attachment to everything in the game. It does this by tying its spectacular music, art, characters, gameplay, and story impossibly tightly together. The result is one of the most emotional and enjoyable games I've ever experienced.  Play it.",1
"Overall I think this was a good effort, and I would recommend it, just at a price a tad lower than 6.99€. I experienced a few bugs, but none of them were game-breaking. For instance the physics system often has abrupt and 'violent' behaviour. Towards the end of the game my character also insisted on walking on his own in one particular direction (fix: pause + unpause). I think the game needed more polishing, for instance I think there is a distinct lack of environmental soundeffects. I.e. I can throw around rocks, boxes, ventilation grills and I never once heard a sound as a result. That really breaks the immersion. Astray is one of those games I think would have been better without an actual monster chasing after you and killing you. Those sections where you were more or less forced to interact with the monster felt not very frightening at first, and after that it just felt like a chore. I definitely preferred the first parts of the game, although I didn't care much for the demonology exhibit compared to the Egypt and Atlantis exhibits. I think the game after that needed more puzzles and the puzzles were generally too easy. For instance, I liked the idea of the puzzle in Atlantis where you had to equalize the pressure but I wish it had been made more challenging.",1
"Basically a decent enough flash game, easy to grasp, what depth/difficulty there is comes from fiddling with your population to get things as efficent as possible.  Unfortunately its let down by having just a single map and what should have been a nice, slow paced way to regularly waste a couple of hours on the train or whatever becomes something that you run through once and never touch again.  Bit of a shame frankly given how easy it would have been add custom/randomised maps but what's there is enjoyable enough.",1
"Forced to write a review - i've been playing these type of games for a long time and this is possibly the worst and most annoying variant ever Short review - pretty backgrounds, worst char select ever, gameplay astonsishingly bad + if you die back to the start and no escape until dialogue Sorry usually love this type of game it's not just dull - it's really badly designed and implemented - Avoid at all costs. Not only do I feel ripped off - slightly dirty as werll",-1
"  Only just started but already loving this game. Excellent writing, mature/polished combat, and great music/sound/voice acting. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed PoE, Planescape: Torment, or BG, and are looking for a game to scratch that itch.",1

"Now  this  is how you port a mobile game to PC! Full keyboard and mouse controls, comprehensive video options, no pay-to-win nonsense.  The PC version even got custom scenarios  before  the mobile version. It's so refreshing to see a mobile game developer that doesn't treat PC gamers like second-class citizens.",1
"Dragonfall... Well. Considering I didn't play the game before the release of the Director's Cut, I can't really speak for improvement.   However, this game is quite possible one of my favorites I have on steam. And I will detail why:  1. The narrative.  Holy ♥♥♥♥, the story starts off with a premise that drags your interest in and builds on it with interesting characters. Everything about the writing speaks quality. The choices given to your dialogue are diverse and plentiful, and you'll never find yourself feeling unsatisfied with the way it developes. But, I will say having some more climactic points where you really felt some character's lives were on the line, or the stress/pressure was eating at them would've been good. I wanted at least one heated argument or plot twist that really hit you hard.  9/10  2. The gameplay. I played on normal, and I still had a challenging time going through some missions. It wasn't impossible, but it definitely had the player requiring strategy to get the advantage in the combat scenarios and to be prepped for future engagements. Should I utilize my characters items now? What if there is more baddies? Who the **** should I bring on this mission? Everything must be questioned once you start getting into the story. Every firefight was engaging and had me on the edge of my seat (Which is rare for a turn-based to do)  I will say there could've been at least two more boss-type enemies in some missions to keep you on your toes.  Otherwise, very addicting. Every kill had my grinning like a psychopath as I yelled: 'YEAH F*** YOU, WHO'S NEXT?' Especially with the character Glory. Her melee kills are so satisfying.  8.5/10  3. Setting, length, graphics/audio and the conclusion.   The introduction of a cyberpunk-esque fantasy in Germany had me feeling outlandish. I had to nod and accept the culture and I slowly began to love the place where this was. It was perfect for that industrial-Sci-fi mix that works so well with the ongoing themes of corruption, mystery and adventure.   The length, although knowing it was going to be a stand-alone campaign had me wishing there was way more to the story. It hit the point where I was satisfied, but not amazed.   Graphics and audio... well, the soundtrack I felt was very suitable and a few times I found myself humming the tunes that started once battles began or we entered a location. The graphics have a great sense of detail to the artwork and the perspective it played at. Not Bastion-level, but still great!  7.5/10  Overall: 8.8/10  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE THAT LIKE: CYBERPUNK, RPG, STRATEGY, NARRATIVE-DRIVEN GAMES, ADVENTURE-GAMES.",1
it was good while it lasted,1
Oblivion with roaches,1
"Fun game...... for abit you play it thinking it has promise and you can get stronger, but nope its actually quite stupid! You go around survivng a little farther about every 15 attempts finding armour and weapons and runes, think this will help it really doesnt. I have 7 hours invested and all ranger armour and the bad guys at the beggining are still hurting me for 16-35 thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I started my armour was 10ish and yup same damage being done. Also you think your lvl means something it doesnt really, I am lvl 72 and lvl 16 doomtraits hurt me for 23 that is dumb! Also as you play the store keeps getting more and more expensive, everything goes up $10 when you upgrade something so there is a another thing to work around.......Ohhh ya and when you go to enter the castle a grim reaper guy named 'charron' (or something like that) takes all your money, unless you buy the upgrade where he takes %10 less. I do like this game to invest 7 hours into it but man I would like to feel like I am progressing but I really dont. Maybe I am just missing something who knows.",1
"Do you like being a jerk to every single NPC? Do you like fast cars? Do you like killing police officers? Do you like strip clubs? If you said yes to all of these, then buy this game now. Seriously, if you haven't already played this game in the 7 years it has been out, then play it. You are missing out on some serious fun.",1
"If you like survival and aren't afraid of magic, get this game. End of story.",1
"I found it to be a huge improvement on the first, which I already played to death. The gameplay is about the same, which I like, but the options for characters are different enough to be fresher. I'll miss my old S&amp;S Munitions guns, but I've found new love in Jakobs. The real benefit, though, is that the writing is consistently funny now, and I was laughing all the time instead of every hour or so. It's almost criminal how simpl and addicting it is. Shoot some guns, steal some more guns, switch them out, repeat. Seriously, this game just possesses me, and it's the closest I'll ever come to being a real life gun aficionado. Would totally buy again.",1
This Is A Really Good Game And I would Recommend it to anyone (Over 15 Years) c: ,1
"Bought for around a dollar. It's old as ♥♥♥♥. All that means nothing, still good game. kappa/10 better than AC Unity anyways.",1
I am definately pointing my nieces to this whent hey get old enough for games. This is a simple fun starter like Mario was for me.,1
Killing zombies? Is full time job now,1
This game is perfect for anyone wanting a dungeon-crawling fix! The graphics are gorgeous and colorful and the loot spews out of enemies like pinatas (same goes for the bloody gorey bits). The combat is satisfying and the controls are perfect. This is one of my personal favorite dungeon-crawlers of ALL TIME.,1
8 bit armies is a very adicting anf fun game with some interesting mechanics but when the game isn´t finished yet they are already selling dlc which should come with the basegame,1

"RECOMMENDED WITH A HUGE CAVEAT!  Everyone knows about the always online 'feature' (DRM) and how it sucks and the fact that it is episodic (I actually liked that). I'm going to focus here on the specifics of this game and why I recommend even though I'm starting to think Blood Money is still better.  PROS: - Very immersive. Graphics are amazingly detailed (it's a heavy game for your computer to lift, though. I have an i7 coupled with a GTX 1070 overclocked and I still get frame drops below 60 (rare).), NPCs chat with each other (sometimes giving you valuable information). As far as ambiance goes, games don't get any better than this. - Very varied and creative. You can complete missions in a myriad of different ways and it's so f*****g fun to try alternative methods. - Gameplay is solid and plays nice with a controller. I still prefer the freedom of Blood Money, though (more on that later). - Storyline does its job and scenes are well acted and well directed. - Even though it has less animations and mechanics than Blood Money, they work better.  CONS: - Limited compared to Blood Money (no rifle suitcase, can't throw every item, only a handful of traversing animations, still can't subdue people on staircases). - AI still behaves in ways that'll make you want to kick a baby in the face. - Loading times are immense (and I'm running an SSD).  TL;DR: Not a game for everyone, has its flaws, you should play it.",1

"I will get to this game eventually, but here is a review of DayZ: Essentially a Eastern European Wendyvainity style zombie game where the only weapon that is good is an axe that shoots magic bullets. Is only good in proximity to how many people are on the server. Otherwise, it gets boring quick.",1
Lot of gametime and time dieing was good,1
"I've put off writing a review for a long time, but today is a good day to finally write one. Think of where to start is hard, but i think the combat is as good a place. from the wide range of class on both sides many of the same guns will be in them, for example the ak-47, ak-74, m16, and m4a1, are found in almost all except for the sniper and recon classes. This isn't bad mind you because each are good gun, and the other guns in those classes are fun to play with as well, but clearly these are the guns that will be present on the battlefield the most. the suppression and damage mechanics make sense, usaully if you are pinned down with fire your screen becomes fuzzy, and if you are hut once or maybe twice, you are going to die. Recoil is realistic, aiming makes sense, and if you have a good reaction time you can hit what you shoot at. The community is what give this game such good memories in my mind though. When I first got picked up to play in this games upstart competitive tourny system I was a bit, how do I phrase it, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The more i played with my team mates, the better I became. By the time our team broke up due to disaggrements with the DGL I was still not great, but i had clearly become better. I made many friends who I still talk too, and game with regularly a year and a half later. People that play the game today are for the most part very chill and very rarely will you get some asshat that comes into a go and starts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off, which is nice to see. The dev team is also very cool, and if you ever get into a game with them you will figure out why I stated this. They bring fun updates every month or two, and manage to keep people interested in an amazing game.  So, I'd say if you are looking for a fun, cheap, team based game then insugency is the game for you.",1
Fantastic strategy game. Reminds me of a tabletop/card game hybrid. Art direction is consistent and engaging.,1
"i love this game. i played it a few years ago and it breaks my heart to see the reviews. the characters are awesome, theres some genuine fear of the guy thats chasing you. some of the puzzles ARE annoying and confusing, but this game has so much under hiding behind the cover. Most of the bad reviews in the game are from people who havent finished the game. This game is a gem, please try it. I highly reccomend, its free too.",1

"Learn to play tactic and strategic! ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆   Pros  - Good graphics - Nice music and sound effects - Huge number of units for both sides - Challenging strategic map at times   Cons  - Difficult gameplay not handful enough, especially with infantry and heavy artillery units - Lacks help and useful tips - Lacks flexible in-game pause - Tactical encounters too shorts (maximum length 20 mn)  This game could have been much better if some specific details had been mastered such as time left to player in order to manage its units once encounter has started. You often lack time and barely can't react because of too aggressive and quicker acting AI.",1

You might look at it and say, this looks like a ps2 game. Oh well, maybe it does but it goes to show simplicity is not a bad thing in a game. In fact it goes to show how awful western devs are because even with their quintillion dollar budgets they can't even compete mid budget japanese game about killing giant insects.

"It's a good game that requires a very good computer. Batman fans or not, you should love it. Many villains to fight. This game stays true to the serie. Fighting is awesome, but Kinda button mashing. But oh well it's still fun!  Overall: 8.5/10",1
"Wow, that opening song. The other bits of the soundtrack I've heard were good, but the opening song when you first gain control of your character is amazing. I positively love it. It's haunting, goes wonderfully with the atmosphere, and I can't stress how good it is. It's even better in the game than just listening to the soundtrack by itself. The sound quality of the wind blowing, wolves howling, and everything really makes the game deliciously atmospheric.  Beyond that, however, my love ended. You wander around until you find a tent. After that, you get a map, which operates just like in real life. That is, you can't tell where you are on it unless you see a landmark and orient yourself with it accordingly. Truth be told, I have a terrible sense of direction and found myself wandering down the wrong paths several times. Wandering through the snow with nothing happening got old for me after less than an hour, and the few times I did stumble across something, it was either your typical page of a journal you expect to see, or some so-so orange glowing aberration that is only of interest momentarily.  So from a sound/music perspective, this game is superb, but being lost and bored without gameplay other than walking around looking at a map, I just didn't want to keep playing.",-1
"I really liked alpha build, so was really looking forward to playing the final version. Although I didn't initially like the change of graphics much (I like big pixels, you know!), I gotta admit - this game got everything I expected it to have, and much more! It's so huge, and got so much content - totally worth the price. If you like rouge-likes mixed with puzzles, buy it! Let the goat-slaughter commence!",1
Not as expected but still a good game,1
"I've owned Braid for several years. I finally sat down and completed the game today, and it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disgrace that it took me so long. This game is fun. It's challenging. And it's absolutely beautiful - both visually, and narratively.",1
"This is an underrated game. Sure it's not Blood Money but it's still one of the better games in the series. The gameplay mechanics are streamlined and the game look great even on mid-settings.   Biggest addition to the game is the ability to slow time down to gun down your foes. You might feel like it's ripping off from Red Dead Redemption or Max Payne but it is really fun and I'm glad it's in the game.   The biggest complaint many people have about Absolution is that other characters in the game will immediately become suspicious of you when you wear the same uniform as them. This reduces the sandbox freedom to go anywhere like in blood money where you can hide often in plain sight. In this game you have to act more like Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell and sneak around.  Still, this is a solid game to pick up. It's one of a few games i bought on launch at full price and was happy about it.    ",1
Glory to ARSTOTZKA!!!,1
"This game is amazing. Brilliant, well thought out and beautiful. So much fun had in the game, almost sad to see the finish. There was one thing, right at the end that was a huge glitch, in my view, but I'm not going to spoil it for anyone else. The rest of the game totally made up for it.  Wondering what its like? Think Assassins creed meets zombies, and you'll be close. Well worth it, brilliant game.",1

Pretty unique genre-blending (rhythm game RPG) with cheeky humor.,1

"Best Free to play game. Still, in this game you have to 'pay to win'",1
"I cant really recommend this game since there is nothing really inovative about it.  Its a physic puzzle game (just like the million flash games and apps on the internet) with some flaws see below for detail.  Controls: Feel good and reponsive (the rewind function really reminded me of Braid)  Artstyle: Very nice altough it immadietly reminded me of 'Braid' Also some colors may have enhanced the experience, just having everything in black and white doesnt make a game more philsophical.  Music?: I dont know if it is a bug or not but I had no music at all (I had to play my own) which made this whole game much more bland.  Puzzles: Most of the puzzles are not that hard to crack (although I havent played all of them) mcuh more annoying were the 'timing puzzles' because you know how to solve a puzzle but you die because of bad timing thats just BS.  Conclusion: In the end its just another puzzle and I definitely wouldnt recommend this one because of the mayor flaws atleast imo. If you are looking for a very good and challenging puzzle you should get Braid.",-1

Take everything that made the original Ori and the Blind Forest one of the most beautiful and memorable platformers of the decade. Now remove the couple of things that were frustrating and add an entire new area to explore. I cannot recommend the game highly enough.,1
i recomend this game. it is fun to play.,1
"A fun and addicting game. Not a button-masher, as it will result in your death. Lots of levels to try to get a platinum medal and a perfect on each. Plus, the mindless brutality is always nice. mmmm, stick-figure death~",1
"Despite being a fairly exploitable sim, it's quite fun. Possibly because so, in fact. It's so easy to pick a single genre to stick to and be successful in. But there is depth to be had, and its telling the story of the video game industry (beginning in 1983 I believe) is fairly accurate and detailed while also summarized quite well. Not much is left out, even SEGA's downfall being protrayed (though they do miss the Saturn). I've put 20 to 30 hours in it playing through once without specializing in a genre, and am starting a second playthough to see just how well off I can finsih the game.  Tons of fun so far, and it's not getting old in the least.",1
VERY GOOD I CAN'T STOP PLAYNG,1
me and my friend played the beta HAD TONS OF FUN then jagex oh my god he really messed this game up   just dont buy waste of 15$ ,-1

One of my favourite games of all time. An excellent modding adventure as well.,1
"Some novel ideas, but ultimately boring and hollow.  I'm a big fan of City Building games, so I was quite happy when I first saw Banished. My first impressions once I played it were also quite positive, the game seemed really promising. But it got old way, way too quick. Once you get the basics of the game down (and that will take just a couple of hours for most people used to this genre, I believe), there's nothing else to do, nothing else to see. There's really no incentive to continue playing a game that is going well. There's no interesting buildings to look forward too, and expanding doesn't feel rewarding or fun - much to the contrary, it feels a big chore, since most of the 'work' is just waiting for your people to have children and for those children to grow up.   In fact, this pacing problem might be the biggest issue overall in this game: city builders aren't, by their nature, very active games. But Banished pushes it a bit too much. The game plays almost like a screen saver. You set up a few commands every once in a long while, and then just keep the game running at 10x speed waiting for something to happen.  If you feel interested in getting a City Builder game, I can't really recommend this one. Go check Tropico 4, The Settlers VII, Grand Ages: Rome, Anno 2070 or Anno 1701 instead; those I can recommend.  Update: if you do grab this game, I highly recommend the Colonial Charter mod.",-1

"PLEASE NOTE: The only game I have used this with so far has been Payday 2, I may update this review in the future if it brings large improvements to other games in my library. For now I'm going to safely assume it will.  Original Review: I dunno how it works, but Payday 2 actually has a stable framerate now, and that alone is worth the 20 bucks I paid for it originally  Edit: So after a week or so of use, I can't stand playing Payday 2 without it. Even with an i5-4690k @ 3.5Ghz (stock speed), a MSI GTX1080 Gaming X edition, and 2x8GB of HyperX FURY DDR3 1600MHz RAM there is a very noticable improvement in how Payday 2 runs.  My settings in Payday 2 are maxed out at 1080p with a frame limit set to 144fps, as well as vsync, depth of field, alienware light effects, and acceleration camera effect turned off due to personal preference. I used FRAPS to measure the average framerate over a 20 minute session both with and without CPUCores running.  Without CPUCores on a 20 minute long Panic Room at Overkill difficulty, I had an average framerate of 73fps, and I noticed significant dips in the framerate when transitioning between hipfire and ADS. There was massive amounts of screen tearing, as well as huge dips in framerate during explosions.  WITH CPUCores running, on the same heist and difficulty and roughly the same amount of time spent, I had an average framerate of 110fps, and noticed none of the issues above during gameplay.  That's a 50% improvement in average framerate just by running CPUCores, and not changing any settings within or outside of the game.  Your mileage may vary, but for the amount of money I paid for the program and the improvements it brought, it has been worth every penny to me.  Tl;dr, if you play Payday 2, and have issues with how the game runs, this is probably worth purchasing. Absolutely recommend.",1

"Good game for mindless exploding fun. It is kind of repetative, however, I think the mass amount of destruction more than makes up for it.",1
"The single player is fantastic. The game is beautiful, challenging, engaging, and hella fun. Daytime really feels like this urgent rush to find what you need and do what you need to do before nightfall. Nighttime, however, really puts players on edge. The Volatiles are fast, numerous, hit really hard, and can take a beating. There is a legitimate sense of 'Oh ♥♥♥♥ oh ♥♥♥♥ oh ♥♥♥♥' around every corner. The crafting is easy and the mods are plenty, as is the weapon selection and choice. While this may be fun and all, the multiplayer is quite a different story.   The multiplayer is, by far, the most one-sided game I have ever had the misfortune to play. If you want to get gold tier weapons, you have to reach rank 25 in the Survivor skill and play PvP for a CHANCE to get 'powerful' weapons. Here are the pros and cons of both the human(s) and Hunter(s).  Humans: Pros: -Guns -Explosives *That's it.*  Cons: -Only 10 lives amongst all human players in the match -UV flashlight does far too little, far too slowly -The UV flashlight can be disabled and it's, literally, the only way to stop a one-hit KO. Once you're grabbed, you're done  without it.  Hunters:  Pros: -Can infinitely grapple around the map -Has a one-hit kill move that doesn't have a cooldown -Launches bombs that disable the UV flashlight -Launches bombs that cause a mob of explosive Virals to chase the player(s)  -Can stun players who are using the UV flashlight even though the Hunter's power may be drained  -Total of 5 hives, each containing ~4 spawners that have an absurd amount of health and are heavily guarded by Virals  and Goons -Infinite lives -Decent amount of health -Regens health and stamina very quickly  Cons: -*Mildly* vulnerable when exposed to UV light for too long.  *Aaand that's it.*  Ways to balance the PvP: -Scale the instances around the number of human players in the match -Add human AI to help single human players -Make regular virals chase the human(s) rather than explosive ones -Lower the HP of the hives by half -Increase the number of human lives -Maybe add a dueling button mashing sequence when a human is grabbed by the Hunter -Give the Hunters a limited number of lives  Here's hoping that the DLC will give the multiplayer a much needed fix.",1
this game is good you spend like 20 dollars for over 500 zombie maps.,1

"game from 2003 feels like dumbed down half life 1 meets duke nukem.  story is fun, very basic but it gets the job done, cutscenes have dredd look like grumpy cat. very basic exploration leads to more ammo and health items. you can get 'lost' and wonder around for a bit because you havent fully completed an objective (aka 1 gangmember to arrest somewhere) a map or objective checklist would have been nice to have.  melee feels way to slow to be effective whilst all the enemies are in your face, this game is often as dark as doom 3 was, only you dont get a flashlight in this game. shotgun is only useful at close range but anything 'smarter' than a zombie is going to be a pain to get near and shoot fast enough with 1 shot every 4 seconds or so... if you walk into a new area enemies spawn left and right, see a corner you cant direcly see into? enemy...   pathfinding AI is downright terrible, both civis you have to save often get stuck on nothing or doorways only to get flagged with a waypoint. shooting them sorts that at cost of your 'judge rating' boo hoo. enemies both gangmembers and zombies can run around to the benny hill theme, cant look up if youre just 1 floor up and make for easy picking  the waypoints you get can be a PAIN to deal with, see that last enemy vampire thats jumping around you trying to claw you to death? yes lets give him a waypoint starting at his hips covering everything up. forget getting a headshot once the last enemy is 'waypointed' spray and pray  because its an old game it supports resolution up to 1600x1200  i got 3-4 hours of gameplay out of the single player and it has an online feature that i didnt checkout  giving credit where its due, the game does have a ton of funny jokes and wise cracks   you get to run around and shoot stuff and in that the game does it decently... bought it on sale and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun simple fps dipped in dredd sauce it was a budget game when it came out and it aged as such",1
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FROM ARKANE STUDIOS.  Familiar faces with a different setup.The strongest aspect in first game was gameplay and Dishonored 2 takes this gameplay aspect to whole another level.Story is linear but in a very good order.Its like story wtihin a story and this is an awesome thing for fans of the game.As a diehard Dishonored fan this game is better than the first and Game Of The Year for me. 10/10,1

"The description states 'experience what it's like to climb Everset' or something close to.   What you actually get is a series of 5 or 6 cut scenes.   The tutorial- and later crawling into a tent were the highlights. I didn't expect this to be a 'game', but come on, there was almost zero interactivity- which means no presence.   Take the 20 minutes it takes to 'play' this and watch a documentary about Everest instead, or read a map, or read a book about Everest, or read a map that tells you where to find a book about Everest. Just please don't support this cash grab.  ",-1

"I have mixed feelings about this one.  On the one hand, I believe this is a story that needs to be told, and retold. In the USA, when people hear 'Iranian revolution' they usually think 'Hostage crisis' if they know anything at all, but that's only the tiniest part of what happened. The complexities of the revolution and the government that emerged from it go way beyond that. The acting and animation conveys the setting quite well, and its clear how much attention to detail have been put into the historical elements of the game.   On the other hand, I rather feel that the game tells the story rather clumsily. In the first third of the game, I get the feeling that the characters are trying to hit a bunch of bullet points with their dialogue and don't quite manage to get a reasonable narrative out of it. Plus, the act of taking pictures and gathering stuff for the historical archive breaks up the flow of play - especially if you keep dropping out of the game to read what you've collected.   Overall, I think this 'game' functions more as an interactive historical lesson than a piece of entertainment. If that kinds of thing appeals to you, you will like 1979 Revolution.",1
Hack-and-slash games are my favorite so this game I would rate as one of my top games.,1
"If you're looking for a fun, aerial shooter you may want to pick up this game. Every weapon option is available from the beginning, so older players have no advantage over the newer ones, save for experience. The maps have a dirty, industrial aesthetic theme, and flying through them in first-person is a refreshing change of pace from the usual terrestrial shooter. Players can unlock custom spaceship parts and wing art to personalize their crafts, but these rewards do not grant any additional abilities or buffs.   If you want to fly around in a spaceship, blast away foes, or just want to play something different Strike Vector is for you.",1

"I've always had a soft spot for puzzle games. Portal, Braid, and Limbo hold a special place in my computer because I love figuring things out and creating solutions. Blocks That Matter though, does not completely measure up to these standards. It's a decent puzzle game but easily forgetable. I got it on sale for $3 I think and I actually played it twice and I'm sure I'll go back to it eventually but I'm in no rush. Did I get my money's worth? Yes. $3 could buy you a Bic-Mac, so would you rather have Blocks That Matter or a Bic-Mac? Provided you weren't starving, I'd say go with this game.",-1

"Wonderful game! Awesome 2D side-scrolling shooter platformer with a couple of simple puzzles thrown in for good measure. If you've played Cave Story, you'll like this. It's a decent 5-6 hours long if you go for completionists style. Definitely worth the $2 imo. The only problem I encountered was when I beat the final boss the first time, his eyes were all gone but he still had a bit of HP left. None of the weapons could finish him off. Played it again and had no issues destroying him to finish the game. Yay!  On the critique. - Most bosses were too easy(for me) because I used the Laser weapon - Laser weapon is OP vs most bosses(and pretty much everything)  Maybe give less ammo/different ammo with less reserve - The hitbox for the protagonist is larger than the character's body. Takes some getting use to but you can manage.  This is a fantastic game that is well worth the time and money. Plus, it makes it extra fun when the protagonist's name is the same as yours. :) 7/10 - Captain Cole",1

"  This is my story of Dota 2.    My brother gave me a copy of it when the game was paid, he had loads. I watched some tutorials, l found one with Pudge. I played as Pudge, for my first character. Then as Shadow Fiend. I kept playing untill l got bored, at early stage it was ok. I didn't play it for like a few months. Went back on and started playing. About 9 months later l went back on. The game was MUCH more diffirent then and l hope it will keep changing and expanding as it is now. Right now l keep playing it daily doing challenges etc.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So what is this game? and how dose it make it better than League of Legends?     This game is a MOBA. Well l get asked this question alot by my friends, is it better than LoL, Honestly l think yes it is, buy LoL is more comixy and diffierent gameplay. I played both of these games a fair amount and honestly l prefer Dota 2 than any other MOBA. But whats better about it? well, l would say its a bit harder than LoL (many people will not agree with me) and the gameplay is more free open, while LoL has a feeling of being squished, or sitting in a small room moving around. But Dota 2 is just a very unique game. You may not even play the game but collect items, what can l say, everything makes it better than LoL. Trading , finding items , etc. What l do like about LoL more is the creeps, in Dota 2 they look litterly like 'creeps'. But thats just because l like comixy more. Also, l recommend taking strectes after each game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So what do l do in this game?    Well long story short, It is a 5v5 game. You start of on a tutorial and after that you play in Match Making. There is diffirent modes in it such as All Pick , All Random , Ability Dwarft and more. l'll explain all three of them below.    All Pick       5v5 Each team picks any player from a BIG list of characters. Support, Nuker, Carry, ETC.       All Random       The name explains it all, 5v5 All random heros. You can repick to get another random one.       Ability Dwarft       This is recommended for experienced players. 5v5 random characters. Out of all the random characters all the abilites go in 3 squares and an line at the bottom. Each player gets 4 picks. You can pick 3 abilites and one Ultimate (your forth ability)     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    So, recommendation time.      Pros    Fun game, not too repetetive. Many OP characters. (e.g Ursa,Riki) Many annoying characters. (Disablers) Usally extreamly fun map. Recommended to play with friends.    Noobs    Fun, but hard. Repetetive. Alot of cool characters. Unknown abilites. ( I recommend using in-game guides due to many people not knowing what abilites to upgrade or what items to buy)   So as my rating for this game (finally) l think the dev's are good due to very good daily updates. And requested fixes.  I rate this game 9/10    Thanks for reading this if you did. it took me approx. 45minutes to write. I hope you decided on getting this game!   ",1
"It is a nice try to make such a classic in a modern design. I think that new players will feel same thrill we did playing original UFO. Those who did may feel a bit dissapointed. The game doesn't give such a freedom as the original. Many aspects are very simplefied. Still it can be a good try, as who would now have hours of free time to play ship missions of X-COM? Now the missions are much shorter and more dynamical. Tough choice wether to recommend it or not. I think you should go for it, but don't expect same fun as with the original :)",1
does not even work i bought this game for 50 fricking dollars and it does not even work i waited 4 months for the game and then bought it and then waited 3 more months to play it but i never could NOBODY BUY THIS ITS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY GUYS. far cry where have you gone i loved the other games but you have gone to crap just get rid of this game nobody plays it it does not even work im sorry but you lost a fan ubisoft,-1
"Off to a good start, this is finally another lighthearted, fun Telltale game.  It's less interactive than previous titles, however, in that there is virtually no walking around and freely inspecting things, or puzzles to solve. Instead, it solely relies on player dialogue and a few QTEs.",1

"Brace yourselves, this'll be a big one. Cave Story is a fantastic little bit of 2D indie gaming gold. The original Cave Story is free, and features the same game with 8 bit graphics and music. Cave Story+ improves everything. Better graphics, better music, and an option to change them back to normal if you want. Not to mention the addition of 'Curly Story' and challenges.  If you haven't played Cave Story yet, go ahead and try it. It's a homage back to NES/SNES adventure games, it especially resembles 'Metroid'. The gameplay, however, while being good, is not, in my opinion, the reason why it is a must play. To me, the best quality about it is the story that it tells, and the way it tells it. The last game that actually made me feel something was Amnesia, and that was warm liquid down my leg. The characters in Cave Story have left a serious impact on me. When [REDACTED] was [REDACTED] I was utterly shocked (lolspoilers). For ten bucks, I'd say it's a complete deal.",1
"Having too much fun playing to write an indepth review. Some people hate the new art style but I love it, even the fog. There are issues with the game for sure but not enough to interfere with the gameplay. If you are a fan of the series or like 4x games it is worth the buy. The patch took this game to another level. This is the most fun Civ I've played since Civ 2.",1

I have no stuttering with the game (though to get 60fps I have to run around medium). The game is much less of what the old cods were and more of an arcade game.

"I've now played 1 to 4 and I have to say I'm waiting on 5. However, this game is not without its issues. It almost kills its playability with the rabbit warren city levels - making you run round seemingly just to pad out playing time and with no effective maps or directions to help (trust me they are not worth using). That aside, the plot is engaging the dialogue is good and retains the feel of the previous adventures. So, it did enough to get me through the dross and found the game they want you to play.

"Quite possibly my favourite game ever. As a lover of emergent narratives, Crusader Kings 2 is unparallelled in this. Equal parts CRPG and strategy game, it posits you not as an abstract leading force of a nation or civilisation but a member of a dynasty of rulers whom you play until they die, whereupon you take control of their heir - and entirely likely, have to face with the issues of a new ruler and the potential succession crises that implies.",1
"It's quite an okay clone of the original 20th century X-COM games, but it doesn't really do a very good job of capturing the original game's flair.

"If there's one thing I can say beforehand, this game does not beat around the bush, no no no. It makes the target audience hide behind that bush and beat it there. Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 (for christ's sake, there's gonna be more) is the next game in the Sakura series, with twice as many boobs and 100% more male characters! ...but those are boring because they don't have breasts. In this game, unlike the previous ones, you can actually see your own character, which confused me at first because usually I wake up as a weird Weeaboo-guy from a dream going to school in these games. In Sakura Fantasy you wake up as a female! In the medieval times! But a weird alternative dimension of medieval times where women are allowed to leave the house and reveal more skin than their husbands. You are Rae... Ree... Raelin? A young female knight (yes) in a knight academy, surrounded by more boo- I mean girls. These girls have two personalities: Bossy and 'Notice me Senpai'. You're training because you're a knight I guess and as the story progresses you meet Waifu Number 5. I mean 3. Some empress lady with a cat sitting on her chest, nothing spectacular. As the story progresses you eventually find out that the town you live in is being attacked (I guess?) and that there's some sort of monsters living in a swamp, presumably Shrek. You go there in a dream for a first time, then wake up, see bossy character's ♥♥♥, story goes on, see boobs a few times and then actually go to the swamp, where a slime lady attacks you and your breast friends. I mean best friends. Later you meet some nature girl, go to her swamp village, an orc attacks, your clothes get torn, you win the game. I have to say, in comparison to the previous two sakura games, this one actually feels like more effort was put in the dialouge images of the characters. Instead of just changing their face they eventually move their forearm. And as silly as I described the story, this one seems to be the more explained and sense-making one, but it still gets overwhelmed by the ungodly amount of fanservice. It's literally 'chose your waifu' and reading. And since you're playing as a female the game thinks it's okay to show sensual pictures of your character french kissing other females, you know, medieval things. I can't say anything else about this, don't buy it, this was a gift (I'll kill you one day, Steve). Lesbians/10.",-1

I have played it 5 times start to finish and probably 300 hours. Hopefully when you read this review my hours played will be enough to convince you. (only 2 hours at the time of this review)  I myself have purchased this game 3 times, once for ps2, once for ps3 HD, and now once again for PC and i love every minute.  Currently playing at 1440p with all settings max and it looks amazing. Of course you have a few items and textures that are very PS2-esque but that is to be expected.",1
"Belgian humor, turn-based RPG, talking cows, tactical choices and throwing barrels at ennemies. What more could one want ? I have two main critics, the inventory and crafting are really messy",1
"I laughed alot through this. I also loved the music in the background  Also, you learn ♥♥♥♥",1
"A challenging puzzle game, that occasionally dips into being an action platformer. Not being much of a puzzle gamer enthusiast I don't really find overworking my brain to find the most efficient solutions of placing blocks in space and time that much fun. But it will make you think, exercising critical thinking while given new and odd rules to work with to earn your victories. It's got a lot of references to other games, so there is some neat trivia throughout.   Not my cup of tea, but still excellent at what it does. If you want a challenging game that isn't about reflexes, twitch reactions, grinding for better numbers, or memorization, this will certainly fulfill.",1
From just playing 8 minutes of this game this is what i learned... 1. Your sister HAS THE BIGGEST KNOCKERS ON THE F***ING PLANET 2. The main character is obsessed with ghosts 3. Giant F***ING MONSTERS POP OUT OF F***ING NOWHERE 4. Crabs and rats are the size of adult humans 5. If you're about to die just drink some alcohol that fixes you right up! 6. Drinking alcohol doesn't affect you whatsoever no matter how much you drink 7. If you try to shoot someone 3 feet in front of you YOU WILL MISS!!!  10/10 Would Bang,1
"3/10.  Real score-Turd/10.   This is a platformer that you play backwards. Interesting idea, but terrible execution. Levels are boring and empty. Graphics are from microsoft paint 1996. The real problem is the gameplay. Instead of moving backwards and playing like an actual platformer, this game has you only being able to press jump. The game moves your guy while the screen is continuously moving. Then, even worse, you can't choose when to jump. Because since you're playing backwards to you have to jump on every single guy that's dead or get/avoid every single coin or you lose the level. This makes it the opposite of a platformer where you get control, and instead basically a QTE game. The problem is with the terrible floaty inaccurate jumping you never know where you will land, leading to trial and error. Other times you don't know what you should do. All in all its not a platformer, but a game where you have 0 control and just press the right button or lose the level, and rinse and repeat.  ",-1
"This thing is free and like a 2mb download. Worth poking just based on that.  I've described it as an 'MMO Roguelike Bullet Hell'. You make a character, get tossed into a large overworld level with a bunch of people, and beat things for gear and EXP. When you die, your character is lost, but you can get to max level in an hour anyway.  There's not much depth; it's a mindless romp style game. The goal is to finish all the quests on a given map (with the help of the other players) and kill the big bad at the end. Secondarily each life is scored, and there's a high score board. Simple.  WoW or SWTOR it is not; it's not supposed to be. It's a quick 20min rampage with a bunch of people between 'real' games.",1
"So I bought this game off another digital download service a few years ago and it worked perfectly.  Then I had my old computer die on me and had to buy a new one and reinstall everything. So I head back there to redownload the game, only to find out they switched their original digital download to a Steam key.  'Hey, no biggie', I thought. 'Might as well have it on Steam'.  Except no. My perfectly good copy of the game has been switched for this Steam-ing pile of crap, complete with missing models and textures. It's not like I can reinstall it from a CD either. There WAS a perfectly fine digital download for this game, for which I paid, but I can't play it anymore, because someone somewhere decided that this is what Steam users would get. That's as if someone took the jewel case of your favorite album, and swapped the CD inside for a Nickelback CD (unless you're a Nickelback fan, in which case I hope God has mercy on your soul).   Of course, the digital download service won't do a refund due to the purchase having been made years ago, and I can't really get one from Steam either because I just activated my key here, so I'm basically screwed...   My advice is DO NOT BUY, even if they discount it at 75 cents. This is a thoroughly broken product, and it's extremely unlikely that it will ever be updated.",-1
"Yay, cancer!",1
"I'll give it a 6/10 its a fun game and all but its buggier than hell and it sometimes crashes, never had these kinda issues with M&amp;B Warband......if you still want to check it out i would buy it when its 75% off that way you saying WTF is this a Beta version",-1
"From the darkness, a ray of hope sees my eyes flick open: I am a god. How long have I slept? A century? My worshippers, so few now, I must guide them...  For this player, 'Thea: The Awakening' has been a love at first sight affair. The player takes the role of a deity, who in turn takes the role of a group of followers. These followers have emerged from an apocalypse of darkness only to have the new dawn illuminate further perils to come. Despite this premise, set in a decidedly dark fantasy world, I cant help but think of Rick from the Walking Dead as I direct my group of survivors to scavenge supplies and fortify, survival our primary concern. I begin to grow attached to each individual in the group. I realise this as night approaches and the sunlight retreats. The dead walk tonight, not far from my settlement, and my four best fighters are out on a salvage mission. To the north my lookouts spot giant spiders scuttling through the dusky gloom. Supplies are getting low, and our resident medic may be about to have a very busy night. My non combatants arm themselves as best they can and they pray for me to guide them to dawn...  What is not to like? Buy this if you like fantasy games, survival games, games with crafting and gathering, heroes that have to eat, games where you can rename every villager and hero you own, card games, TBS games, games where combat is an option but not the only way to get through the night... This hybrid is something special. Just one turn more, right? Yeah right.",1
It's fun for a while to be a God,1
"i hear all this tak about the game crashing ,but i haven't had that problem. I love this game it's fun and a good time killer. The only con about this game is the frame cap.",1
"This game has a good player base and 99% of the time people are friendly. More of a mature audience. The game has good graphics and story rich line. Good character customization, and Class picks. The only downfall is that it is too grindy. It involves alot of what the game calls Leve quests, which you use to level up jobs and classes. I like the fact that you get chocobo as a companion that levels up. Definately a Final Fantasy storyline and gameplay. The game also utilizes starting and low level areas of the game. Although i never got to max level or got the expansion, i found that it was enjoyable player base and lots of people to meet. I would recommend this game to people that are interested in Final Fantasies, and people that have alot of time on their hands that enojoy leveling up their character. Overall this game is great and the people made it better.",1
"I went to American Hogwarts, knocked into British American Snapes and ended the game almost being sold into slavery by a assdemon. All in all, a pretty fun time at school. 8D",1
"I've only played a few minutes of this game and I can already tell you It's fun. If you like these types of games you'll like this. It's essentially a slightly different take on the bridge constructor games. It's one of those games you break out on a rainy day to pass some tme or if you're just looking for a challenge. I found some of the puzzles to actually be a bit difficult and require planning and/or multiple run throughs.   There are a few things that need to be tweaked though.   1) The menu with the building options shouldn't pop in/out, it needs to stay static 2) There needs to be a quick way to undo placement (Like an undo button). 3) There needs to be a way to observe projectile path. Right now you need to play the scenario over and over to plan out your building, which is kind of a pain.",1

"GREAT GAME, may not be the best graphics, but highest level of competition BY FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! only the skilled will survive!",1
"I bought this game because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Upon closer inspection, it seems the vast majority of those 300 positive reviews were fake/bought by the developer. If you read enough of them you will see the same few ideas repeated over and over again in a slightly different way. The story and dialogue are as long and time consuming as they are terrible (EXTREMELY). I played three hours and spent like 2 of those hours reading text. When you do get to play the combat offered no challenge whatsoever. The leveling gives no customization choices, simply get a new skill and stats boost. I could go on and on like this but try the game yourself and you will see how bad it is. Nevermind $32 on sale, I wouldn't play this game for free, and am requesting a refund. If my refund is denied, I will never play it again. DELETED. I especially find the use of fake positive reviews infuriating and feeling like my time was wasted and my money stolen.",-1

much better than simcity,1
Not a bad game if you want to take a break from games you're more dedicated to. Unfortunatly its very short...like 12-15 hours short depending if you try to explore more of the linear maps. Good for 40 bucks though.,1

Three reasons to buy this game. It will make you sail a lot. It will make you read a lot. It will try to kill you a lot. Now just buy it and go drown in the world that is Sunless Sea.,1
"A major Improvement on Rome 2 with lots of new ingame features, my biggest gripe is unlike in previous total war games when everything panned out diffrently each time, because its focused on the fall of the roman empire I feel like they are very weak as they pay larger Upkeep costs and recruitment costs meaning smaller armies meaning the roman empires can easily be streamrolled and this takes away from the overall game as the Western Roman Empire specifically might only last around 100 turns, which is only around 25 years ingame time. The game can also sometimes feel like its over before its really started. What i mean by this is the action if fast and intense, if you play as a Roman nation if you do survive the first onslaught, you will likely feel like the game has become incredibly easy. (I found this at least). Only other issue i can think of is the Ai can be extremely aggressive towards the player especially when you play as a hoard nation and sometimes hoards seem to have a six sense for where you are moving your armies, and will constantly outrun your forces until your turn around or take enough losses then they won't stop hunting you until everything you love is destroyed.  Basically if you want a challenge this is the game for you, i've never really lost a campaign on any other total war, but my first playthrough as the Huns led to a civil war where i was hunted down and slowly eliminated cultivating in a last stand just outside constantinople.  Highly recommend, perhaps dosen't live up to Shogun 2 but its a good heading for the total war series 7/10",1
"I can't recommend this game, only for the fact that customer service on their website is terrible.  I placed an order a year and a half ago. Haven't gotten my cards and when I asked to cancel my order, they said my address was wrong when shipped. When I first placed my order my zip code was wrong but I had contacted them beforehand and they said they had fixed it.  After replying to them with this I hadn't heard anything since. And I still haven't gotten my refund.  Before this incident I rather did enjoy the game.",-1
Very repetitive. I'm not even sure what I'm fighting for. Just strolling through level after level without any hint of a challenging opposition. Boring.,-1
Made me defecate uncontrollably several times. 10/10 would kill religious nuts again.,1
"This game is overall one of the best I've played so far! I've played games with goals to achieve, and those types of games are actually really fun.

"Hi all who read this,  It is now over a year and I still wasted my money on this game. This game came out with high expectations and none of them where actually implemented in the original game. But what about the game... my opinion: - Graphics, epic! really awesome even on medium graphic it looks good - Unit variation, a lot, far to many choices if you ask me. Because of those unit cards you miss the feel of the different units in your army. - Length of the game, in mp and sp you have a lot of gameplay ahead of you, so you dont have to be bored for the next up coming month.  Specific: - SP: in my opinion it takes to long. The map is just to big, I am forgeting in late game half of my armies. Even the turns take longer then 20 min in late game! (without even a battle!!).  - MP: dont even bother to click on it.... It is the worst total war multiplayer you will ever see.   Recommendations: Dont buy it! Buy a good solid TW game like napoleon, empit(r)e or shogun &lt;3",-1
"Simply amazing. Loved everything about this game. The art, the story, the creatures, the combat, the easter eggs, everything. Starts off a bit slow and you don't get much of a feel for the story until about two thirds through when it suddenly gets interesting. Very colourful and Dust is a great protagonist imo. Has his demons which is good to see in a hero. The ending got me a little teary but I'm girly like that. Well worth a thorough playthrough. Money very well spent. Can't recommend this game enough.",1
"I have no idea how this has so many good reviews when it's got one flaw; basically rendering it unplayable. Deleting plants is way too easy, in fact I found I deleted almost half my plants by accident in less than 10 minutes of play.   Basically, a confirm prompt before deleting, or if deleting threw things back into the seed bin rather than removing them from the pot forever, or if you had to click a 'delete' icon at the bottom of the screen and THEN click on a plant, any of that would make the game playable, but just having a little x show up that's barely visible and deleting the plant if we click near it is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Especially if you're expecting us to possibly pay real money for these damn things, letting us delete them forever at a tiny misclick with no confirm prompt is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid at best, and evil and cynical at worst.",-1
This Game Doesnt work,-1
Been playing a pacifist playthrough its been tough but ive enjoyed it 10/10,1
"NEVER SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPERS AGAIN! THEY ARE JUST MONEY GRABBING SCUMBAGS!  This is the SECOND game with a huge amount of potential they they decided to abandon once their time in the limelight was finished. They will end up making a third game at some point in an attempt to 'rekindle' with their fanbase, when in reality they just want more easy money! Hands down, the next game they make will also be abandoned in the same way that this one was.  I used to LOVE playing this game with my friends. We would always come home from school back in the early days and hop on to maintain our kingdoms. The fact that this game was abandoned does not surprise me, but it still hurts just as bad as a sucker punch to the gut.   I don't understand why the developers couldn't just open up their games to the modding community. What have you guys got to lose? You're already ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in everyones faces and stopping maintenece on the game, and without help it will become just as much of a buggy, dead, piece of crap as Starforge.   I remember reading the raving reviews of when this game first came out. I had no idea it was the same company that had run Starforge into the ground, but one person pointed out that this would happen. That person made a review that was completely washed out by the tons of positive reviews from people who bought the game either out of self interest, or because their favourite youtuber at the time was playing it. That review explained that the companies were the same, and that this exact day would come. That one person was right.   All in all it's a shame that this company even exists. In my opinion, they are right up there with the makers of Infestation: Survival stories (Formerly The War Z), and Romero's Aftermath. Two of their games that were not only met with disgust from the community for lack of support for the game, but also for the overall quality of gameplay as updates slowly began to vanish. Now guess what! They are on to a third game, which in my mind, without a doubt, will be met with great community feedback. That is exactly how they end up sucking you in. Infestation was great at a time, believe it or not. But their Shattered Skies has a bad omen around it, and I can just see it tanking as bad as their other two.   Now, many of the people who bothered to read this far might be wondering, 'Now why did he just go off topic to talk about another game that (At this time) hasn't even been released yet? It looks amazing!'. Well, allow me to explain. The two developers that made these games (RoK and Infestation for reference) are extremely similar. They seem to get behind a game, make an amazing product, and then once the money begins to dwindle, they tank the game and drop support for it. If Hammerpoint Interactive makes a third game on the same thesis and look of the other two, what is stopping Code Hatch from doing the same thing?  Please, make an educated buy before ever supporting EITHER of these developers ever again. They aren't in it for the gamer, they are only in it for the gamer's wallet.  TL;DR Never buy another game from Code}{atch or Hammerpoint Interactive again. They are a disgrace to the gaming community.",-1
"How to play this game: 1. Move curser over girl.  2. Click. 3. Repeat until you get enough gold to buy an ally who will click so you don't have to.  4. Do nothing while the game plays itself.   This isn't a game; games have a story, animation, puzzles and/or stategy.",-1
"The game is fun, but there are many reasons not to buy the game.  Graphically the game doesn't change much from low detail settings to high ones (high detail is not really THAT detailed), most animations are clunky, there are serious graphical glitches, and finding 3 of them on 3h of casual gameplay is quite a lot if you ask me. Now, the players, if you get to play with all players with low ping values (30~60) the game is mostly nice, otherwise people teleport... and if you try to hit an afterimage of a guy who's actually a few steps further, you leave yourself open for counterattacks and die. No fun about it. Finally, gamemodes, there are a lot (a lot with text glitches which render incomprehensible the actual objective too) and since the community is quite a bad one, the experience, especially in more complex game modes, is really poor/bad.  Don't get me wrong, there are also reasons to like and play the game, like medieval warfare, pretty nice sword/axe/spear/bow/... fight, few interesting game modes, but for me they are still not enough to keep me playing this one.  Would I recommend this game? Probably no. Would I recommend this game for $1? Definitely yes, one of the best casual games ever made (for those few minutes you get to actually enjoy it)",-1
"Played through this one again recently after getting it on the PS3 years ago.  Not as big as Arkham City, it's still a pleasure to revisit the asylum and see where it all began for the best Batman game series.",1
"Much better than I was expecting. This is a good solid fun game that captures nicely the survival panic of a zombie apocalypse rather than going for the Rambo with unlimited ammo hoo-rah nonsense of many other zombie games.  Don't worry you still get to pop some zombie skull, but the focus on building a community with the resource and personality issues which are entailed therein. It is actually much more enjoyable than that sentence sounds. There is always a balance in choosing which missions you can run, and this inability to do everything is the only reason I forgave one of my personal bugbears in games: The Autosave Only system.   Here it actually has a rare useful mechanic of upping the ante on your characters, in that their skills all increase independently and based on their actions, so if you have built up some ubermench they can still be taken down by some bad luck with a feral zombie and then they are gone for good and you continue with some chump that hasn't had any experience.  Too often in games after the mid-point your character is essentially unkillable, but State of Decay manages to keep the threat and risk levels up without resorting to any cheap tricks or stupid boss fights to achieve this.  There were a couple of minor glitches (zombies and npcs getting stuck on objects) but none were game breaking and it was beginning to end a stable experience.  Solid 4/5 and well worth it at $20 (less on sale of course)",1
An example of good behavior from game developers.,1
"Although I have not got manny hours on this game, I have had the game on android for around two and a half years, the PC port still needs a little bit of refining, however this game has a great future if the developer keeps content fresh, as they have done on the android version and also so far on the PC version. This game is great if you are looking to pass the time and even play for a while as you will certainly get hooked once you advance through the story, the farming part so far is great, considering the game is called farm life I should hope so too! the activities like horse racing and fishing (etc...) are great fun and give the game an enjoyable feel.  I would certainly recommend this game to my friends especially if they have ever played a game called harvest moon, it has a similar feel with very unique differences, if you are coming here looking for a game like stardew valley then unfortunately you should stop comparing, the game is different although it has a similar style of gameplay! Having said this I would give this game a shot as it is only £1.99, not much to lose and there is definitely great enjoyment to be had!",1
"After a prolonged period of early access time, the game's finally been rushed out and it's still pretty god damn awful despite numerous updates and attempts to add more content.  There's a mission where the game decides to throw a constant stream of 180 dwarves at you with only 15 minutes of preperation time beforehand.  Regardless of what you do, you die.  There's not enough time to rebuild your forces even if you go insane with prisons and torture chambers. (It probably doesn't help that your succubi die far too quickly for them to be of any use. The best part is when your creatures become tired and then try to go to sleep in their lairs on very little health (there's never enough mana to heal everything), so what happens is that your creatures get murdered in their sleep by the invading 180 dwarves. The best thing however is when your creatures aren't being attacked for a nanosecond and then decide to go to the treasure room for payday, and conveniently the dwarves have a nice big wave coming in at that time. Oh boy oh boy oh boy.   The main problem with this game is that it tries to copy dungeon keeper 2 way too much, even though it's the second worse dungeon keeper game. This game has a really crappy atmosphere and all the creatures are a load of wank and there doesn't seem to be enough depth in the right places.   Sure it's got the ~veins of evil~ but that's just a messy list of tech upgrades that just give you more useless/highly situational abilities that you'll use once in a mission that requires you to use it and then you'll never use it ever again. There's also no level editor which really sucks because these dungeon keeper style of games would be really great with level editors.   Instead of trying to balance the campaign so that it's actually playable past mission 7, the developers seem to be making a survival mode instead which I assume is an even more poorly designed version of mission 7.   It's a real shame that every game that tries to emulate dungeon keeper's success/style just ♥♥♥♥s it up completely.",-1
"Just great cooperative fun, like the original but with a lot more content and depth. Grab some buddies and/or some randoms and feel like a total heister badass.",1
"From all the fighting games I've played overthe years, this has to be one of the most challenging but also fun to play one xD The anime-like drawing style is also pretty well done (if you're into that). It has a decent back story and the characters have their own decent storyline.  All in all it's a fun game to play!... especially if you're beating the crap out of your friends, haha XD",1
"Not really recommendable game with its bad gameplay, bad animations and bad everything else, but i found it good enough for its 0.09 euro price.   That said i still played it trough for some reason. 3 hour gametime maximum.  If you are really really bored and enjoy point and click games just a little then sure, try this out",-1

"This game is not the best MMO I've ever played. Blockbusters like WoW or SWTOR beat it by throwing sheer volumes of money at every problem. But this game doesn't try to compete in their arena, and in doing so became the most interesting MMO I've ever played.  Ever standard complaint of the genre is, if not fixed, at least tweaked. Sick of boring Kill X, Gather Y quests? The Secret World has the most involved quest lines I've ever played. Even their most basic missions are steeped in enough lore to keep you engadged and their legendary Investigation missions earn every bit of praise they've aquired. Tired of spammers filling chat with goldfarming ads and racist tirades? The TSW community is only interested in sharing theories and, occasionally, bad puns. Heck, just don't like monthly subscription fees? Pay once, play forever! And don't worry, while there is an add-on store, it's used entirely for cosmetics, convenience, and story additions. No pay-to-win here.  If you're a fan of contemporary fantasy or cosmic horror genres, this is an absolute must. Even if you're just a casual MMO player interested in seeing how the genre can work when it's trying desperately to make the Blizzard lightning strike twice, this is a game worth seeing.  Come on... take a peek behind the curtain of reality.",1

"An X-Com game turned into a 1960's based Mass Effect style game, and not in a good way. It's like ME2 and 3 in that the mainline, gun combat has had too much focus. Upgrades do not reflect weapon tech level (bullets, laser, then plasma), where as soldiers can, at the start when you only have the starting weapons, have tech for, say, a turret, that uses tech based off of the alien's weapons. Any and all choices you make (and side missions) will have 0, repeat, 0 impact on the story, as (SPOILIER) X-Com HQ eventually gets attacked and destroyed, killing virtually everyone inside of the base save for some major characters. The whole idea of 'having to take alien weapons that haven't been destroyed by operator death using the Venn Brace (the device on Carter's arm in virtually all screen shots)' is just stupid. The AI isn't the brightest. The game also lacks a key aspect of X-Com and it's choices: will this work out in the long run.  Lets use X-Com: Enemy Unknown for example: You recieve an abduction mission. You have to pick one of three. One is in St. Petersburg, and Russia is offering a new sniper, at the rank of captian. Your's is a squaddie, as you had to replace your previous one. Then there's one in New York. The US is offering 4 scientists. You have completed all projects that will be fast, and are on a long term one (10 days left). Then you have one in Cairo. Egypt is offering 200 credits. You recently bought a satilite, and still have room for one more. Europe and NA has their panic raised to 2, amd if you don't pick it, it will raise to 4, hanging on the edge of full panic and risking leaving, or staying. The sattilite construciton is cutting the montly report close, but you may have time to place that sattilite over the one of the paniced countries. And there MAY be a chance of a Terror mission. What I have given you is a typical scenario, in both EU and EW. The player may think this: 'That sniper is good, it can make my squads stronger, and I don't have to worry about my normal sniper becoming wounded. But, I need those Scientists so I can research Plasma weapons faster, make my soldiers better in the field. Although, I could use those funds, and can use two sattilites to lower more countries panic.' For this, there is no right or wrong answer. And there is a chance that this can make or break your run.  However, for the Bureau, there are no hard choices. You can do as many side missions, and send as many side agents out before you continue on with the story. The even added a cliche 'character sacrifice' on the finally mission, (SPOILER) having you pick between Agent Weaver, Director Faulke, or Doctor Weir (depending on who you picked to continue as in the level prior). There is no sense of loss, as you can't even use the character you just rescuesed, esentially giving you a hollow choice.  This game was labeled an X-Com game and had potential. It did not live up to it.",-1

"Good atmosphere but with an abrupt ending. The game length is maybe 3 to 4 hours. While short games aren't bad, I didn't feel there was a proper amount of build up to the ending. As mentioned before, the experience is great until it suddenly ends. Still, worth a play through.  ",1

"One of the best games of our generation. An easy buy and a must for every person who wants to call himself a gamer. Its an amazing idea with an increadible execution. If the amazing 10 hour game time is not enough valve made the workshop to extend the lifespan of the game by alot ! Its worthy every euro I have spent on it and I would buy it again a million times.  No hopes for Portal 3 though, but believing that the company that can not count to three will launch it, is what keeps me driving everyday from when I wake up, until I go to sleep.  10/10",1
"This was my original review of this game, and I had recommended it to others: 'Fun game--great to relax to. No need to buy extras unless you really want to. In early play in the game it costs more to play than you 'earn' by winning, but play through and soon earning plenty to play and get extras.'  Now, I no longer recommend this game to others, and although I still play some, I am very close to quitting. Here are just a few of my thoughts:  So far, I do not like anything about this new update. The previous update was a degradation of the game, but this one has taken the game to a point where I feel like I am 'slogging through' an unpleasant experience rather than enjoying an engaging fun game. When I started playing the game it was relatively easy to understand the play and logic, and it was a nice way to relax after a day of work. It took some thought and strategizing to improve your game, building teams for different purposes and using them to advantage under differing circumstances. Leveling up is now too complicated, and even the 'buying' rewards with earned glory or gems, etc, has now essentially become so complcated or expensive (seemingly targeted at the pay to play audience), I no longer have incentive to play enough to 'earn' enough to buy a reward of armour, additional character or new weapon.  Now everything that was relaxing and casual (and fun) about the game has been taken away or changed. I have previously recommended this game to others, however, do not believe will do so again. The last update seemed geared towards smart phone or tablet users, and the appearance of the cards/characters changed significantly. Most of the character/card appearance updates were not positive.   Please bring back the original game as it was--roll back to a couple of updates ago and release it as a 'version 1' or 'classic'. I did like the addition of new kingdoms, rewards, arena, and maps. It would have been better to have rolled out a different version ('gold' or 'championship' or even as simple as 'gems of war 2') to make these changes, rather than so drastically altering the play of what had been a very fun, enjoyable and relaxing game.",1

Hook is a well designed solid puzzle game. For the price of .99 cents it is totally worth it. I read a review saying that it has about an hour of play time and they were spot on. I reccomend you pick this game up if you like puzzle games and want to support a good game designer.,1
"Awesome game, spent more time with this than i would with some AAA titles.  great variety with different classes, randomness with all the different items to unlock and equip. combat is fast paced and difficult, but never mercilessly so. interesting lore and background from monsterlogs, all in all tons of value for your money!   10/10",1

"Hilarious game, But quite accurate representation of the microtransaction/ DLC in today's game, Loved it!",1
This game runs like ♥♥♥♥ but if you lock the frame rate to 30 fps it runs fine. The first episode is very action orinted and the second episode has a lot more tense momments and adds a few new cool features into the game. Raid mode is like a mini rpg in the game as you can level up your characters and buy new weapons and aquire new skills for your character. Each mission takes you through classic resident evil levels and can have different objectives such as a time run or defend an area.  Updated* The game has been updated so it now runs a bit better and does not need to be locked at 30fps as they have fixed the animation stutter. The rest of the episodes where very good but the ending was a bit dissapointing.  7.5/10 To much water,1
"Unique, funny and challenging, Papers Please is unlike any other game you've ever played. Set in a fictional totalitarian country, you act as a border checkpoint guard struggling to keep your family warm, fed, and healthy. Paid by the number of people you screen daily, you will encounter forgers, smugglers, and, even more morally challenging, people trying to visit sick relatives with improper paperwork. Do you call to your humanity, let them through, and risk your family's welfare and imprisonment? Or do you stamp denied on their passport to their curses and possible future retributions?  To say more of this very clever game would spoil it but it is a steal at the price for modern gaming ingenuity at its finest.",1

"Fallout 3 was and still is one of my top 3 games of all time. This game was the game that really introduced me to great culture and awesome sand boxing experience. I loved this game. Unfortunately, on the PC version of fallout 3, one can only run into trouble trying to play this game. Unless you run an older computer with windows XP and a single processor, then you'll be fine. Why the gaming company did not just release a simple patch that could fix the comparability issues with newer computers, I do not know. It came out when windows 7 was here..... So instead of a patch i could download, I was forced to spend hours of my time, not playing this game, but trying to make it work by searching forum after forum, mod page after mod page until i fixed the INI file, which i thought was already added, because it should have been. Despite all of the issues with the PC version i still believe this classic game is a one of a kind adventure worth taking if you have a fair understanding of file management and modding manually, but because this game is not new user friendly i still do not recommend it for all and thus i can't recommend this game.",-1
"Upgrades and fancy graphics definitely made space invaders better. The controls can be a little bit frustrating at times, but when you're used to it, and playing in full screen to avoid the mouse leaving the screen, it can be a lot of fun.",1

"Probably one of my most favorite Total War games throughout the whole franchise, besides Shogun 2.  The raw amount of options to consider when running your empire are like Europa Universalis but without the micro management and waiting. The game excels in fort battles and naval battles, probably the most satisfying moments are using 2 first of the line ships to sandwhich and massacre a whole crew within seconds, screenshots are necessary,",1

"I bought this game because I really enjoyed playing Sniper Elite V2 and 3. So my expectation was quite high when I started playing this. In the beginning, I was a little surprised that the gameplay does actually differ quite a bit from Sniper Elite. Instead of focusing on stealth, you need to kill Zombies pretty fast here. This makes the other weapons way more important than they were in the sniper series where I never used any with the exception of the silenced gun. Even the kicks are required here which adds to the variety of combat behavior.  Enemy variety is pretty decent as well. Yesterday I met the summoners and really enjoyed the work when I saw how they hold their head all the time as if they were in pain -&gt; headache relief is a great name for an achievement in this context :D. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet but all the fun is definitely worth the asking price from my point of view even though you will recognize all maps/buildings from the Sniper games. It's a great game and hope to see more of it in the future!",1

Pros: - Gameplay hasn't changed that much (animals about the only major one) - Better graphics on the equipment - New maps - New crops/animals  Cons: - No major changes to economy, only a few new crops  I know the cons are similair to the pros, but it would have been nice to see some more ground breaking changes.

"The first thing that struck me about super hot is the minimal graphics, they're stunningly vivid, and at the same time, have the feeling that their purpose is primarily functional. I have sunk too many hours into this game. Its story is very short, but what super hot offers is addictive, and challenging. The story is easy enough, but racking up giant scores in the endless mode is where I found the most fun. And watching the real time replay is remeniscient of a fast paced matrix loby scene. The story, though short, encapsulates an amazing tone and emotion for the game. I won't spoil specifics, but it held my attention until it was over, and then opened up a range of challenges that I was itching to tackle. For me, the $25 price tag wasn't too much, because it combined my favorite aspects of my favorite action games, and left me thinking, while repeating the game's title over and over again in my head. If you're on the fence, or only looking to complete the story, You may want to wait for a sale.",1

"Hey, everyone up this so Sean sees it, people, come one!  Dearest Sean, I'm a big fan of good intentions, and in regards to the concept, we're all right there with you, buddy. But looking at the patch plans you got going, I'd say this:  Forget about base building and space naked ladies and just focus on finishing the game we talked about, right? So:   -Actual suns  -INTRAplanet variety, please. Look at our planet, man! It's not just one thing. There's all kinds of things happening within the same planet.  -Better scale. It does NOT take me 20 years to walk around a planet, it takes me like 2 hours. That's dumb.  -Actual biodomes and not just ten random creatures roaming about, even simples relationships would do, right?  -Different sized plantes should have different gravity, right? Jetpack fans looking for tiny moons to play around in, right?  -Now you've put in a sun, make the planets actually go around it! Not a math wiz, but shoulnd't be that hard, I mean, you've already built the galaxy, right?  -All planets should not have evenly distributed resources. Some planets should have no buildings. Most should have a few large concentrations, tha way you could get a lot done in a 'city' type of environment, instead of every single planet having dotted buildings. That only makes sense for research purposes, like for planets full of fauna, for instance, or maybe in mineral heavy planets, 'mining' outposts and trading outposts. Same for resources. Can you imagine what fun heartbrake at seeing 50 gold mines in a single mountain or cave and having a single inventory slot left? Good fun.  -While I'm here, the scan should build you a map of the planet, not with every specific thing, but with general pointers, 'cause losties will get lost, man. At least a north-south reference point of some kind, otherwise it's JUST dirt, or grass-covered dirt, sometimes...  -Why do all bodies of water, even 'oceans' feel like puddles, or lakes? Not sure, but they do. Think about it, hit me back, son.  -The graphical effect for wormholling is lame. There's some werid stars in the backrop. Just make the star map which you already made go faster, son, don't be silly. You already have that feature bound to shift, just make another setting for wormholes, instead of x2, x100. There you go, free of charge. No royalties necessary.  -The interface, man... Jesus the interface. Can I walk twenty paces without being interrupted by a scinematic screen there for no reason? I mean... I do love you guys, but damn...  -Once I have 48 inventory slots, both drop pods AND the first part of the second door in space stations becomes useless, what?  Oh, and if you are DEADSET on more features, forget about basebuilding, that's silly for an exploration game, just make things better, you know?  Like, let me have as a long-term goal ship tinkering, for instance, get a basic design, then let me mess around with those procedurally generated parts. Same for omnitool. Oh, this fixes it: Make those inventory slots be insertible into ships and omnitools, man, then after everything is maxed, make them increase stack sizes! For the crazies, you know?  In summary, dear Sean, just to recap, we're with you, and we get the idea, it's a chill game, it's about exploration, I'm not with the pijama people who wanted to download into NMS and live there, but just... finish it, you know, man? Give me that giant worm going through the desert with a ruined city in the background, and all that Dune goodness.  Allright, get to work, buddy, we love ya, okay? Don't let the naysayers let you down, we can wait a little more.  Much, much love,  Somebody.",1

"Absolutely adorable game that oozes Doublefine charm. You play as a bunch of kids who get wrapped up in a halloween monster plot to steal all the world's candy. The gameplay is somewhere inbetween the Mario RPG games (Superstar saga, Paper Mario) and South Park Stick of Truth, with your kids actually turning into their costume for the battle. There's a heap of unlockable costumes which act as character classes and a few other clever ways to customise your guys. It's just all round fun.  I really wouldn't be surprised if the guys that made Stick of Truth were inspired by this. They're ridiculously similar, in a good way! It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Definitely grabbing the sequel :D",1
"The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom -PC-  The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is the “Dr. Seus” of 2D platform gaming. It plays well, it has a fun “indie” artistic style, and it narrative overlay is cleaver and witty. While it lasts, these misadventures are a great fun, unfortunately I plowed through this game is just a couple short hours. I would have liked to have seen a full scale adventure, but for what you pay for, it is well worth it.  In the game your objective is to try to get your character (who is a mix between Yogi Bear and Scrooge Mcduck) to collect all the pies on the screen. The premise sounds simple, but it will soon become apparent that some of these pies are tricky sons of a gun to collect.  The levels are separated into sets of levels. At the beginning of a set, the game will introduce to you a new game mechanic, and for the rest of the levels collecting pies will be become increasingly more complex. Collecting pies has never been this hard before! The game mechanics are fresh and intuitive. I will not give any of the game mechanics away, for it would ruin the whole mystique. The new game mechanics really set The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom apart from other generic puzzle side scrollers. I applaud the high standard of creativity.  Almost every puzzle is set in a static screen, there won’t actually be much side scrollin’ action in this game, only in the later levels you’ll be able to side scroll. I think this was because of the nature of these puzzles. They can get really tricky, and it is helpful to have the whole puzzle right in front of you at all times. I do prefer the classic side scroller, and many times the levels in this game felt like a puzzle level from “Tetris Attack” or “Yoshi’s Cooke”, I still enjoyed it.  As you run around as Mr Winterbottom, he controls reasonably well. He is not perfectly precise, but you rarely if ever will be punished for not being exact; your objective is to collect pies and as long as any part of you guy touches a pie, you’ll collect it. The whole game is based on puzzles and not perfectly executed maneuvering (even though some levels trick you into thinking so)  The story and narrative are reminiscent of popular children books. The phrasing rhymes, and come 2 lines at a time. There are still pictures that accompany every described location. I looked forward to the narrative as it came and I read and enjoyed every line.  The only real problem with The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is that it is too short. I completed the game fully in less than 4 hours. Given, I am a wizard of sorts, but there just isn’t as much content as I would have liked. I can’t really complain cause I got the game for like $5 off of a Steam sale.  The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is a great diversion with plenty of re play-ability: weather it be in attempts to get a better score / time or to watch someone else solve the puzzles for the first time, it is plenty of fun. I have suggested this game to a number of people, as I think it can be fun for a very broad # of people. Go and play you some Mr Winterbottom!

"This game, is truely like being part of a movie. More than any game I have played before. I have always been a fan of the Alien franchise, and was annoyed at the mediocre games created before given the story material available and the possibilities the formiddable Xenomorph allows. The game has great graphics, a grainy old school feel to the levels, and all the same sort of tech used in the original movie. So for a sci-fi it does appear dated, but that;s because so much attention to detail was made to recreate the look and feel of the movie. I only wish SEGA had put this much love and effort into Colonial Marines.  Gameplay is FPS standard, but guns aren't much use in the game (largely ineffective against many enemies, plus gunfire attracts the Alien). You spend most of it walking slowly or crouching so nothing will hear you. And believe me, the Alien is not the only thing to worry about in the game.  This is a survival horror like no other I've seen or played. Worthy of it's Game of the Year Awards. One of the few games I'd buy at full price. Play it if you're an Alien fans, it's the best game ever about them.  Play it if you like survival horrors that don't just involve shooting your way out of trouble. Play it if you like to be scared.  Play it if you like strategy. The Alien can be anywhere any time, which makes getting around tricky.",1

However, having played DmC 4, I would presonally reccomend that one over this one. The combat system is very fluid on Controller, K+M? No idea. Sadly, the story is lacking, however it does give us a nice retelling of Dante's origin. The DLC? I didn't like it as much as the main game, it was hard to get into.",1

"Wait for steam sale. The game is optimized good for pc but is a portable game. 60fps and up to 4k resolution. Most of the combat is 3 combo attacks, jump attack, ranged atk for 3-4 shoots.  There are different weapons and different blood arts, but you can only have one bloodart which turns your 3 combo into ranged, lifesteal, or debuffs. Yes technically there is variety but it all comes back down to 3 combo spamming. The maps are just generic corridors. If you like monster hunter like games you probably would like it, but from my perspective of playing mmo's and other fighting games i expecting 4-10+ abilities as option in combat. I think i would have more fun with multiplayer, but any game is like that.",1

"A good story with a solid game-play design behind it. Even if the story ends up being more linear than you expect you would never know your first time through.

"If you are thinking about buying this, read this review, I will try to give you all the information shortened.  This is not like old days GTA. It is another game , a more commercial one. You are in a city Los Santos and... Why don't you watch some videos? There are thousands of them.   Pros: 1.Singleplayer is not bad 2.Multiplayer exists 3.A lot of content 4.Good graphics 5.A lot of voice acting 6.Good voice acting 7.A lot of different - cars faces people buildings locations and many more 8.Some interesting heists  Cons: 1.Important! The game does not make the feeling when you are on a heist, I mean even if you have a stealth mission it ALWAYS comes to the point when you gotta shoot. And not just shoot, but kill 200 policemen trying to stop you even if you do everything right you will get somewhere with a lot of space and the melee will begin. 2.Boring multiplayer 3.A lot of killers on multiplayer 4.A lot of hackers on mp 5.A few things you can do with a car or any vehicle : forward, backward, left or right, no slowing speed, not even lowering your side glasses! 6.Pay to win  If you are like me, and buy this game here is what is going to happen. You go to Singleplayer, you buy a lot of guns and you start destroying everything and soon realise that: policemen waves are infinity and you can not blow any structures and finally get killed. After that there is not many exciting things to do.  The price is not tha good for a game like this, If you are too eager to buy and play this wait for a sale. I did not write as much as it was needed but that was going to make the review boring. I hope I helped. ",-1
This is my favorite Total War yet. It is the perfect game for any gamer who likes leading his troops into battle and letting them have a little fun. Best stratagy game of the year. I rate it 6 waffles out of 5,1

"Good solid game. Similarities with Puzzle Quest buts offers richer character and team modiication but lacks the RPG elements of exploring locations that the PQ2 offered. That said, I think the depth and difficulty is perfect and will keep you engaged a lot longer than you originally planned.",1
dis game pertty awesome,1
Nice graphics and intense multiplayer game,1
Literally makes your brain dive into the atomosphere of the Metro. Has a good story line with hard and challenging parts if playing on hard difficulty. I payed about 4 bucks for the game and let me tell you this is better then some of the 60 dollar titles. Regardeless totally worth.,1
no it is too hard on laptop ,-1
"Oh boy the game everybody has been waiting for, SURELY the newest GTA won't have ALL of the issues that GTA-4 had, I mean it does NOT have GFWL, it's years later so it SHOULD have better servers... the story mode SHOULD have a character creater mode (Something ALL of the Saints Row games HAVE had, &amp; the story mode not only did NOT suffer, but was awesome for what it was [I think the last 2 SR games story about Hell was/are utterly stupid])... I digress SURELY this latest GTA game will be ALL of the things a game like this SHOULD be, coming from a company all of Us loyal, PAYING fans made rich with so many purchases of their games over the years... SURELY this game is AWESOME-SAUCE dipped in molten CHOCOLATE?!?   No sorry, this game is WAY worse with the idiotic, ghetto-trash, single charcter (if you play as anybody else in story later I'll never find out, I have no desire to be a ghetto-trash, wanna-be, gangsta minority in ANY game), with a playable NWA music video for a story mode, one that's ridiculously perverted (h0m0s3xual dogs3x... your aunt asking for footrubs, &amp; other inapropriate physical attention, etc.), utterly stupid in the way the games inhabitants act, AND speak, Oh, &amp; you CAN play offline with a whole bunch of characters (I can EVEN make one that looks like Me), but you'll get no weapons, no missions, &amp; cannot save any progress [dirrector mode]...  I have SIXTY MB/s netspeed on a 'gaming' PC that's less then a year old... I can play lagfree on MMOs with servers over 5 thousand miles accross the ocean, but cannot connect to GTA's cheap 20 year old server, like EVER. if you go by all the various forums around the net, neither can MOST players, AND the ones who can... get random lagspikes, &amp; disconnects for no reason what-so-ever, EVEN playing in solo-online modes...  The game may LOOK nice, but that's it... no matter how much in game cash you spend on the game's TOP END vehicles, &amp; motorcycles, they ALL handle like crap, which is sad because even going top speed they feel/look like you're going about 40 MPH compaired to real life driving... The one single airplane I've found to fly yet also handled like utter crud, Saints row TWO (not 3, or 4, or even 5, BUT TWO) had vehicles, planes, &amp; helecoptors that handled WAY, Way, way better then these do. Maybe if Rockstar cared more about gameplay, &amp; fun-factor (a term often used in the 90s by game companies, back when games actually WERE designed with FUN in mind), instead of eye candy to sell more copies to their target audience that they OBVIOUSLY hate... this game COULD have been the best all around game ever made, but instead it's the last nail in Rockstar's coffin for MANY people who, like Myself, feel as though they've been duped.  If you think playing a WAY worse story mode then GTA San andreas had (which was actually witty, &amp; fun despite being forced to play out an NWA video), as a ghetto-trash minority, in an idiotic, &amp; utterly repulsive version of LA, &amp; never want to play online, or as a custom char that looks like you, then by all means purchase this game, if you plan on playing online, go shell out 1,000 bucks for a new Playstation, &amp; hang online with all those mouthy kids.  TWO updates later, the have to turn off your video card to boot up the game error HAS been fixed, but it didn't fix anything about their cheap, old, trashy server connectivity issues that MOST players have on PC ...  I cannot believe what Microsoft, &amp; EA have turned the video game industry into since about Y2K, but it's utterly disgusting, sad that in order to play games that aren't broken, &amp; are still fun, We have to dig out old copies of games that're a decade or more old... You broke My heart Rockstar, We're through *drops mic*   ###Update### Okay after playing the game online for awhile, 'IF' your online mode will work, there's TONS of neat, &amp; fun stuff to do on this game... You can make a custom avatar to use online (even save more then one per profile), The editor is a little hard to figure out at 1st {chose mother+ father, then toggle which you look more like, then chose skintone, etc.} After that the edit is pretty easy [took Me a good hour juggling the mother/father bits to get one that even remotely looked like Me], but in the end it's worth the effort I guess... Watch out for hacktool users online, as there was almost always one in every session I was in, but when people start mocking them, they usually leave, also watch for campers sitting outside places like where the tutorial ends etc. All, n all if they manage to get MOST (preferably all) players to stay connected online with future updates, &amp; server tweeks, I do highly recomend this game... the story mode is still offensive, &amp; ridiculously 'ghetto'.  **Edit** 'IF' you can connect, &amp; stay connected online, want to spent an hour making your avatar, &amp; don't mind at least 10% of the people you encounter in freeroam, &amp; jobs (races, deathmatch, heists etc.) being hacktool users, then this honestly IS an awesome game... the cars almost always spin out when you 'TRY' to drift, but the peddal bikes, &amp; motorbikes drift quite well, The stats they make you build up during the game glitch out in multiplayer, the custom tires glitch out on motorbikes, BUT none of this is that big of deal, nor does the bugs make the game unfun... the engine Saints Row-2 was made with is WAY better for the way vehicles handle across the board, yet this game overall if the 1st sandbox game to top SR2 in overall 'FUN' factor. Oh, &amp; the plane races are asinine, &amp; all aircraft handle like crap... Hey Rockstar, go play Saints Row-2 1,000 hours for each dev, then fix your planes, AND car drifting. Still if you have a decent netspeed, &amp; 1/2 decent PC, you will prob enjoy GTA-Online, GTA-5 storymode will always suck.",1
"I really like this game for what it is. I was getting Mega Man flashbacks while I was playing this game and at points I even felt like I was playing a Mega Man game. I know that that isn't the right way to discribe this game, but you know.  It does feel punishing at points. When you die, you lose even upgrade and equipment that you earned during the level that you completed. Not only that, but there isn't any way to save any equipment that you get... unless you pay real money... UHHHHHHHH!!!! I have deep hated for games that do that! However... at least you don't have to real money to get the game.  Besides, you don't HAVE to pay real money. If you get two really good guns on a mission, you can store one or you can grind to get your stats and equipment back. So... even though it is very punishing losing your process, it is also very rewarding.  Even though I hate playing with other players... I am glad that they are their to have my back. I would say play it and see if it is for you. The only reason why I am recommending this game, is because there is no 'meh' or 'middle ground' type button. I am in the middle about this game to be honest. However... maybe they will fix it so that you don't have to pay real money to get at least one save for all your equipment.",1
"I have read others saying FFB is not as good as Asetto or others but I am enjoying it hugely with fanatec CS version 1. What a game - visuals, AI (on GT so far) are fantastic and having some great races. For me I am sitting here with a huge smile on my face just enjoying the immersion of this game. Is it perfect - no - of course not and seems there may be some AMD issue (I use Nvidia) and there are of course issues to be addressed like AI during rain lapping too quickly but for now I am enjoying this hugely and if you have all the right kit it rocks!",1
Horrible game. Dont even waste your time or money. I would rather be throwing up all day then play this game.,-1
The funniest game ive played in a long time..,1
"Excellent 'find the exit' style puzzle game. Simple mechanics, very nice puzzles, yet (so far) not frustrating ones (unlike Braid, for example...). The increase in difficulty level and introduction of new elements are very well thought out, so on one hand you are not overwhlemed, and on the other hand each you're not strolling through the game.",1
"Worth to at least look at. Combat system is pretty fun, think of Grandia/Tales of mix. Storyline is, well, jrpg storyline, moving on. Humor is nice and well placed. Game is not that grindy, if some (unless you aim to get all trophy/achieves). Items/weapon/combo system is not complicated, but requires some time. 8/10 would recommend.",1
"Most idiotic game ever built, can't jump, the mission objectives aren't clear, can't skip cut scenes and got stuck at the beginning because they put a ♥♥♥♥ing tank on a timer with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover mode and no way of finding wtf the prick wants in 26 seconds. Rubbish buy.",-1
"+ Hard, but fair gameplay + Interesting, memorable world and locations + Amazing music + Rich lore + NPCs have their own side-quests which you can follow + You can do whatever you want, you see that super important NPC? Kill him and see what happens.  + No pause button, only time you can have rest is at bonfire + No saving, if you kill someone usefull you gotta handle game without their assist till end of the game + Very interesting Covenants allowing you to e.g. protect forest and invade players who dare to make step inside. + Character can be build in a lot of different ways, light armor, magic, shields or bows, its up to player. +/-Sometimes can feel lost without idea where to proceed  - Can be frustrating when sitting in one place for too long - Few bosses can be killed with few hits or without even fighting due to implemented exploits. - PC port   Do I recommend this game? Hell yes, its one of best games I ever played. ",1
"The Game stopped developing out sadly, somewhere in my heart it felt empty somewhere in the game at some point. If it has a rework and introduction 2016 it would be one of the Greater first person shooting MOBA styled games! but sadly as it is now, it's not that great comparing to other games and there is a free version availible now.",-1
"Spec Ops: The Line. There's one title I had never really noticed, until I came across it on a top something list of good games of some kind. It was lauded for its story. The short version of this review is: everybody else is right, this is a recommendation, play it.  But why? Well, the game is a cover based, third person shooter. It gets the mechanics right except for one strange exception, being the melee button and the cover button being the same one. It's a reasonably small gripe, even if it caused a few deaths. Graphically, the level design goes from OK-but-really-generic to very interesting and in service of the story and its progression. You'll have to get past the initial genericness of it, it's worth it. Technically, the game looks fine. It doesn't have anything revolutionairy going on, but that's not what Specs Ops is about.  You play as captain Walker, who, along with two team members is sent to Dubai on a reconnaissance mission. After finding something else than they expect, Walker decides that they're on a different mission now. But during this mission the line between what's right and what's wrong continues to shift and fade. It's this story that's different from other games. Not the graphics, or the voice acting (which I think is very good btw), or the animations. Or rather: it's the idea that the game is more or less a character study, the type where at the end you think back and remember details that suddenly make sense. Or better yet: the details you missed that you notice the second time you play through it (these details are really a testament to the developer's devotion, massive thumbs up). It's is a pretty intense trip, and on the one hand it's about as much fun as it is to watch Apocalypse Now, but on the other hand, screw that and give this game a chance.",1
This game is magnificent. Fun action-fighting metroidvania sort of game with cute meta-narrative and well worth the asking price. BUY ANOTHER COPY!,1
A must have for al PC-players! 10/10,1
"Great game, worth it!",1
"Refunded the game because of a lack of split-screen co-op, a lack of reloading, no option for ADS, and no ammo to find. Who wants glowy pinatas? Not this guy. I signed up for a heavy metal demon slaying and what I got was a weightless non-stop running simulator with an industrial dubstep soundtrack and weapons that have almost no kick and feel non-punchy and weak and none of the customisation options I wanted (except for turn off glowing dudes). Sad to say I refunded. Split-screen is truly dead and so is DOOM. Doom 3 had better pacing, an actual story, better music, and you could play with friends split-screen. Doom 3 is a better game and I can't believe I'm saying it.",-1
"Great game, well worth playing",1
evertime is trie to go to stalag flucht it wont let me ,1
This game is great! The Handling and things is awesome. the 1 issue i have is in Multyplayer when smeone walks under the car it flys up and getts really anoying! but over all the best game iveplayed this year!!!,1
"From the very beginning of this game you are taken into a fantastic, captivating story. You have to play it to know it but this game is amazing.   ",1
"i would recommend the game, its fun and it can imerse you for hours although it does have its up and downs when playing, the good side is how many different choices and endings there are in the game with nearly every choice matters, the down to the game would be how i spent about 8 hours the first time i played it just to die from a wrong move in a disicion, i feel like in the game there should be choices where your suvivors actually matter, i wont spoil it but i made a wrong move and i died with like 3-5 teamates/survivors and they didnt stop the fight or anything witch resulted in me dying and keep in mind that was when the difficulty wasnt in the game so back when you couldnt choose if you wanted it on hard or not, but yeah the game has its up and downs and its a very good game and i would recomend it to anyone that likes that type of game, but i feel like the devs of the game need to add more decisions and stuff or the game will get stale.",1
"Highly recomend this game. Kinda absurd how much I like it. It feels like when I first got my hands on CoH1. The amount of fun this game brings is insane. Definitely one of the all time greats of the RTS series. At times it feels like a rehashing of the same old CoH1 stuff but for whatever reason makes you enjoy it. I went ahead and picked up the base and all the DLCs for a decent price. A bit overpriced in my opinion but for CoH fans.....worth it 100%. The amount of units at your disposal is really refreshing. The whole choice over commander thing is nice as well other than the whole buy exclusive commanders thing. The base commanders are really 'meh' but they get the job done. The negatives are there, few but they are there. Tank traps being a commander ability for others than the US EWWW, Allied forces seem underpowered (primarily the US), Pathfinding can be a bit of a pain, online player base can seem a bit childish compared to Coh1, and finally with all the interesting units I find myself angry because I simply don't have the pop cap to really exploit it. Overall 8.5/10 would buy again.",1
"It was a few hours into the game that I discovered my first Vendetta mission, a mission which involves avenging the death of another player, where my objective was to kill an Uruk that somehow killed a friend of mine. The idea of the situation was quite exciting and it wasn't long before I found a Captain wandering around some ruins. I ambushed him only to discover that he wasn't my target but rather a powerful Elite Captain known as Nákra the Black who, due to his traits, was the most difficult enemy I’d ever fought.   It wasn't bad enough that he was a crossbow-wielding enemy with rapid shots and increased damage but on top of this he could also summon hordes to assist him as well as regenerate his health. I spent the next half an hour constantly flanking him and trying to slowly take down his health with hit-and-run tactics until I finally managed to slay him with a volley of arrows. I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief that this challenging enemy was finally dead and I could press on with my mission.  Rather than continuing with the main story I decided to keep hunting Uruk Captains and doing Vendetta missions for the thrill of the hunt (as well as gaining power) where I continued to succeed and slowly improved my combat skills. It was during one of these missions that while tracking one of my targets I ended up getting ambushed myself. The Uruk looked unique in the sense that he had a cowl to hide his facial features, something which I had not seen on any other enemy, and was wielding his weapon of choice; a crossbow.   'This is just a minor setback!' I said to myself as I charged this new challenger and used my wraith powers to take a look at his stats. Examining him revealed his name as well as the fact that he had horiffic scars on his face which hurt whenever he tried to eat but something about his name and his combat style seemed familiar.  It was Nákra the Black.  I could hardly believe it when I realised he was the Elite Captain from earlier and he had only grown stronger since our last encounter. Regardless I was still determined to send him back to the grave and after some near-death experiences I finally won. Barely. However on my next hunt he came back yet again and this time he was working with a few other Uruk Captains. In my head I actually imagined the scenario of Nákra, in desperation and anger, recruiting these two Uruks to assist him in killing me once and for all. In order to survive I had to try and seperate the lesser Captains and take them out before finally clashing with Nákra and once again killing him in melee combat.  Would you believe me if I told you I actually fought him a few more times after this? how he actually survived being burnt to death just to get his long-awaited revenge? In the end I did finally put him down but there was no doubt that he was my main nemesis and it has been a while since i've been so invested in fighting any kind of NPC. This was an incredible experience and I can almost guarantee that if you buy this game you will see how the nemesis system can make your experience of this game to be just as unique and interesting as well.",1
This game offers about 2 hours of pure fun...but it ends there...,-1

"I've now played about 60 hours in story mode, most of it on the final build. In that time I've experienced one crash to desktop and three slowdowns so bad I had to quit and restart, but overall I've had a very good technical experience on max settings. The game looks great and the gameplay is fun and varied. Some of the locations are absolutely gorgeous and the design on some of the creatures is very impressive. Creation is a blast, but if you don't enjoy the process (understandable, as it does get rather fiddly) you can just as easily download ISOs or use ingame templates and items. Item creation is not a must to finish story mode, it's just another fun thing to do. The soundtrack is amazing. I'm probably buying the OST too, and that's something I've only ever done for one other game.   Combat is pretty basic. Once you get decent weapons, there's not much of a threat. (Tip: almost everything can be circle-strafed to death.) There's enough of a challenge to keep it engaging, but it's not very complex. You've got your attack and defense, ranged or melee, and that's pretty much it. I'd call it elegant rather than simplistic, but YMMV.  There's some negatives. The voice acting ranges from bad to atrocious, some plot twists are really awkwardly handled and most of the NPCs spend their days stuck in walls and falling through terrain. This is never gamebreaking, at least not in my case. My character does a lot of clipping through walls and getting stuck on the terrain, but never to the point where I have to reload. Neither me or an NPC have ever gotten irrevocably stuck, but it is annoying. Your own Minecraft-style buildings and vehicles can look jarringly blocky and out of place in the beautiful smooth landscape if you're not willing to spend many, many hours lovingly crafting them. Add it all up and you end up with a game that's very engaging, but not very immersive.   Still, the good outweighs the bad by a very large margin, and patches are still being put out. Fan created ISOs are already out there and there's some good stuff. I'd highly recommend this game. If it looks appealing to you, give it a go.",1

Very fun and challenging game not for the easily frustrated or the rage quiter. Just take a look at the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and frustration.  Only complaint I have is every now and then i get a frame stutter and it can ruin a run at some points.,1
"Do I like this game ? Sure!  Is it good ? Meh...   For first timer to the genra, it's really good, although there are flaws:  - Every single game is essentially the same. - Not much differences in each 'factions'. - The supposedly random even always contains a very clear option to select for best effect. - If you know Sid Meier's Alpha Centori, this game will be very dull to you.  BUT, for new player it is really a nice addition to the series of Civilization, one that finally us to move on after the Space Victory. One could start a Civ game (any of them really) finish it with the science space victory with the sending of a ship toward Alpha Centori and continue on in Civ: Beyond Earth.  That being said, don't get it at full price, if you can get a half or even a 30% off pricen that would be a good deal otherwise, stays away from it.",1

"This game reminds you of Legend of Zelda but it's more puzzle heavy than the typical Zelda game. You shouldn't judge a game by how many dungeons it has but by how much fun you have with that game. So far it appears to me that there is one large dungeon (the castle) along with four smaller dungeons. I'm not sure if that is the correct amount but for that price, I'd say that is a good deal and worthwhile (here I go..judging the game by the number of dungeons).",1
A timeless classic RTS.,1
"This game got me from happy and amazed by the game to emotional as fk at the end.  Gameplay is great, combat is similar to the Batman Arkham games. Vehicle gameplay is glorious because you can do all kinds of stunts. Story is well made, Max starts off alone, Max meets new people, and Max then starts losing people.  EXPLOSIONS HERE!  9/10 Combat was weird sometimes and you can't do a last second counter just like in Batman Arkham games. Game is also kinda like a GrindFest as you grind for scraps to upgrade your car and other strongholds. Other than that, game is glorious. ",1

"Fallout is an amazing series in general. Fallout: New Vegas is often looked down upon for its atmosphere changes. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas has a more action/adventure hero/villian vibe to it. Theres is more detail to the societies of the wasteland and many many ways to end the game depending on your decisions. All these endings happen in the same place but your allies and a how the wasteland ends up adjust the endings slightly more and more towards something new. If you appreciated the loneliness and slight horror aspect of Fallout 3 then you may not like New Vegas as a sequal but if you dont mind playing fallout in a new way with the same fighting style and more variability to quests then you will like New Vegas.",1

"Bad Hotel is a game that has a very simple objective but can, at times, be an unforgivably difficult trip. Protecting your hotel becomes no trivial task as you traverse the many world levels and, at a certain point, you might just find yourself devising strategies to lay waste to the various enemies and world bosses that Tarnation Tadstock, the game's antagonist, has to sabotage your hotel business. What personally hooks me into the game beyond the tower defense strategy is the impromptu beats and tunes that are generated in the background as you build up your tower to mighty proportions. Every world has its own tones and cadence that will surely have you bobbing your head to the beats in a different way all the way through.  I wouldn't go overlooking this game because of its looks or its simplistic gameplay, you'd be surprised how amusingly addicting it is.",1

" Graphics  Well detailed game. You can read (albeit dangerous) the license plates on other cars. The lighting from the sun shines off high gloss paint jobs like in real life. The small detail damages are realistic; if you broke a headlamp it stays broken and doesn’t light up. The back ground is realistic enough to tell distance. I’ve played this at both regular television and hi definition 1080p while it is still good at the lowest setting I highly recommend the playing at the highest possible detail.   Sound and Music  You can tell from just driving around what types of cars are around you with even having to look at that area. The screeching of the tires to the roar of an engine is clear with any vehicle you use. Now the music, quantity or quality wise you will not be disappointed. There are a lot of songs that play while driving around so chances are if you play for an hour or two, you will not hear the same song twice. And you don’t like a particular song you can always take if off the play list. One should note that a good portion of songs are the same songs from older Burnout Games.   Game Play  As you win events you upgrade your license. The higher the license, the larger amount of vehicles you will be able to use. These events are littered all thought Paradise City. To start the event simple pull up to a light to start it.  Here is the events.  Races: Standard Race. From one to seven other opponents you drive to a specific end point. Road Rage: Timed Event. You use your vehicle as a battering ram to smash other vehicles into traffic, walls or other hard objects. Target amount is usually displayed. Event ends when either you take to much damage or time ends.  Marked Man: Almost like a race. You goal is to reach one destination while four other computer cars try to inflict enough damage to keep you from reaching your destination.  Stunts: Use your vehicle like a little acrobat, jumping off ramps, crashing bill boards and doing spins. The more you do in a sequence the more points you get. There is a target score to get per event.  Burning Route: One route per vehicle. It’s a timed race where you just have to get to the finish line by a certain time using a certain vehicle. Every route you finish unlocks a upgraded version of the vehicle used. All these events get a bit more difficult as the game wears on but not that much more. I would say once you get used to the way the game plays you find that most of these events range from easy (one or two attempts) to medium (fifteen minutes maximum).  Now there are a few side events or tasks that are fun to do. Running certain billboards, barriers, and super jumps. They are littered everywhere, cant be avoided just driving around. There are few hidden but find to fun all of them and as a reward for finding all it unlocks more vehicles. There are also two events per street, one is time trails and the other is showtime. Showtime is just you bouncing around hitting vehicles for points.  Online play is quite fun with tasks and races, connections are usually stable. One thing I like is with Xbox Live Vision take a photo of you when you get taken out by another drive and sent to the aggressor. The online experience is a whole new game in itself and worth playing.   Negatives  Although it’s a very good game here is a few of the things I didn’t like. Showtime is very repetitive in the sense you have to do it to all 64 streets of Paradise City. Also Showtime replaced Crash from previous games. The on line challenges are very repetitive where if 2 players you have to do it for 7 players. And some of them are very very basic like driving in oncoming traffic. Also while doing online challenges if one person get disconnected, the challenges are cancelled. The difficulty level is somewhat misleading as the more cars you unlock the easier the game is when trying to do the events. One last thing that kind of surprised me is the amount of advertising in the game, from billboards to vans there is way too much advertising in this game. To show how much advertising there are four unlockable cars, all of them are plastered with the names.",1
"pretty good Classic. Free play gets boring, and the missions are pretty easy. But as good as a sim city game, so I'd recomend it.",1
"24 Hours ‘til Rescue is in the same vein of a previous title by the developer, known as Hotel Apocalypse. Whereas the previous game was a little more like a sandbox and story based game, this one seems to be a bit more focused on survival, unlike the previous title.  24 Hours ‘til Rescue is created in an engine we all know, but don't necessarily love and that is good old RPG Maker. The issue with games built in this engine tends to be the lack of ingenuity or originality, as a worrying amount of developers assume they can make a quick bit of cash from a second rate RPG. I am thankful to say that this game isn't the case, just like a few others the developer has designed. Instead, they've opted for both their own style in graphics and gameplay.  Graphically the game makes use of its own art assets, one thing that not all that many RPG Maker games can boast about. Thanks to this it helps the game environment you're currently stuck in bring about a feeling of hopelessness and help develop the surroundings you're in, of which is a city plagued by zombies, set for its own downfall.  Gameplay, just like the graphics of the game take their own original stance by having a more action-oriented system. You see, gameplay revolves around real time when you're in-game. There will be zombies wandering all around, but they won't be standing around, giving you a chance to choose your attack so you can bosh them over the head. Nope! They're going to go straight for you, and unless you respond in a timely manner, they're going to take a chunk out of your health.   To retaliate, you must kite the zombies to line up with your character so that you may take an accurate shot at them and knock down some of their own health, although, when there is that many zombies hanging around, it does get a little difficult to get an accurate shot out due to the fact you’re trying not to die! The more action-packed gameplay keeps things interesting and creates a much more stressful situation for the player as a whole.  The game totes multiple difficulties, some of which are permadeath, whereas others are not. If you want the extra challenge of permadeath then you may, but it isn’t forced upon you, which is a nice addition, even if the game tends to be rather difficult anyway. So, it certainly doesn’t hurt to spend some time on the easier difficulties to at the very least get your bearings. However, 24 Hours ‘til Rescue does have an arcade like highscore system, which only takes place on the permadeath difficulties, so be sure to keep that in mind if your score is important to you.  To keep things fresh for each and every run you go on, you can pick and choose your starting characters, all of which have their own starting items. Every new character will involve a slightly different start to the game, and can even make for a difference in difficulty depending on how well you play with each of those starting items. At the start of the game you only have access to the two, but the further and deeper into the game you get; the more you will proceed to unlock.  Obviously, you won’t be able to survive the apocalypse with just your typical handgun, even less so if you start to run out of bullets. Thankfully, if you can find your way through the city you might be able to locate a workbench, an area where you can craft both ammo and weapons to use on the undead hordes that fill the streets with their blood and guts. To make these weapons and ammunition you’re going to need to find a fair amount of items, all of which are completely spread out around the city. These parts and items are everywhere and are a little difficult to miss, but when it comes down to it, the main reason you’re going to skip out on some free items is down to the fact there’s an undead shambler beside that wants your guts for garters.   Throughout your exploration in the game you’ll come across a number of buildings, the majority of which you can just waltz right into. Unfortunately, these buildings tend to be filled to the brim with zombies and there isn’t that many light sources to help you see into the home. Armed with nothing more than a simple flashlight, it makes things a little difficult and tense whenever you enter a new home to scavenge for items.  Story in the game doesn’t appear to be too big of a focus, but that could just be me only scratching the surface of it all. The gist of the story is this: the apocalypse has broken out, and you want to escape from it. You can hitch a ride on a helicopter, only if you find Patient Zero, retrieve a blood sample, and bring it with you to the extraction point, 24 hours after initial contact. The whole “survive for 24” hours thing is where the main survival aspect of the game comes in, and is the main gameplay feature of the game. If you can’t survive for that long, then don’t expect to see the end credits; only a game over screen.  At times the game does have some frame-drops from time to time, and is definitely something that could be done with a fix, but for the most part the game appears to be pretty solid and stable, and I don’t have too much doubt personally that the devs will do something about the framerate in due time.  Overall, 24 Hours ‘til Rescue is a fun little survival game with a fair amount of difficulty implemented into it. There’s plenty to do in the game from typical scavenging, or accomplishing quests to help move the story along some more. The original art assets that are rarely seen in RPG Maker games is a nice change and makes the game feel like its own property, rather than another game made in RPG Maker. If you’re at all fans of the previous title by the same developers, Hotel Apocalypse, then it’s safe to say you’ll enjoy this one, too.   All I can say is just give it a try, regardless of if you have played the dev’s previous title. It’s an inexpensive little survival game that is worth your time and brings something a little new to the RPG Maker scene.",1
"compared to other CoD games within the series, iv yet to decide whether i like it yet as only got it a few days ago.  my personal opinion of this game is that the gameplay just isnt CoD to me, it feels more like Cs:Go with the CoD theme, the lack of settings and the such high recommended system specs for this game is a bit of a let down as not every 1 can afford to have such a high spec'd machine, luckily im 1 of those fortunate enough to have a decent pc. the FOV is a let down although you can download a FOV changer with no comebacks of getting banned etc, i havent noticed any fps drops or bugs as of yet, whether this is down to my pc and not really noticing them, i dont know. the biggest let down for me is no support for the cheating side of the game, not vac secure and no support from developers. i dont know my opinion is mixed, i feel it could be a good game if there was a bit more support, but then can it campare to the likes of black ops 2 and mw3 ? personally, i dont think so......",-1
"i wish this game was not so overwhelming in stuff to do.. works well, looks well but.. too much bloat..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q85-576upYo ",-1
"This is a very interesting horror-themed first person shooter. Yes, it came out way back in 1999, so the graphics are dated by today's standards.   I finally got around to playing it because the highly entertaining Bioshock series was made by the same guy, Ken Levine. I also remember playing and enjoying System Shock 1 many years ago so nostalgia had something to do with it. The intro to System Shock 2 tells you what happened in the previous game, though, so don't feel you need to play the original to enjoy the sequel.  So, despite the dated graphics, is it still scary and/or fun? Hells YES, on both counts!   I'll give an example of the scariness/awesomeness:  You're trapped on a spaceship that has been taken over by hostile aliens. The aliens also control the ship's computer system, so the ship's normally helpful steward robots have now become automated suicide bombers. They will walk up to you and self destruct, usually while spouting some cheery greeting or friendly banter.   As part of your travels you have to go through a darkened cargo bay with crates stacked everywhere and many tight spaces. I got to the middle of the cargo bay before I realized that all the crates around me were storage crates for the suicide steward robots, and that all the crates said 'READY' on them in big green letters. Sure enough, as soon as I turn my back on the crates I hear the sound of them breaking open, and a horde of robots is coming right at me, giving me friendly greetings all the while! Talk about a mixture of shock, horror, and excitement!!!  The game has strong RPG elements. At the start you are given the choice of being a combat oriented Marine, a technical oriented Naval Ops guy, or a Psionic Operative -- basically a high tech Jedi or wizard or whatever you want to call it. You're given a large amount of different skills to choose from, but you'll only have enough skill points to master a few so you have to choose wisely.  The large number of skills and items means you have many options for defeating the obstacles in your path. Is a big mean security bot ruining your day? Use your psi powers to turn invisible and walk past him. Or switch to armor piercing bullets to destroy him. Or hack a security turret to open fire on your enemy.  There are many mini-games that come with System Shock 2. You'll get a 'GamePig' fairly early on that will let you play games completely unrelated to the main plot, everything from Tic Tac Toe to a racing game to an Ultima clone! Hells yeah!  But not everything is good about System Shock 2.  For one thing the game has a steep learning curve, and it is very difficult. Even a single enemy can kill you without too much trouble, and even when you're doing well you're always short of resources. This goes along with the survival horror theme but it can be frustrating at times. I'm a veteran first person shooter player, but after a few hours of getting slaughtered on 'Normal' difficulty I had to swallow my pride and restart on 'Easy.'  Another gripe I had was the inventory management system was annoying. You'll quickly run out of space, and the only way to get more space is to spend precious skill upgrade points on Strength, a skill of otherwise dubious usefulness. And even after I maxed out my Strength score I was still running out of space! Argh!  As for the plot, it was nine kinds of awesome. There are several plot twists and I don't want to be too spoilerish, but I will say that the climactic finale of the game was a crowning moment of awesome. I only wish that more games had this kind of emphasis on storytelling.  So System Shock 2 is a flawed game, yes, but it's worth looking past the flaws because in the end you'll find a hidden gem. If you like Bioshock, Deus Ex, or survival horror games you owe it to yourself to check out System Shock 2.",1
"Simple, yet very fun and addictive.",1
"- Light hearted dungeon crawler with focus on SLG type love story arcs - Press A / R trigger through pages of blandish dialogue of try-hard characters - Walk through Persona-inspired dungeons, slice through uninspiring droves of monsters  - Build great harem, make children by touching hands - Disown hundreds children who suck and send them to work as slaves - Talk to their moms to recharge baby gauge - Make more star children - One children has rare job + level 99 cap - Rinse and repeat  ________________  Perhaps not as boring as other Jrpgs, some new concepts being added here and there. Combat is not revolutionary but UI and controls are smooth and grinding is a breeze (if not brainless activity)   Likes:   1. Making star children with good potential is like pokemon all over again. Gotta catch em' all. Gotta breed until i get a platoon of level 99s. The grind is real tho. Only 2 out of a gazillion children were elite? It's a drug.  2. Characters have distinct personality apart from being very HAIR-COLOR CODED. I mean. You get to know some of these chicks. If you care about knowing what girls think you'll like this. There's a story line going on for each of em. Pick your poison.  Gripes:  1. Stupid research lab/guild quest system. If i had to pick up quests each time and go back and forth trying to figure out what monster im supposed to kill 10 times, that's bad design. Let me take a quest, bring me to the correct floor of the dungeon, and let me grind away. I don't wanna waste minutes pressing away at menus.  2. Crashes very occasionally. Happened only once in 6 hours but... ♥♥♥♥ me in the ♥♥♥ if my last save was TWO HOURS AGO. Autosave, anyone heard of it?  OVERALL ENJOYABLE GAME",1

"What a noisy, obnoxious, lame game. As soon as you start, you're treated to a boring training video that they (seemingly) try to make exciting by having a noisy extreme sports guy voicing over it, shouting things that are supposed to sound cool. Once you get through that consciousness-sapping dull video, you play the game. You press a button or click your mouse to send the ball flying at stuff with the intention of breaking it. The more stuff you break, the better your score. There are little bonus things the game has for you to do which can improve your score, but if you miss getting the ball in the hole, you lose HALF your points.  The ball is difficult to control, and you can make it fall straight down, ending one of your two hits to the ball. If you're unfortuante enough to be more than 1-2 feet away from the hole, you're pretty much screwed and will knock the ball across the entire room, even though the game tells you that you're 'putting' at this point. So to reiterate, I found this game to be loud, obnoxious, and boring, in the short time that I could be bothered to play it.",-1

"Suprisingly fun. Simple but if a Marvel fun I really recommend it if only for a fun OPEN WORLD romp through New York / Marvel World.   I had a blast running around and seeing buildings like the stark tower and such. I even enjoyed the Mario esque platformer puzzles which force you to use characters power to solve.  It is extremly simple and geared for kids, but ignoring that I thought it was great. Best part was running around the main city GTA style crushing citizens cars because....Hulk MAD! Huge world to explore.  Also this game does a fantastic job of making Hulk a powerful monster to play as, something few games have done correctly before.",1

"It's violent, gruesome, and down-right offensive. But this Zelda-like dungeon crawler kept me playing until 100% completion. It’s a game if you only got a bit of time to play and want to see what wacky combo’s you’ll obtain later in the game. So shed those tears and give this game a try.",1

"A very original game! Visuals are great, astonishing urban scenarios with a really cool use of vivid colors. The plot is nice, the sound is OK and the parkour gameplay is very fun! I really felt involved, specially with the 'don't kill anyone' idea...  And Mirror's Edge 2 is coming up! if it follows the formula of this one, it has everything to be great too!",1

"Oh, you should know I cried while played this game, and cried a lot. I finished this game in 2015, That was a cold spring and I was ill and feel depressed. In 2014 I have lost my home, my work and many things which were precious to me due to the war in the East of Ukraine. I have brought my family to the west, however, in addition I brougth a nightmers with me too. I was frightened by sinister forecasts. Even now I realize that my life will never be the same again.  The story was given in chapters, and this story about love and humanity, and how difficult to hold them when a BAD things happen.",1
Nice game but this sounds uhhhh sucks,1
"This game is amazing. The environment and setting are far better than any other MMO I have played. The fact that a large majority of the quests in game have voice acting and cut scenes sets it apart right away.   The gameplay is fun and feels more involved than other MMOs. The quests require actual thought and I have found myself using the built in web browser to look up random facts to figure out how to solve the current puzzle many times. If you try to solve every puzzle on your own without looking up the solution this game will keep you entertained and sometimes stumped for days. Even the few and far between 'gather' quests are all unique. There are awesome dungeons 5 man+, random server events where you are tasked to work with people on the server to defeat things that appear, PvP and a great guild(cabal) system.  The leveling system is great. No levels.  Ok levels.. kind of.. whenever you gain enough experience you unlock ability points to put into either skills or areas where you can modify your stats. At no point are you locked into a class you can spec for another class and switch when you like with the points you gain from 'leveling' and no cap or even really a level number(as far as I know)  The story is really where this game wins though probably due to the extra effort put in for the voice acting and very regular cut scenes. The missions as I said above really make you think and keep you invested in what is going on. The amount of lore you can find either by the hidden lore items you find or just by talking to quest givers and NPCs that you find is insane. If you play.. when you play.. make sure to click the dialog text multiple times I did not know about that when I first started. The NPCs have a lot of dialog if you are into that. The lore mixed with the awesome environments makes this game by far my favorite MMO.",1
"Definatly a classic. I really like the art style, good storyline, and balanced weapons and monsters. The only part I don't like is when I get stuck and don't know where to go and how far I am to escaping or completing a part/chapter. After playing Portal for a while, this game seems really long too.",1
"-Pros Great graphics, amazing community and outstanding mods and community made missions make this game an all time favorite for me. Fun to play with your mates and goes for cheap on summer and winter sale.    -Cons -RUNS LIKE ♥♥♥♥ Even with a overclocked GTX 1070 and a i7 6700k @4.5ghz this game barely runs at very high @1440. I'd say you need AT LEAST a gtx 750ti or r7 360 with a low end i5 or fx6300to consider this game playable @1080 in most game modes (and this game was made in 2009!!!).",1
GREAT GAME 50 MILLION WAIT NO SCRATCH THAT 694876 MILLION OUT 10 ACTUALLY EVEN MORE THAN THAT #spag bog #papy #DOGS! This is a great game and i hightly recomend this game:)   The only complaint of ths game is one youve did the endings im kinda just sitting here waiting for some fan games or announcement from toby fox cause dont get me wrong this is an AMAZING game and look at that review i gave it 694876 million out of 10 but what im saying is what now? i did everything. but really im an ungreatful git saying cause i spent £7.99 on that amazing game.

"I honestly hesitated a lot between recommanding it or not.  The graphics are awesome, the gameplay is as epic as Assassin's Creed 3 and the story is so-so.  But you have to explore the game a lot otherwise many quests will be bugged such as forts that you have to capture before certain missions in the campaign.   My previous campaign was ♥♥♥♥ed up because of the fact I advanced too much and when I tried to do the quest after capturing a fort they told me to destroy english ships but there were only spanish ships because I was already too far into the campaign.  But other than that the exploring in this game is perfect, the sea fighting is awesome, I had fun during my first 2 campaigns.  It's worth buying it for its current price to be honest but you have to explore a lot especially capture forts before advancing into the campaign.  7/10  ",1
Could get addicting if you can get past the grind. Can sink A LOT of hours.,1
"This game isn't very long, it isn't very deep, but it is fun. It feels like a very polished version of a game design school project. The movement is spot on, and the puzzles are pretty easy but still satisfying. Didn't take very long to play through but I feel like I got my money's worth. Check it out.",1
"Started out intense but 30 minutes in you realize the patterns of enemy movements and the horror aspect falls apart from there. Besides a few jumpscares and some chases with a few enemies, the game was uninteresting and at some points flat out boring. Constantly being pushed away from your goal just before you're about to reach it is annoying. This game is barely worth the 4 bucks I spent on it (via steam sale). Not to mention the BIG payoff for all your work at the end. (Sarcasm)",-1

"I got XCOM EU for free from some random site promotion and was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. That's why I pre-paid this one.  XCOM 2 is a great game, it's not that mind blowing as EU+EW combo (partially because it's a sequel and we haven't had an expansion for this one). It still is a very solid game, fun and challenging with better graphics, more difficulty and procedural maps.  I'm also OK with timers (at least on non-Legendary) and was lucky enough not to encounter any game breaking bugs. Have to mention huge highlights of this game - modding avaliability, thanks Firaxis and HUGE thanks to all the people who spend their time and energy designing mods and sharing them with other - you guys are awesome!  All in all this game scores around 85 out of 100 for me. You should definitely consider getting this (especially on sales).",1

"I've never really played any visual novels before this. I'm not much into anime. Some friends in my GMod community had played through some of this and it seemed like an interesting story. I get it on a whim (it is free after all) and I can say that I'm beyond impressed. The character development, the plot(s), the artwork, and everything are amazing. It still has some minor imperfections in translation, but damn, I've never felt as much of a connection to a game as I have this. It's exactly like reading an incredible book but with visuals. I still have most bad endings to complete, but I'm going to be sad when I've gone through this VN because it keeps beckoning me back to play more. And best of all, it's free. Do yourself a favor and play this.   As for the future, there are some things that would be nice to see in future updates. Proofreading will be patched soon it seems. I would like to see a Zhenya and/or Olga ending, maybe even an Elektronik or Shurik ending that those who roll that way would like (or just to see how the plot would go in that case) Regardless, I can't say enough good things.

"A very difficult action-platformer that demands a great deal of patience and memory in order to suceed. It's sort of like Dark Souls, in 2D.  While challenging, it never feels unfair. The game provides a consistant challenge all the way through, with solid movement and combat mechanics.  Doing well rewards Volgarr with powers to do even more well (yes, that's a thing, ask anyone). Do badly however, and the game strips Volgarr of said power.  Recommended to any looking for a challenge.",1

"This game is fun and addicting for some reason. Kind of a mix of CS with class based teams. The better you do each map the more guns you unlock and your rank goes up. Friendly fire is on which I do like so no more hording a hallway with out getting teamkilled. Also you can choose a squad, for me I like this when playing with friends to keep track where we are. Yes it is another Source mod but it is very unique and is worth a try. Oh, and it has gibs for those gore fans too.",1
"This is the second game in a trilogy which utterly essential if you love point 'n 'click games. I would go so far as to say, story wise I prefer Black Mirror to even the mighty Broken Sword; it's a very beautiful game to look at, and very clever. It feels as though it had mighty production values, which is probably a result of the above average artwork and score.  In my review of Black Mirror, I recommended beginning the trilogy by playing the games out of their chronological order, on the basis that two II and III are a batter introduction to the overall story, and tonally different enough to the first that if you played part one and didn't enjoy it, you would be making a mistake not playing the sequels. it is difficult to stand by this decision having played through all three games recently, as there are a number of recurring characters and locations you will appreciate more having played the first game, but I stand by my comments.  Black Mirror II introduces us to a new protagonist, Darren Michaels (significantly more contemporary and relatable than Samuel), and begins in the good ole' US of A. The backdrops are drawn beautifully, and the characters all come to life in their own little ways, in a similar manner to the first game. The locations are rich and detailed, and it isn't long before things begin to get a little strange. There are hints of sinister goings on in Fuller's store (Fuller being Darren's incredibly seedy boss) and before you know it, the infamous Willow Creek and Black Mirror castle finds it's way into the story, and it's here that the game really comes into it's own.  How the game references the first, is an absolute work of genius. From Gordon's Palace (a refurbished mental asylum referenced much and visited in the first game) to the museum depicting the terrible murders which took place some twelve years prior, the Black Mirror games represent a complete and well woven story, which truly feels like a meticulously planned trilogy, from beginning to end. Locations from the former game are revisited to satisfying effect. We meet old faces again, and all the while the game manages to maintain a tone of mystery and unease, drawing you into the sleepy yet sinister little town of Creek.  It is to review the game without giving too much away, and it's worth playing knowing as little about the story as possible. There are, however, some cons to , chiefly:  - The voice acting. Some of the characters are just awful for some reason, in particular Tom. How they managed to do such a bad job of his accent is truly a thing to behold. - The final section of the game goes a bit puzzle crazy. At the one time you want nothing more than to move the story forward, you're hammered with contrived puzzles left right and centre, and frankly it all gets a bit much. - The BM games are famously dialogue heavy. This one isn't as bad as the first, but by god some characters do like to yappity yap.  Heartily recommended overall though. There aren't many games like this out there, and if you can put up with a couple of dodgy accents and a whole lot of chatter, it's an experience you will never forget.",1
"This gam is brilliant, made by James Cameron of the famed Pirrahna II movie   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082910/    Stephen Hawkins was employed to do the fisix, so I rate this a pretty damn god good gam",1
"I got it on sale, was like $3 or so equivalent. Its all worth it. If you are looking for casual gaming, with a quick reaction button smashing, advanced 8th generation console graphic quality, smooth and cool fighting actions, then this is the game for you. This is the game I first completed and were a worthy trial of my new 980Ti.  The game is however, lack of RPG element, lack of replayability and you are like walking on a narrow tunnel while you are actually inside the huge Rome and Britain setting around you, those are its limitation.   I ran through the game just fine, casual efforts. Story side is not something that punch out, but still acceptable. I havent tried to deal with multiplayer,  Get it while on sale, its a short run of enjoyable graphical and action elements. But stay away of it if you are looking for what I mention as its limitation.",1
This game consistently crashes after the first T Rex chase. I resolved that by turning off some effects settings. Not sure which on fixed it. Now the problem is that the game crashes to desktop when I try to charge with the Triceratops.,-1
What an awesome use of narrative to make an action/rpg/platformer feel alive and personal.  10/10 would recommend.,1
"Frustration, stress...and good food. Perfect game to play inconspicuously during lecture. ;)",1
"Bought the game on sale.  Can't even log in and connect to a server, a problem many other players have been facing for some time now.  Kinda glad I didn't buy the game at full price.  Should've checked the reviews, there's a reason the first page is only negative.  UPDATE: After finally being able to play the game I paid for, I still cannot recommend. There's a crushing boredom scavenging for supplies and then being immediately killed when sighted by someone else. I think I got shot, I'm just not sure because it was over as soon as I saw him. This happens a lot to me C:",-1
"Did you play 'The Walking Dead' season 1 or 2? Did you like it? If you did, this game is definately for you, as it has the same pros and cons.  8/10.",1
i want to gift my friend the game but he said Wait 30DAy -_- affff,-1
Great game that shows your will the keep on striving and to make it instresting makes your choices that range from great investments to scams and to really set back to you competitors. Also There are alot of hidden suprises waiting for you. Also you are a basicly recreating the history of how a man can develope one game and become a figure to remember in the gaming world. I HIGHLY recomend it.,1
"TL:DR A really enjoyable semi-open stealth game that gives you lots of options to complete you goals. Let down only slightly by the terrible boss fights.  Full version: Deus Ex HR has you playing as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop turned security officer for the augment company Sarif industries, who's girlfriend Megan is killed in a terrorist attack on the Sarif building. Jensen himself is badly injured but saved by Sarif who also augments him. He returns to work a few months later and begins investigating the attack which draws him into a deeper plot.  The gameplay is semi-open stealth focused with a lot of flexibility in how you want to complete your objectives. You can hack terminals to acquire info or passwords, hack locks to open doors, discover vents and alternative routes through levels and you have a variety of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Though the game tries to steer you towards non-lethal stealth via more exp you can absolutely loud and violent if you want. Conversations and convincing other characters also play a part as well.  The Directors Cut adds the DLC Missing Link into the main story, slightly improved boss fights and a new game plus mode that carries over your unlocked augs.  Good points: - Great stealth gameplay  - The wide variety of options you have to go about your tasks is refreshing and its just as fun finding your own path to complete a mission. - Has some great level design to the open hubs of Detroit and Hengsha and the various other compunds and buidlings you have to infiltrate. -The upgrade system is fantastic as you can unlock new augments are improve or add stuff to the ones you have, which opens up more options for you when tackling a level.  Bad points: - While they have been improved to make stealth more viable the boss fights still suck. Playing a non-lethal stealth? Well the game throws you into a small room with a powerful gun toting bullet sponge. The DC edition has more options in the boss fights for a stealth build now but they still suck. - The Missing Link DLC feels a bit shoehorned into the main campaign. As it was initially a seperate chapter you played, you lose all your upgrades and weapons at the start. Given you play it late in the storyline this is kind of annoying. It also has a lot of backtracking though it has its good moments. You do get all your upgrades back at the end as well as keeping the ones you earned in Missing Link so thats a bonus at least.",1
"An Extremely Short Visual through the Eyes of a young 13 year old boy named Cantus, (A boy who views the world around him as nothing but white noise) Meet the Mysterious Girl Named Maris.  Now as i stated above this Novel Is Very Short(About Half an Hour's Read, 45(minutes) - an Hour if you read through all the different dialogue choices including the shells) But the Story itself is Driven through the Lighthearted Dialogue between the two Main Characters. This is of course, the main entertainment factor of the Visual Novel.  Granted this Is the Free Version, So to my Current knowledge there might be more in the 'pay for' version. But considering it's free, unless you are strict on time, there isn't much of a reason to give this Visual Novel a Quick Read through.  Quick List of Pros  - Enjoyable Music - Likable art - Short But Cute Story Quick List of Cons - For how Nice the Music is there is only 2-3 Different Tracks, it's almost downright depressing",1
"The unit upgrade system was kinda nice but thats its only saving grace for me alot of the rest feels dumbed down or no thought put into it what so ever, Everything feels like a rehashed mod of Civ V energy = gold, health = happyness, culture = well culture guess they ran out of ideas there.  -Characters/factions have zero personality and most conversations are not voiced making me not care. -The dipomacy system has been replaced with favour's eg: give me 3 stratigic resources and AI grants you 1 favour (if you go to war all favours you saved dissapear making me completly ignore this system and not trade with AI). -AI is still bad -Tech tree is confusing (there is a seach filter but you need to know the name, If i knew the name i wouldnt need the search) -cant build basic roads after you research magrails (magrails have buildtime and cost doubled) There are far more examples these are just a few that annoyed me.  Overall this game is a step backwards from previous Civ games and wouldnt recommend to fans of Civilization.  Note: i havent tried the rising tide dlc i heard they removed a few of the annoying features but from what ive read its still not worth it  ",-1
"It's a VN but it's also a game where you mix drinks and get drunk or try to get the other person drunk, either or. Fun game. Gotten it long before it was officially out on Steam so I've played the prequel which has my vote for this game.",1

"If you haven't played this game by now, and are curious about buying it on sale, let me save you the money - this game is awful. The terrible story is made worse by terrible acting, and the horrible controls will leave you frustrated. You will feel empty inside upon 'completing' this terrible game as it does not bother trying to tell a coherent story worth the trouble.  I cannot write 'terrible' enough to convey how bad this game is.  Making it through the game without shooting anyone sounds like it would be a creative challenge, but instead, you are forced to slug it out in at least three areas with the enemy. They position themselves at exit points that take several seconds to get by, such as climbing a pipe or turning a hand wheel to open a door, so getting by while they are shooting at you is impossible. This is further complicated by the wonky disarm system that only works some of the time and the crummy combat controls.  Believe me when I say that I wanted to like this game - I played it all the way through after all. But in the end, I feel this game was not even worth the $5 I spent to get it on sale, and certainly not worth the few hours it took to play through it.",-1
I played this while I was in the hospital the other day and screamed so loud the nurses came in the room in a panic :3 11/10 would freak nurses out again,1
"Fantastic game, It may be dated now, Deffinatly worth purchaseing if it goes on sale!",1
"For .19 cents this game far exceeds what it's worth...and that's not even including trading cards! If you have .19 cents and want a decent game, it's a no brainer.",1
It's a game.,1
"This game is just click here, click there, click to rest, than start to click again.  Very easy and very short. Finished in 4hours with 37on38 achievement. Meh, buy it just if you are looking for a calm an relaxing atmosphere, with the left hand on warm..... :D",1
Great game :),1
"No feeling like HATE would inspire this game. I especially like that they published it on monday, for all those frustrated people after hard day at work.  Now waiting for controversial mods.   Ps. I'm not particularly inspired to reenact this in real life.",1
Amazing classic game. It seems to have the graphis of most of the interactive characters/NPS upgraded a bit over the original Playstation release.,1
"It tries to sell itself as action-survival-horror, seemingly oblivious to the fact that action and horror are diametrically opposed.  Just like every other game where action is meant to be balanced alongside horror, the horror falls flat. If you want a gory shooter, this works well. If you're looking for something actually scary, try Silent Hill, Amnesia, or some other choice horror games.",-1
Just like any other Batman Arkham game ♥♥♥♥ing BRILLIANT !!!,1
Its not all that but its fun.,1

♥♥♥♥ing yes. Buy this when it isn't on sale. my first hour of play:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIzDvLpe7FM ,1
Its great m8,1
"This game I bought short after release, but it is only recently I started playing with. After 2-3 games I started to really really enjoy, what I see. I think after a few tries I never ever went ahead and fought battles manually, I prefer just spectating them fight, or autoresolve. The expand and exploit aspect of the game is really remarkable, you have to account for many many things when settling new cities, building new districts, deciding where to expand, what exactly to build, what to research, and it all is very well balanced ! You can decide to have a stronger overall empire, or just to focus on research for example, given the terrain supports it.  There are like 7 types of victory conditions, the one where you have to collect dust... a LOT of dust (dust is the ingame money) is somewhat hard... There are a lot of things to watch out for, if you wanna accomplish that, tho certain factions are bound to get different type of victory conditions easier. There are 8ish factions, they can be played in any way you see fit, tho given their traits, it would be easier to go for the pre-set victory conditions. Each of the factions represent an unique playstyle. I don't have the guardians dlc, as I don't see how it'd add much to my gameplay experience, it may be really good, but other than the guardians themselves, I don't see how the game against AI would improve. AI is nice tho, they don't behave unreasonably, there are reason to their actions, they are nice opponents. In multiplayer everyone seem to use custom created factions, and just go for the win with them, so I'll definetley play on servers, where these preset factions are not allowed. The game is fun, and due to the well generated maps, it feels fresh. I only played it for so much time, but I can see myself playing it more and more ! Recommended 7.5/10",1
"Highly scary, deep corridors, dimly lit rooms. Absolutely frightening at some points.",1
Greatest RTS for me,1
"Once you get the hang of the controls this is a super fun shooter. You fly a cute little plane which you can maneuver into all sorts of amazing (if slightly unrealistic) stunts and flips, to out run and out gun the many enemies on screen. The aim.... Survive as long as you can.. The longer you survive the more intense things get, so far i lasted about 5 miutes max with bullets and planes gunning for you from all directions.. There's some customisation availible for your plane which adds a nice bit of choice to the way you can approach the game. There's something special about this one",1
"You start out in a bedroom, in the dark. Find a light switch, great. Now walk around the house to find things. Find more light switches, fine. Oh what's this , a locked door! Go to other room, there is boltcutters that you can't pick up! You stall around waiting for the game to go through it designed delays. As you are bored out of your mind , the lights go out. Ok , go find a main switch in the bathroom. Ok lights are back on, whoppie! You are still waiting for something to do. You find a safe that need a code. Ok , let's look around for some hints to what it is. There is none. Now the lights go out again. You now have to use endless short timed matches to make your way back to the main switch but when you get there , the handle is missing. Ok fine, at least I have something to do again. Found the handle and turned light back on.  At this piont I should mention that some scary creature pops up a few times, like you were dreaming or something. It doesn't do anything but disappears. Light go out again but no way to turn them on again. Back to matches. By this time your probably asking your, why am I waiting my time with this crap game. That's what I was thinking. Finally the creatures opens a door that was not an option before. You go in to find this large enemy, that moves like an 8 bit computer did. It kills you.  After many tries to find out what to do next, it tell you how to run. Great I have to run away from this guy, down dark corridors that are more of a maze then a house.  Well enough of being killed over and over.",-1
It's good if you have a team!,1
"The game is set in London, England. The Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation. Something goes very wrong during the process of the experiments and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and eventually invade parts of enterprise security. Hours later, the first waves of specimens begin to invade the surface, disturbing the peace protest outside the headquarters of the military contractor Horzine. Despite the efforts of the local police, civilians are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seeming endless wave of clones now flowing out of the headquarters of Horzine Biotech. Having escaped their prisons, the creatures begin to spread through the neighboring areas, devouring the helpless civilians while the London Metropolitan Police bravely but futilely try to stem the tide of mutated flesh and blood spreading through the city. Desperate to contain the explosion of mutation and prevent countries outside this range, as planned by the scientist Dr. Kevin Clamley (shortly called as Patriarch) now also equipped mutant and cybernetically, the British government quickly begins to organize teams with the rest of the survivors British army and police Special Branch, to fight the hordes of mutant specimens that had already spread through the capital and its suburbs. The player assumes the role of an anonymous member of these teams in their variety of missions in and around London.",1
